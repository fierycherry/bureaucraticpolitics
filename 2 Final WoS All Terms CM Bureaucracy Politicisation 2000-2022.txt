AB Although politicization is a perennial research topic in public administration to investigate relationships between ministers and civil servants, the concept still lacks clarification. This article contributes to this literature by systematically identifying different conceptualizations of politicization and suggests a typology including three politicization mechanisms to strengthen the political responsiveness of the ministerial bureaucracy: formal, functional and administrative politicization. The typology is empirically validated through a comparative case analysis of politicization mechanisms in Germany, Belgium, the UK and Denmark. The empirical analysis further refines the general idea of Western democracies becoming simply' more politicized, by illustrating how some politicization mechanisms do not continue to increase, but stabilize - at least for the time being. Points for practitioners The claim of increasing politicization of the interaction between ministers and civil servants is often made in research and government practice. As the completely neutral bureaucracy is a myth rather than empirical reality, all democracies have to balance demands for both neutral expertise and political responsiveness. The latter often involves the introduction of politicization mechanisms. Politicization comes in a variety of forms, and the article develops a typology covering formal, functional and administrative politicization. Further it empirically demonstrates how politicization mechanisms not only increase, but how they develop and interact, altering balances of neutrality and responsiveness in potentially conflicting ways.

ID ECONOMICS; SERVICE
AB This article explores the influence of two types of signalling on the career success of civil servants in the federal ministerial bureaucracy of Germany. Whereas ability signalling' displays bureaucratic expertise in the sense of both political craft and administrative management competencies, intention signalling' indicates party politicization. Data are drawn from the biographies of 341 civil servants within the two highest ranks in federal ministries and the chancellery who held office between 2002 and 2013. Taking gender, formal education and career patterns into consideration, we are able to find clear evidence for intention signalling', whereas ability signalling' plays only a minor role. Over time, the accelerating effect of intention signalling' on administrative careers is increasing. Points for practitioners How important is political loyalty for senior civil servants in merit bureaucracies? This article investigates the relationship between the merit principle and politicization in the German federal bureaucracy. By analysing the importance of certain career steps, we find clear evidence for party politicization. Employment in positions that signal party political loyalty accelerates the careers of ministerial officials, even if the data also prove that there is no distinct fast track' to leading administrative positions in Germany. Moreover, our analysis reveals an under-representation of women in administrative top positions, as well as the continuing dominance of lawyers. Regarding career patterns, considerable differences between state secretaries and directors-general are evident.

AB This contribution seeks to answer the question whether the new civil service legislation that entered into force in 2015 in the Czech Republic led to the depoliticization of the country's ministerial bureaucracy. To that end, we compare the career backgrounds of top civil servants before and after the entry into force of the new Civil Service Act. The article examines the career backgrounds of the persons appointed as ministerial deputies between 2013 and 2018, focusing on their last "pre-deputy" jobs and considering a broader set of their career attributes. A focus on the previous job reveals that even before the law was introduced, bureaucrats constituted the largest share of appointees, and their share even increased with the new legislation. The incidence of deputies appointed directly from party-related jobs dropped considerably. However, when a broader set of career attributes is considered, the share of partisans among the pre-2015 deputies nearly matches that of the career bureaucrats. Ostensibly political careers among the post-2015 deputies declined but remain significant. Hence, there has been a decline in the open politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy after 2015. Party political effects also matter, as the new ANO party, after entering the executive, has taken a different approach to top bureaucratic appointments than the other major governing Czech parties. Typically, deputies appointed into the positions under the ANO's control would not have links to the party itself but would be recruited via non-party channels, e.g. from pre-political networks of the ANO ministers and leaders. Consequently, though less politicized by party agents, the current Czech system is more a product of choices made by government ministers of the day than a stable arrangement resulting from firmly established norms and rules.

AB The paper provides an analysis of the impacts of the reform initiatives in the civil service have had to the country's administration. It shows how and to what extent the values of management-based reforms have been impacted on the government machinery and in particular, the senior civil servants in particular. The paper used the combination of descriptive and analytical methods of which data were obtained from both secondary sources and primary source of interviews. Despite the fact that Malaysia has kept itself abreast with the global trend through the introduction of the public management-oriented administration, evidences have shown that the implementation is far from being satisfactory. The paper argues that the implementation of managerial reforms have blurred the political-administrative interface which has subsequently led to politicization. As such, the paper attempts to enrich the limited knowledge by analyzing some opinions from the senior management figures i.e. Director Generals (DGs). Study on the impacts of the reforms towards the senior civil servants is relatively new in Malaysia and hence, the scarcity of respective literatures. The findings of the paper are very significant for all researchers in similar areas, even more so for policy makers and the civil servants.

ID WESTMINSTER; ADVISERS
AB In the context of the civil service system reform, the new normative framework adopted in 2002 introduced a new management arrangement in public administration, whose consequence was the transition of senior positions within ministries, bodies within ministries, and government offices from political officials to positional civil servants with a limited term of office, who have thus become the most senior civil servants, called administrative managers. Based on extensive empirical research and statistical data, this article provides an in-depth analysis of the status and position of administrative managers, which is intended to serve as a test whether the apex of the Slovenian administrative system is politicized and in what form. In the so-called new democracies, politicization most often is manifested as a violation of the principles of political neutrality characteristic of a professional civil service, through personalized and biased appointments of senior civil servants and in the low degree of protection against lay-offs of civil servants on political grounds. Administrative managers thus often have to decide between political susceptibility and trustworthiness versus professionalism and professional accountability, for their tasks belong to the administrative and political realms. This poses a question about the degree of influence politicians exert on administrative managers and the rate of success with which administrative managers manage to retain their professionalism and independence, which should represent the key characteristics of a senior civil servant.

AB Against a background of institutional change and organizational reform, we analyze the politicization of the European Commission's bureaucracy. Politicization can generally be defined as the substitution of bureaucratic neutrality by introducing political considerations into the human resource management and behaviour of civil servants. The concepts of direct and professional politicization serve as vantage points for our analysis. The empirical data are taken from documentary analysis and recent online and semi-structured surveys of Commission officials. We show that Commission bureaucrats, although they are highly sensitive to the political side of their job, are less politicized since the Kinnock reforms than before. While the College of the Commission seems to have indeed become more politically responsive to its supranational peers and national governments, the Commission's bureaucracy can be characterized as weakly politicized or, according to current debates, as quite instrumental in a Neo-Weberian sense.

ID POLITICAL RESPONSIVENESS; NEUTRAL COMPETENCE; POLICY
AB Politicization has an ambivalent reputation among public administration scholars. While considered an effective instrument to safeguard political control over ministerial bureaucracy, partisanship of senior civil servants is likewise associated with patronage and is deemed detrimental to professionalism and meritocracy. To scrutinize this contradiction, the article examines how the party-political background of senior civil servants influences their decision-making behaviour. Two theoretically derived conceptions of loyalty are therefore put to the test: responsiveness and responsibility. Effects are captured by using the vignette technique in 40 in-depth interviews with former senior civil servants from ministerial departments at federal and state level in Germany. The results are surprising in so far as they reveal that politicized senior civil servants act neither more responsively nor less responsibly than their non-politicized peers. These findings challenge common assumptions and call for a more refined analysis of the conditions under which politicization leads to negative effects.

AB This paper compares and contrasts the behavioral tendencies between civil servants recruited from regular entrance examinations (REEs) and specially selected graduates (SSGs) in grassroots-level governments in China as they face a conflict between vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (public) responsiveness. This study draws on a survey from 13 cities to explore behavioral variations in the two categories of civil servants. Two test methods (the OLS and mediation model) are adopted to verify the findings. This study finds that both the vertical and horizontal responsiveness of civil servants who are SSGs tend to be higher than those recruited from the REEs in facing the above-mentioned conflict. Four personnel mechanisms are tested to explain this variation: (1) the politicized recruitment and selection of SSGs, (2) job arrangements for SSGs, (3) triple leadership over SSGs, and (4) a fast-track stream for SSGs. Our analysis reveals that only the first two can account for this variation. This account can shed new light on the impact of the development of a separate corps of elites in China.

AB This paper explores four potential motivations for the party politicization of the senior civil service: ideological agreement, coalition governance, party family issue priorities, and consociational representation. Using data on the party affiliation of 134 secretaries-general (SGs) serving in the Dutch ministerial bureaucracy between 1945 and 2013, it examines the partisan logic of appointment patterns among senior civil servants in the Netherlands. Overall levels of politicization are very high (almost 70 percent of all SGs have a discernible party affiliation), with a strong increase between 1970 and 1990 and a slight drop-off during the past decades. The appointment patterns suggest that the main drivers behind the party politicization of the Dutch elite bureaucracy are the demand for ideological agreement and a consociational quest for the representation of the 'pillar parties' in the senior civil service.

AB Although substantial advances have been made in our comprehension of functional politicization - political capacities and activities being taken on by bureaucrats in their administrative duties - questions surrounding its causal mechanisms remain. To shed light on these questions, we here explore increasing political polarization (and fragmentation) in Dutch politics and functional politicization over the period 2007-2019 to see how the two are related. To do so, we adopt a cross-time approach that observes which skills - political-strategic insight, substantive expertise (Fachwissen), or procedural knowledge (Dienstwissen) - senior civil servants perceive to be the most relevant to successfully and correctly exercise their profession in a period of increasing polarization in the Dutch political landscape. Drawing from surveys conducted with senior civil servants in 2007, 2013 and 2019, combined with semi-structured interviews conducted in 2019, the data depicts the prevalence of political astuteness in the profession and highlights the factors for its causes: institutional, organizational, and interpersonal dynamics. This indicates an (in)direct link between political polarization and functional politicization of the administrative apparatus that serves as a basis for further cross-time and cross-country investigation.

AB This article of top civil servants in Danish central and local government sheds new light on politicization. A survival analysis shows that since 1970, the risk that a top civil servant will be replaced has increased. There is no evidence of politicization in central government while city managers' risk of replacement increases both when a new mayor, representing another party and holding an absolute majority, and when the shift of mayor takes place within the same party. We interpret these results as evidence of the adaptability of the merit civil service and political executives' stronger insistence on their authority to make discretionary replacements.

AB The politicization of bureaucracy, which indicates one of the most significant aspects of politics-bureaucracy relations, had been at the center of studies leading to the establishment of Public Administration Discipline, and has always maintained its importance and popularity as a subject matter since the beginning of the 20th century. Though it was used as a synonym of partisanship by Classical Approach, the politicization of bureaucracy, by virtue of Bureaucratic Politics Approach and Principle-Agent Approach that shed light on the different aspects of the politics-bureaucracy relations, gained two new meanings by the 1980s. While first meaning underlines harmony and complementarity between politics-bureaucracy, the second points a responsive and competent bureaucracy. Such a case, as it indicates one single signifier for three signifieds from the point of semiotics, has prevented us to demarcate an obvious distinction between different meanings of the concept. In order to ease analyzing and comprehending, this study, which aims to present three different meanings of the politicization of bureaucracy, claims that these different meanings can be examined via three types of antonyms in linguistics. While first meaning is related with complimentary antonym, second and third are matched with relational antonym and graded antonym respectively.

DE Administrative tradition; bureaucracy; politicization; quality of

AB It is frequently claimed within the politicization literature that while governments around the world are increasingly politicizing senior public service appointments, the nature and extent of this politicization varies across administrative traditions. To date, however, differences across administrative traditions have received little empirical scrutiny; research tends to be more comparable than comparative. Using data from an expert survey systematically measuring the merit-, political-, and personal-recruitment of senior public servants in 20 countries, this article examines differences across and within the Nordic, Westminster, Germanic and Napoleonic administrative traditions, in addition to the alternative Anglo-American and Southern European traditions. Various tests show meaningful variation in politicization across administrative traditions, with the starkest differences found between the Nordic and Napoleonic traditions. The results also show less variation among the countries comprising the Nordic tradition than that found within the other traditions.

AB The aim of this study is to contribute to the construction of a theoretical framework for the subject of public bureaucracy as a political elite in Chile. Through an analysis of their political status and political roles, this research explores the mechanisms used by medium-high level bureaucrats to exert influence in the formulation of public policies. This article analyzes the public management modernization policy (1990-2014). The analysis of interviews with 78 different actors of this policy makes it possible to see the influence middle-level bureaucrats have thanks to their special type of expertise (public policy expertise) that has to do with the career structure, the high level of politicization of Chilean bureaucracy and the type of tasks that are carried out, which would conform a sort of special capital of bureaucrats: the bureaucratic capital.

DE American politics; bureaucracy; president; politicization
ID OVERSIGHT
AB Scholarship on bureaucratic responsiveness to Congress typically focuses on delegation and formal oversight hearings. Overlooked are daily requests to executive agencies made by legislators that propose policies, communicate concerns, and request information or services. Analyzing over 24,000 of these requests made to 13 executive agencies between 2007 and 2014, I find agencies systematically prioritize the policy-related requests of majority party legislators-but that this effect can be counteracted when presidents politicize agencies through appointments. An increase in politicization produces a favorable agency bias toward presidential copartisans. This same politicization, however, has a net negative impact on agency responsiveness-agencies are less responsive to members of Congress, but even less responsive to legislators who are not presidential copartisans. Critically, this negative impact extends beyond policy-related requests to cases of constituency service. The results suggest that presidential appointees play an important, daily mediating role between Congress and the bureaucracy.

AB This article discusses the emergence of political subjectivity and politicization among social workers and teachers. We present situations that have induced teachers and social workers to become politically active and examine what their struggle might imply for these unaccompanied children. We also ask how the nation state is interpellated and transformed. Drawing on Laclau, Mouffe and Biesta, we find that political subjectivity emerges in situations with conflicting norms and contradictory interpellations. When Sweden deported unaccompanied refugee children, numerous social workers and teachers found themselves torn between acting as loyal civil servants or acting in accordance with their professional ethics. When representatives from this category emerge as political subjects directed at political change, the nation state becomes unstable and porous, creating possibilities for change.

AB How are civil servants and politically appointed advisers likely to respond to policy proposals that they believe will harm their countries severely even if they are legal? Based on the different loyalties and roles of political advisors (PA) and civil servants (CS), we hypothesise that (1) PAs are more likely to voice internally, (2) CSs are more likely to voice externally and (3) CSs in functionally politicised systems are more likely to stay silent. These hypotheses are tested on - and partially supported by - data collected through two surveys directed to the ministerial staffs in Denmark and Sweden. PAs are more likely to voice internally, but none of the two groups is particularly keen to voice externally. The propensity to voice concerns in case of perceived harmful policy proposals depends on the kind as well as the level of politicisation.

ID BUREAUCRATIC AUTONOMY; STATE; MANAGEMENT
AB Public sector reforms aimed at 'making the managers manage' granted public managers autonomy and tried to depoliticize the administration. There is substantial variation in the degree of direct politicization and in managerial autonomy. This article tests four sets of hypotheses to explain variation in perceptions of direct politicization and managerial autonomy in European public sectors. Data from a new survey in 15 countries among several thousand top public sector managers in central government are used. Findings show that variation in perceived direct politicization and managerial autonomy is partially determined by the formal status of an organization as an agency, and the hierarchical position of the manager within the organization. Managers from very large organizations also experience more autonomy, but organization size has no impact on perceived politicization. The policy field within which the respondent's organization is situated has mixed effects. The article also finds that the models are better at explaining the variation in perceived managerial autonomy than that in direct politicization. Points for practitioners The article shows that top public managers in European central administration perceive different levels in the extent to which politicians try to influence senior-level appointments, as well as in the extent of management autonomy that they have. These differences in perception are mainly explained by whether or not they work in an agency, as well as by the hierarchical position that they occupy within the organization.

AB Explanations of politicization tend to focus on historical trends, administrative traditions, and government preferences. Absent from this literature are the actions of bureaucrats themselves. Drawing on theories of employee resistance from organization studies suggesting that changes threatening the financial security and professional identity of employees may be resisted, this article explores whether bureaucrats resist, and seek to deter, efforts of politicization. Through a most likely case study design of New Brunswick (Canada), this article finds that bureaucrats not only resisted efforts of politicization but that such actions also deterred the government from making any further dismissals.

AB Research on bureaucracy and corruption tends to concentrate on cross-national research taking countries as the unit of analysis. Yet national-level measures neglect large differences within countries. This article therefore takes the perspective of individual bureaucrats. It studies how public officials' experience with bureaucratic institutions affects corruption within their sphere of work. Based on a survey of central government officials in five post-communist states, the article examines how public servants' views on civil service laws, the quality of their implementation, merit recruitment, and the politicization of appointments associate with rumours of kickbacks in their place of work. The analysis shows that merit recruitment is associated with less corruption, while politicization is associated with more corruption. In contrast, civil service laws are negatively associated with corruption only if they are properly implemented. The findings complement and qualify country-level research, approaching more closely the micro-foundations of the relation between bureaucracy and corruption.

AB One of the strands in the growing scholarship on political advisers in parliamentary democracies proposes that advisers can reduce the risk of civil service politicization by furnishing partisan advice to ministers, freeing civil servants to focus on the provision of expert competence. This benign narrative generates a significant hypothesis, which is that the institutionalization of the partisan role diminishes the risk of civil service politicization. That hypothesis has yet to be fully tested. Several studies have assessed the impact of advisers' actions on civil service impartiality, but the consequences of bureaucrats' own agency for that dependent variable have received far less attention. Drawing on data from a survey of New Zealand public servants, this article challenges the assumption in the political advisers literature that civil service politicization is primarily driven by exogenous factors and calls for a more nuanced theoretical approach to endogenous aspects of politicization.

ID POSTCOMMUNIST STATE
AB Politicization of top civil service in Central and Eastern Europe has been discussed among both academics and practitioners for some time now. It has been concluded that the politicization of civil servants has resurged since the accession into the EU, which has lead to a great deal of uncertainty among civil service. Nevertheless, the evidence on turnover is mostly stemming from interviews and expert survey since CEE countries lack basic data on HR functions. This paper wants to address this gap and looks into turnover data (both scope and depth) among top civil service officials at the six Slovak ministries between 2004 and 2014. During this period, the Slovak government was completely changed three times. The work describes the connection between electoral cycles and top civil servants replacements. The research has shown that election cycles are important determinant for the replacements. Nevertheless, not only electoral cycles are important in the turnover. The paper has shown that the role of minister personality has an impact on replacements and turnover rates. Also, the research has shown the existence of "stable units" within otherwise politicized ministry where the top civil servants change only on a minimal level.

AB The study focuses on the role of policy advice brokers - political advisors - pertaining to the issue of politicization in the European Commission (EC). The study conceptualizes politicization as increased use of political advisors - known as "cabinets" in the EC context - by the Commissioners to ensure political direction over the work of the civil service. Commissioners' private cabinets fulfil several functions, one of which is political steering of the policy work in the departments. The study argues that as a result of the NPM-style reform and strengthening of the civil service accountability to the political level, the political steering function of the cabinet advisors grew in importance. To examine whether the political steering function of cabinets became more important after the reform, the study analyzed the lists of cabinets' responsibilities available online from the Prodi to the Junker Commissions. The content of the lists of responsibilities was first coded and then statistically analyzed testing for the effect of the reform on the structure of cabinets' responsibilities.

AB The interaction between political executives and civil servants rests on a delicate balance between political responsiveness and the duty of civil servants and ministers to respect legal and other normative constraints on executive authority. In Danish central government, this balance is stressed by norms that define the correct behavior when the civil service provides ministers with political advice and assistance. Organizational factors strongly influence civil servants' behavior when they have to balance responsiveness against constraints on their role as political advisers. Moreover, civil servants working closely with ministers pay more attention to legal constraints than their peers among agency officials and specialists. Agency officials and specialists are much more prone to prioritize professional standards. We argue that this pattern can be generalized West European systems.

ID IDEOLOGY
AB Federal civil servants need policy expertise to formulate and implement public policy. Presidents and congresses do not confer such expertise when they delegate responsibility for policy making. Existing research suggests that elected officials' efforts to gain control of federal agencies can reduce agency expertise by inducing civil servants to exit the agency and reducing incentives for civil servants to exert effort, including acquiring policy expertise. I use data from an original survey of federal executives to examine whether politicization reduces agency expertise. I find that civil servants whose policy preferences diverge from those of political appointees are more likely to perceive that their agency is politicized and that civil servants who perceive their agency is politicized are more likely to exit the agency and less likely to engage in behaviors that build policy expertise. In total, these findings provide systematic, microlevel evidence demonstrating how politicization can reduce agency policy expertise.

AB Scholars traditionally frame presidential efforts to politicize the federal bureaucracy as the result of divergence between the president's preferences and an agency's output. The authors argue that presidential concern with agency output is dynamic and is in part conditioned by the president's relationship with the public. To assess the relationship between politicization and public opinion, the authors use a data set that combines information on presidential efforts to politicize the Council of Economic Advisers from 1989 to 2004 with that of public attitudes concerning the president's handling of the economy. Their results indicate that public opinion does indeed bear a marginal, yet statistically significant, influence on presidential efforts to manage the federal bureaucracy, thus, providing a new contribution to the debate concerning presidents and the politics of bureaucratic structure.

SO REVISTA DO SERVICO PUBLICO

DT Article
DE bureaucracy; high-level bureaucracy; personnel selection; legitimacy
AB Performance and legitimacy are classic themes within the literature of public bureaucracy. However, much of the academic studies on the subject in Latin America is still based on conceptual frameworks related to the functioning of the bureaucracy in the authoritarian periods. In recent decades, the democratic experience in the region has been consolidating and represents a rich opportunity for new studies, especially those that seek to go beyond the analysis of a single national government. Thus, this paper proposes, based on the analysis of both Chilean and Brazilian empirical cases, to study two different models of Senior Civil Service composition, among many existing types, through the case studies of Altos Directivos Publicos, in Chile, and Especialistas em Politicas Publicas e Gestao Governamental, in Brazil. The analytical dimensions adopted are performance and legitimacy and the thesis presented as a synthesis of the essay is the technification of politics in Chile, and the politicization of bureaucracy in Brazil, both treated from a historical perspective. The adopted methodological approach is based on the exploratory qualitative method, operationalized by literature review, documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with bureaucrats.

DE Bureaucracy; policy; good governance; administration; Democracy
AB The study investigated the roles of bureaucracy in Nigeria and its inadequacies in adhering to the Weberian model of policy implementation in the Nigeria democratic governance. The study adopted a survey research design and utilized primary data obtained through the administration of questionnaires to a purposively selected 220 respondents comprising senior bureaucrats and CSOs, and conduct of the in-depth interview. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis with the aid of SPSS. The study revealed that even though, bureaucrats are not necessarily the primary makers of the policy. They play an active role in policy implementation in Nigeria. However, factors such as political pressure, inadequate budgetary allocation, over politicization of the appointment into governmental offices leading to inadequate professionalism, and environmental variables hinder the effective implementation of policy in Nigeria. It was equally established that as ideal as the Weberian model of bureaucracy is, there are inevitable lacuna and inadequacies in its application to Nigeria, due to factors such as socio-cultural forces, collectivism as against individualism, and absolute formalism. The study concluded that, although Weberian bureaucracy could be ideal and applicable to large-scale economy, its model is inadequate in addressing all the needs and circumstances of Nigeria. Hence, the need to restructure or readjust the bureaucracy to adapt to new and complex problems becomes apparent.

The analysis of the phenomenon of politicization has allowed the identification of three stages: 2000-2004, 2005-2008, 2009-present. Enforcement of the legislation regarding civil service enabled a considerable increase in stability at this level but there is still a dependence of the public function on the political system through legislative changes.

DE Public Administration; Romanian civil service reform; The politicization
   of civil service
AB The recent developments at economic, social, and political level have only shown the obvious need of reform which is reflected in all Romanian areas, including in the public administration sector. This is because the public administration as part of the state is submitted to a transformation process as a result of the influences exerted by various factors such as: the politicization, European integration, decentralization, each of these factors has effects at local and national level. The politicization of public administration prevents the reform process of civil service, having negative repercussions on public administration activity, considering that through the civil servants there are represented and managed the interests of local, regional and national communities. Removing politics from the administration will allow officials to perform their job duties in good faith and it will increase their orientation towards the needs of citizens, as the public administration has to serve the general interest and not the interests of different parties that have the power at a certain time. Even if there is a link between politics and administration, it must be strictly limited to a certain level and not covering the whole body of civil servants.

AB The influence of senior civil servants' (SCS) tasks on their role perceptions has been widely ignored in the past research on the administrative elite. This paper presents new survey data on SCS in German federal ministries to test this relation by categorizing SCS into three task-related groups: strategists, policy specialists and administrators. Regression analyses reveal that SCS's tasks do not influence their (strong) identification with reactive (supportive) roles but have a significant impact on their identification with active, more politically entrepreneurial roles. This entails two important findings: First, SCS's tasks matter for their appreciation of different roles. Second, active and reactive role models are not irreconcilable (as it is often argued in the literature on bureaucratic politicization), but complementary.

DE appointment; civil service; dismissal; Kosovo; law; politicization;

AB This contribution discusses the politicization of the civil service system in Kosovo as a framework through which politicians exert influence in the system. The article employs the concept of formal-political discretion, as a means of explaining and elucidating the extent to which both the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and current legislation regulating civil service preconditions/pre-favours the politicization of the senior civil service in Kosovo. It first discusses the concept of politicization based upon current scholarship and gives hints on the way in which these concepts fit with both UNMIK and Kosovo's current situation. Next, the article discusses and compares the previous civil service system built by UNMIK with the current one - built in post-independence Kosovo based upon the formal-political discretion model. The article further argues that the former system of civil service - in contrast to the current system - provided less formal-political discretion to political elites with which to politicize the senior civil service. The article concludes by suggesting that the current post-independence legislation regulating the civil service grants the executive institutions a significant level of formal-political discretion in the appointment, dismissal and promotion of civil servants.

AB There is limited empirical research on the extent to which politicized recruitment of ministerial advisers affects the quality of the policy process. In this article we take a novel step by looking at two possible consequences of increased political recruitment for the policy process: administrative politicization and contestability. We deploy a Most Similar Systems comparison of Denmark and Sweden and include survey answers from 657 civil servants in managerial positions. We find that political recruitment of top civil servants, such as Swedish state secretaries, restricts the access of the civil service to the minister, but it does not substantially politicize the policy process. Danish civil servants perceive themselves as more contested by the relatively few Danish political advisers than their Swedish colleagues. Our results imply that the organization of political advice is a crucial factor for politicization and contestability

AB Why do some bureaucrats engage in corruption for personal gain, yet others for political gain? We show that these forms of corruption frequently do not coincide and offer an explanation: bureaucrats hired based on political and personal connections have different identities and incentives which compel them to engage in corruption for political and personal gain respectively. List experiments with a unique sample of 6400 bureaucrats in five countries in Africa and Asia support our argument. As theoretically expected, effects are strongest for bureaucrats whose political patrons remain in power (for corruption for political gain) and who do not need corruption gains to sustain their households (for corruption for personal gain). We also find that personal connections matter more than political connections for bureaucratic recruitment across surveyed countries. Our findings underscore the importance of studying varieties of bureaucratic corruption and of supplementing the politicization literature with studies of personal connections in bureaucracy.

AB The politicization of the European Union has elicited a variety of views on the European polity. Public scepticism is often directed at the European Commission which is accused of being an unresponsive and illegitimate bureaucracy. How does politicization affect the institutional role conceptions of Commission officials? By building on the literature of politicization and norm-guided open system approaches, I develop theoretical propositions on how politicization may affect the institutional role conceptions of Commission officials. Grounded on the proposition that Commission officials are most likely to respond to politicization in their home country, an exploratory case study of Dutch officials (21 in-depth interviews) was performed to flesh out the mechanisms at play. The findings tentatively reveal that, in varying degrees, most officials respond to politicization by adapting their institutional role conception into a more pragmatic direction, in which subsidiarity or legitimacy concerns are central.

AB This article is an overview of shifting political-administrative relationships in South Africa, with particular reference to growing politicization (partisan control of the bureaucracy). Studies of politicization of public services are important because political involvement in management has often led to negative effects on service delivery. The article sets out a theoretical framework for political-administrative relationships, examining the growing politicization of public services, the impact of New Public Management (NPM) and political-administrative relationships in developing countries. It then looks at political-administrative relationships in South Africa, including the apartheid history, the development of a new framework in the democratic South Africa and politicization in the staffing of the public service. It examines three functional areas - the decentralization of powers, contract appointments and performance management - and discusses the implications of this changing framework for service delivery. The methodology consisted of interviews with a number of senior government officials, including three current directors-general and a former Minister for the Public Service and Administration, an analysis of government legislation, Public Service Commission (PSC) data including surveys, unpublished data of the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA), policy papers of the African National Congress (ANC) and an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study of political involvement in bureaucracies. The article concludes that growing politicization of the public service has contributed to poor service delivery, and that the South African government needs to place greater emphasis on merit as the basis for appointments and promotions.

AB Understanding representation is central to politics. Numerous studies assess under which conditions politicians share citizens' ideological preferences. However, under which conditions bureaucrats share citizens' ideological preferences has not been systematically studied. Yet, bureaucratic preferences shape policy outcomes. Our paper thus studies why bureaucrats are more right or left-wing than citizens in some countries and points of time, yet not others. We theorize that political ideologies of past incumbents shape this variation. Incumbents can select ideologically aligned bureaucrats and socialize bureaucrats into ideological preferences; moreover, prospective bureaucrats may self-select into ideologically aligned governments. As bureaucratic tenure exceeds political tenure, this politicization has lasting effects. Survey data from 87 countries supports this argument: bureaucrats are more left-leaning than citizens in countries with longer prior rule by economically left-wing governments, and more right-wing in countries with more authoritarian pasts. This suggests that incumbents continue to shape the ideological preferences of bureaucrats after leaving office.

It focuses on the practical work of the civil servants at the Ministry of Ecology responsible for setting the orientations of the reform, transcribing them into legal provisions and ensuring that they would be supported and passed in Parliament. The analysis approaches the task by tracking both the successive versions of the bill and the multiple documents used in the preparation of these versions.

AB Parliamentary processing of European Union (EU) matters in Finland has been characterized as consensual and pragmatic, with little if any public conflict between the political parties. The main goal is understood to be to achieve parliamentary unity or at least broad consensus, which can arguably be translated into additional influence in EU-level bargaining. But the outbreak of the euro crisis and the 2011 Eduskunta elections triggered a major domestic politicization of Europe, which also affected parliamentary behaviour. EU issues are now debated more often in the full chamber, while voting has become more common in the EAC, with the losing opposition minority adding its dissenting opinions to the EU reports of the committees. Drawing on Eduskunta records and interviews with members of parliament (MPs) and civil servants, three hypotheses about the driving force behind this politicization are formulated: conflicting logics of appropriateness among MPs, the strategic incentives of the Finns Party, and frustration about euro crisis decision making.

AB Just like national administration, international organizations are subject to politicization and its ambivalent effects. The present article makes use of relevant contributions to the theory of formal organizations and bureaucracy in an attempt to conceptualize the politicization phenomenon. A case of norm emergence and norm implementation within the system of the United Nations is analyzed, the principle of a Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and the phases of its constructive and obstructive politicization. The argument is that the impact of politicization increases when internal and external politicization impulses coincide and that strategic communication of policy entrepreneurs may decisively influence the constructive or obstructive character of politicization.

SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY; CRISES
AB When things in the public domain go wrong, government bureaucracies usually face increased political scrutiny and strong demands for reform. The need for organizational learning is high under such circumstances. Conventional theories, however, conceive political involvement as a constraint on organizational learning. This implies a paradoxical challenge for public organizations. On the one hand, the need to learn from mistakes is highest in times of political scrutiny; on the other hand, under such conditions learning is presumed to be most difficult. After studying the effects of politicization on organizational learning in detail, we come to the conclusion that this notion is incomplete at best. Learning in public organizations depends not so much on political involvement as such but, rather, on the specific characteristics of that involvement. Politicians may influence learning processes positively if they commit to structural solutions and encourage the institutionalization of organizational lessons.

AB This article contributes to the literature on the politicization of appointments to increase political control over public bureaucracies with often substantial managerial and policy autonomy. Using data from a large-scale executive survey from central government ministries and agencies in 18 European countries, the article provides a comprehensive cross-national and cross-organizational analysis of the autonomy-politicization conundrum and the drivers of the politicization of senior-level appointments. We find that national patterns of politicization correspond fairly well to country families as defined by administrative traditions, with some traditions being more coherent than others. At the organizational level, we find no evidence of efforts by politicians to compensate for extended autonomy by politicizing senior-level appointments, yet we provide evidence of differential effects of both formal and informal organizational characteristics on patterns of politicization. Our analyses show that politicization of senior appointments is lower in organizations with agency status, higher organizational social capital, higher financial autonomy and more extensive use of management tools. The article thereby not only offers comprehensive evidence of cross-country differences in politicization; it also adds to the literature on sub-national variation, by fleshing out an organizational perspective to the study of politicized appointments in the European context.

AB Accurate knowledge about societal conditions and public policies is an important public good in any polity, yet governments across the world differ dramatically in the extent to which they collect and publish such knowledge. This article develops and tests the argument that this variation to some extent can be traced to the degree of bureaucratic politicization in a polity. A politicized bureaucracy offers politicians greater opportunities to demand from bureaucratsand raises incentives for bureaucrats to supplypublic policy knowledge that is strategically biased or suppressed in a manner that benefits incumbents reputationally. Due to electoral competition, we suggest that the link between bureaucratic politicization and politicized policy knowledge will be stronger in democracies than in autocracies. A case analysis of Argentina's statistical agency lends credence to the underlying causal mechanism. Time-series cross-sectional analyses confirm the broader validity of the expectations and show that the relationship is present only in democracies.

AB Scholarly work in the 1990s indicated that the values of civil servants in late colonial Hong Kong were evolving from those of classical bureaucrats to those of more political bureaucrats as the political and social environment changed. Based on in-depth interviews with 58 politicians and senior civil servants carried out between 2009 and 2012, we argue that Hong Kong civil service values have adapted owing in part to external shocks such as regime change and governance reform. Still, traditional civil service values such as fiscal prudence and balancing various community interests continue to be prominent. We illustrate the influence of civil service values in two policymaking cases: small-class teaching and minimum-wage legislation.

AB Ministerial advisers are said to strengthen the political control of bureaucracy. Using a comparative case design, this article investigates this claim by studying the roles of ministerial advisers in government coordination in Denmark and Sweden. The article demonstrates how the roles of advisers differ in coordination: Swedish advisers directly control government coordination through hierarchical authority. The roles of advisers and bureaucrats are functionally differentiated in coordination. In contrast, Danish advisers play a more indirect role in coordination. Rather than controlling coordination, they serve to reproduce the functional politicization of the permanent bureaucracy in government coordination. The findings underline the relevance of including advisers in the future study of government coordination. The analysis is based on 48 interviews with advisers and top civil servants in Denmark and Sweden.

TI 'Without Affection or Enthusiasm' problems of involvement and attachment
   in 'Responsive' public management
SO ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
DE bureaucracy; enthusiasm; ethics; office; politicization; responsiveness
AB The paper focuses on the changing ethical template that programmes of 'responsive' or 'entrepreneurial' managerial reform require of civil servants. Contemporary demands for responsive public management contain two emotional injunctions to public bureaucrats. The first, derived from populist doctrines of political right, requires bureaucrats to be responsive to the needs of their 'clients'. In the name of 'recognition' and the 'politics of care', for example, it is thought vital to inculcate in bureaucratic conduct a sense of 'compassion' or close identification with others' feelings. Secondly, in the name of responsiveness to political superiors and the delivery of their policy objectives, bureaucrats are expected to exhibit 'ownership' of and identification with particular policies. They are required to be committed champions for and enthusiastic advocates of those policies. Both of these injunctions are deemed to be more in tune with democratic principles and the currents of contemporary ethical culture ('diversity' or 'human rights', for example) than what is represented as the unlamented Weberian world of rule-bound hierarchy. The paper seeks to question this assessment.

SO PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Politicization; political appointees; government performance; civil
   service; bureaucracy
AB This essay looks at where the line is drawn between political appointees and careerists in the Philippine government and its effects on agency performance. Using the period 1986 to 2010 as a case study, the study unpacks the Philippine civil service to reveal the location and scale of political appointees in the bureaucracy, describes common techniques used by presidents to increase the number and penetration of appointees, and provides a quantitative evaluation of effects. Of specific interest is the thesis from Lewis that while political appointees in the bureaucracy can be a short term strategy for improving performance, the long term consequences are pernicious even when appointees are of consistently high quality. The available data permits only the simplest of regressions but results indicate that political appointees may indeed help in the short term but ultimately cause harm in the longer run.

AB Civil service organizations in the developing world often lack women and minorities in leadership positions. This has important consequences for the quality of public goods provision and the perceived trustworthiness of bureaucrats. We explore the effect of democratization on the discrimination of women and minorities in the civil service. We argue democratization leads to increased discrimination due to the politicization of identity cleavages. We test our argument using administrative data from Indonesia that cover the career histories of more than four million active civil servants. We exploit the exogenous timing of Indonesia's democratization and the staggered introduction of local direct elections for identification purposes. We find strong evidence that democratizationworsenedthe career prospects of female and some religious minority bureaucrats. Penalties are higher for employees of departments led by conservative Muslim parties, in districts with larger Muslim party vote shares or larger Muslim populations, and in the religiously conservative province of Aceh.

ID MINISTERIAL ADVISERS; SERVICE; GOVERNMENT; REFORM; POLICY
AB In recent times much has been made of the threat some argue is posed by political advisers to the impartiality of the Westminster civil service. Drawing on survey of senior New Zealand civil servants, this article examines the degree to which political advisers are perceived as a threat to civil service neutrality and describes the form taken by that threat as variously perceived. On the evidence reported, it is suggested that traditional understandings of "politicization" need to be reconceptualized if they are to fully account for the nature of the relationship between political and civil service advisers. To existing conceptions of politicization, therefore, the article proposes adding another: "administrative politicization," allowing for different gradations of politicization to be identified, and enabling a nuanced assessment of the nature and extent of a risk to civil service neutrality that, the data suggest, is not as great as is sometimes alleged.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the politicization of senior civil service (SCS) in Korea from a human resource perspective. To be specific, it is to explore how much the SCS has been politicized after its inception in 2006 and to discover what has strengthened it.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper employs the human resource management perspective with five stages, selection, rotation, education, promotion and compensation, which are related with different weights to four causes of politicization: political desire to control, leadership change, public demands and political interest.
   Findings This paper argues that politicization of SCS in Korea has gradually increased during the last 10 years. It also found that, while selection and promotion is strongly politicized, education and compensation is weakly politicized.
   Originality/value This paper mainly draws increasing politicization after it was introduced. Little prior literature has explored the politicization of SCS in human resource management processes and its causes for Korea.

AB IMPACT Those policy-makers and practitioners who have contact with civil servants and government ministers need to better understand the more fluid and unpredictable policy environment that is emerging at various tiers of UK governance, shaped by a multiplicity of actors sitting within, and outside, the formal boundaries of the state. The diverse ecology of policy-making institutions includes think-tanks, research institutes, non-governmental organizations, charities, community groups, management consultancies, and professional services companies, all of whom are involved in directly providing policy advice to ministers. The 'monopoly' over policy-making traditionally enjoyed by the civil service is eroding, with important implications for the work of policy-makers and public managers who have to negotiate the more fractious system of Whitehall bureaucracy. A subtle but perceptible shift is occurring whereby elected politicians and their advisers are gaining greater control over the policy-making processes of the UK state.
   This paper contends that since 2010 in the UK, there has been an unprecedented attempt to disrupt the traditional civil service 'monopoly' over policy advice, outsourcing policy-making to actors beyond the central state. The author argues that the policy-making processes of Whitehall and Westminster governance are being radically overhauled. In many Anglophone countries, ministers have sought to reduce their structural dependence on the permanent civil service. In so doing, ministers sought to gain political control over the machinery of policy-making. These efforts to restructure the permanent bureaucracy have had unintended consequences, however. The policy process in the UK state has become more fragmented, as policy-making and implementation have increasingly diverged.

AB This article develops a theory of bureaucratic influence on distributive politics. Although there exists a rich literature on the effects of institutions such as presidents, electoral systems, and bicameralism on government spending, the role of professional bureaucrats has yet to receive formal scrutiny. In the model, legislators bargain over the allocation of distributive benefits across districts. The legislature may either "politicize" a program by bargaining directly over pork and bypassing bureaucratic scrutiny, or "professionalize" it by letting a bureaucrat approve or reject project funding in each district according to an underlying quality standard. The model predicts that the legislature will professionalize when the expected program quality is high. However, politicization becomes more likely as the number of high-quality projects increases and under divided government. Further, more competent bureaucrats can encourage politicization if the expected program quality is low. Finally, politicized programs are larger than professionalized programs.

AB International organizations (I0) have centralized their public communication to a large extent over recent decades by undertaking a broader codification of communication tasks as well as a departmentalization of these tasks within units of IO bureaucracies. The paper provides the first systematic analysis of this important development in institutional design using a novel data set on the organization of public communication in 48 IOs between 1950 and 2015. It identifies self-legitimation as a key driver of centralization in the face of increased levels of politicization, that is, public awareness and activism directed at IOs. Empirically, the study suggests that the centralization of public communication significantly increases as transnational civil society organizes and gains access to IO decision-making. Further, politicization in terms of contentious activism and public scandals substantially accounts for varying levels of centralization across IOs.

AB Previous studies have identified institutional, organizational, and individual factors that promote innovation in public organizations. Yet they have overlooked how the type of public administration-and the type of administrators-is associated with innovative attitudes. Using two large, unique comparative data sets on public bureaucracies and public managers, this article examines how bureaucratic politicization and legalistic features are associated with senior public managers' attitudes toward innovation in 19 European countries. Results of multilevel analysis indicate that the bureaucratic politicization of an administration and the law background of public managers matter. Public managers working in politicized administrations and those whose education includes a law degree exhibit lower pro-innovation attitudes (i.e., receptiveness to new ideas and creative solutions and change orientation).

AB Many scholars lament that reforms first introduced in the late 1970s led to the demise of the Westminster administrative tradition. A recent body of research, however, has begun to question the death of the Westminster administrative tradition. This article contributes to this debate by focusing on an important tenet of this tradition: the permanency of civil servants. Using original longitudinal data of administrative heads in the UK between 1949 and 2014, this article investigates whether the relationship between several political events within the executive government and turnover of permanent secretaries has strengthened since 1979. The empirical results from cross-tabulation analysis and logistic regression suggest that over the last 60 years the relationship between political events in the executive and administrative turnover has largely remained unchanged. Since 1979, a change in the governing party, a change in the prime minister, and the re-election of a prime minister, do not lead to a greater increase in permanent secretary turnover. With the permanency of elite bureaucrats still intact, the evidence supports research suggesting that reforms since 1979 better reflect a pattern of institutional layering on top of the Westminster administrative tradition, rather than constituting its demise.

AB This article examines relationships between historical administrative systems and civil service politicization across Europe. I argue that to appreciate when and how history matters, we need to consider public service bargains struck between politicians and senior bureaucrats. Doing so complicates the relationship between historical and current administrative systems: a bureaucratic, as opposed to patrimonial, 18th-century state infrastructure is necessary for the depoliticization of ministerial bureaucracies in present-day Western Europe. However, the relationship does not hold in East-Central Europe since administrative histories are tumultuous and fractured. Combining data from across the European continent, I provide evidence in support of these propositions. Points for practitioners This article addresses policymakers dealing with reforms of personnel policy regimes at the centre of government. It considers the importance of history for politically attractive reforms, as well as the limits of this importance. I argue that 18th-century state infrastructures shape the extent to which political appointments are politically attractive tools for administrative control. I show that only in countries that feature a bureaucratic, as opposed to patrimonial, 18th-century infrastructure are ministerial top management occupied by a permanent, as opposed to politically appointed, staff. However, in East-Central Europe, a ruptured administrative history ensures that the distant past does not similarly shape the extent of political appointments.

AB Responding to recent articles in Governance highlighting the need for improved measurement of bureaucratic characteristics, this article describes efforts to map Brazil's federal agencies on three dimensions-capacity, autonomy, and partisan dominance-derived from data on more than 326,000 civil servants. The article provides a "proof of concept" about the utility of agency-level measures of these variables, demonstrating how they relate to an output common to all agencies: corruption. The article provides a first step in the direction of building a comparative research program that offers objective evaluation of bureaucracies within nation-states, with the intent of better disentangling their impact on governance outcomes.

AB Imprisonment policy has become increasingly politicized since the mid-1960s, but we do not yet know the consequence of this shift for the professional orientations of prison workers. In this article, we use original surveys of prison officers in California and Minnesota to assess whether and how partisan identification and the politicization of crime policy predict officers' conceptualizations of the purpose and function of prisons. Results show that individual partisanship is associated with officers' attitudes, but this is conditional on state context. Along with deepening understandings about the determinants of street-level bureaucrats' perspectives, this article advances knowledge about how the broader political environment might shape the attitudes of front-line workers. This is important because prison officers' perspectives affect their workplace behaviour with consequences for staff-prisoner relationships, policy implementation and the routine operations of penal facilities.

SO HEALTH RISK & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Review
DE BSE; risk; hindsight; food
AB This review essay on risk, politics and food focuses particularly on an important new insider account of how the BSE crisis was managed by one of the main civil servants involved. The management of BSE remains a decisive experience in the modern politics of risk that cautions generally against ever downplaying possible risks, and more specifically doing anything 'unnatural' with food. It led to the contemporary politicization of food and with it the insistence on only the organic, local and sustainable. What emerges from this new account is how the interpretation of the BSE experience on which current assumptions rest is very selective and laden with hindsight bias. Through revisiting BSE and the real contexts in which decisions were made, this essay raises important questions both about the politics of risk in general and the new consumer lifestyle politics of 'only natural.'

AB The extent to which new governments appoint and dismiss senior public servants is widely claimed to be influenced by their country's underlying administrative tradition. This is particularly the case within the Westminster tradition where such turnover is limited in nature, with most appointees coming from within the ranks of the public service. This article challenges the assertion that turnover in the Westminster tradition is homogeneously internal. Theorizing that new governments appoint senior public servants to increase their control over the bureaucracy, and that the desire for control is negatively correlated to trust, this article develops hypotheses between the trust new governments harbour towards the bureaucracy and whether they appoint and dismiss bureaucrats from within or outside the public service. The hypotheses are tested with longitudinal data measuring internal and external appointments and departures to the senior public service in Canada's provincial governments over a period of 18 years. The results from various multinomial regression models suggest that political appointments to the public service are not as homogenous as frequently suggested. Although a transition in the governing party and a newly elected premier from the same party of the previous government both lead to an increase in bureaucratic turnover, a newly elected first minister has a greater incidence of internal turnover than a change in party, meanwhile the level of external turnover does not meaningfully differ between these two political events.

AB Does the quality of the local bureaucracy reduce the failures in the implementation of resources of federal transfers to municipalities? This paper analyzes the process of policy implementation that makes use of federal funds, with a focus on irregularities identified in the implementation. Data from the "Programa de Sorteios Publicos" of the General Controller Office, with a random sample of Brazilian municipalities (2003-2004), are used as a measure of the quality of implementation. As the main explanatory factor four measures of quality of bureaucracy are analyzed: inadequacy, the quantitative, the qualification and absence of politicization. Using negative binomial models, the results indicate that the greater the inadequacy of the bureaucracy, the grater the number of implementation failures and irregularities in the administration of federal transfers and the greater the number of employees per capita and the proportion of employees with higher education, the lower the number of failures and irregularities in the implementation of federal funds. These results indicate the importance of the quality of the bureaucracy to explain the implementation of decentralized policies.

AB Studies have shown how women are underrepresented in senior executive positions in public and private organizations. Equal representation matters both for reasons of performance and legitimacy, and, to understand the mechanisms behind the glass ceiling, we explore if the women making it to the top of the Danish civil service differ from the men who do so. We want to understand if senior executive positions require something different of women than men. Using a dataset consisting of the entire career trajectory of all senior civil servants in Denmark, we find that, on numerous human capital dimensions, the women and men making it to the top are quite similar, for example, in terms of tenure and educational level. However, we find on the one hand that men are more often employed in the most prestigious departments and, at the same time, it seems that men with a profile deviating from the norm are more likely to make it to the top than women. This may indicate that the most prestigious positions - also in terms of early-career positions - are less accessible to women, and that women are less willing to apply for jobs outside their usual domain, or that those responsible for recruitment are less willing to take a chance on a woman with a slightly unorthodox profile. Hence, our study indicates that greater interest should be paid to the dynamics keeping women at lower levels of the hierarchy and possibly to encourage them to apply for top positions.

It highlights how the analysis of administrative careers can provide answers to pertinent questions about the relationship between politics and administration, including civil service politicization, politicians' motivations in patronage decisions, the interplay of organizational characteristics and top officials' careers, and performance effects of administrative careers. It also includes suggestions on how to move forward in terms of research methods and how the systematic analysis of administrative careers can strengthen the comparative analysis of the relationship between politics and administration.

AB The aim of the following article is to analyze how the composition of the cabinets affects the creation of centralized bureaucracies in the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil. I argue that the higher the cost of managing the coalition, the greater the likelihood of the centralization of public bodies in the Presidency. The study analyzes 172 bodies created by the Brazilian federal public administration from 1990 to 2009, with individual bodies serving as the unit of analysis. With the aim of gauging the extent to which centralization shapes the Presidency, my binary dependent variable is whether a body created within the hierarchy of the Presidency or reallocated from the ministries to the Presidency. In order to assess the effects of the degree of conflicts among the coalition's preferences on the probability of presidential centralization, four binary logistic regression models were estimated, with the degree of ideological dispersion in the cabinet; the degree of politicization in the coalition; the degree of party fractionalization in the cabinet, and the degree of ideological extremism analyzed as key factors to the study.

AB Bureaucratic performance varies immensely even within low-capacity states. Politicians and bureaucrats create pockets or networks of effectiveness that allow some departments to perform more efficiently than others. How do these networks develop and how are politicized bureaucratic appointments used to influence performance? Drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in Punjab, Pakistan, this paper argues that politicians and bureaucrats ensure enhanced performance by making legal and extra-legal appointments of hand-picked bureaucrats to key posts. The choice of bureaucrat is made on the basis of carefully curated relationships of patronage established through work, training, and old school networks. As a result, temporary networks of effectiveness are created but rendered unsustainable by the very patronage relationships that create them, preventing them from evolving into more permanent pockets of effectiveness. More broadly, my argument contributes to debates on intra-state capacity and politicization, establishing a link between patterns of staffing and patterns of governance.

AB Using an extensive case analysis of the Bhoomi system of India, this paper examines the role and nature of the state with regards to the rationale for and deployment of e-government systems. Issues such as the nature of control in governance, the discourse of de-politicization in justifying e-government and the reinvention of the state via electronic means are examined. Analysis of data collected over several years shows that e-government systems are primarily used to centralize control in the hands of the upper echelons of the bureaucracy, a strong discourse of technology and 'high modernism' permeates the justification for deploying e-government and this effectively de-politicizes the intent and purpose of the project. The paper concludes that through e-government the state reinvents itself, as the e-State, as a powerful, centralized force that disrupts historical practices and relations.

AB By drawing a division between citizens and noncitizens, migration policies speak to implicit definitions of what makes a good citizen. Commonly accepted definitions of citizenship are produced not only through explicit political discourse but also through the everyday actions of state agencies. The selection of the "worthy" migrants that those street-level bureaucracies operate is deeply rooted in interpretations of the nation's boundaries. In this article, I examine this everyday production of citizenship and nationhood by focusing on the case of Polish migration policies approached through the lens of an ethnographic study of street-level bureaucracies. While the rapid politicization of immigration in this country since 2015 resembles a major shift, an inquiry into the practices of policy implementation invites interrogations concerning continuities between past and present state practices, as well as concerning the definitions of citizens and of "worthy" immigrants that were and are prevalent within Polish institutions.

AB Media pressure on government and public administration has intensified radically in recent years. This article analyzes the behind-the-scenes processes of a strategic government pitch that aims to push the success and core values of Norwegian immigration policies in the media. The study brings attention to the complex and often conflicting demands on government officials engaged in proactive media strategies. It examines how the officials adapt to the news media logic, perceive the competition with other strategic actors, and simultaneously pay regard to the constraints inherent in a bureaucratic ethos. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork, the article illuminates how bureaucrats legitimize proactive strategies; the risks involved; and how these strategies modify the distinctive roles of political leaders and civil servants, challenging traditional bureaucratic values such as impartiality, neutrality, and loyalty.

The transition from mass repressions of cadres to the stabilization of their situation, which was already perceptible during Stalin's last years and took on a definitive turn after his death, substantially transformed the situation of Soviet regional civil servants. The progressive politicization of the nomenklatura, the conversion of nomenklaturnye rabotniki, who were fully accountable to Moscow, into an independent political force, was an important condition for the decisive events of the 1990s - the collapse of the USSR and the formation of new (in many respects old) ruling classes in Russia and in other governments of the former USSR.

AB Patronage is typically studied following government terminations when political parties appoint their nominees into the state administration. However, patronage is understudied in cases when a change of minister takes place without government termination. Taking individual government ministers as the units of analysis, we identify four modalities of ministerial alterations: replacing, successive, incumbent, and switching ministers. We show that politicization occurs under "replacing ministers" following government termination, but the bureaucratic turnover is equally high under "successive ministers." That suggests that patronage can be seen as an individualized power resource of autonomous ministers who exercise influence independently of their political parties.

AB Top bureaucrats are the nexus between politics and administration. Besides being the chief operating officer of the ministry, they are technical experts and political advisors to the minister. This makes them central actors in bureaucratic studies. Despite their powerful position, few have studied their path to power. Utilizing sequence analysis, I analyze the career trajectories of permanent secretaries, providing a rich measure of career paths. Denmark is used as a case of a European parliamentary system, and a novel dataset has been collected containing career information on permanent secretaries from 1925 to 2020. The analysis reveals five ideal-typical career paths and illustrates how career trajectories have become more diverse over time. Fewer top bureaucrats are rising through the ranks within a single ministry; instead, there has been an increase in inter-ministerial shifts and in experience providing political craft. Finally, the position is becoming a steppingstone rather than the final position.

DT Article
DE top officials; selection; politicization; professionalism; management;
   public administration; Slovenia; research
AB One of the key drivers of modern and efficient public administration under the good governance doctrine is an efficient top officials' selection system. A targeted selection and recruitment system is a prerequisite for the whole administration to act in compliance with the political priorities of the government. However, civil servants and top officials alike must put professional competencies above political loyalty. Therefore, a new system was introduced in Slovenia following the 2003 Civil Servants Act, aimed at ensuring professionalism against (over)politicization of public administration. A research carried out in 2012 among candidates and selected top officials and ministers, as their political superiors, revealed an overall efficiency of the Slovenian selection scheme in the sense of restricted over-politicization and increased professionalism. Its outcomes lead to the conclusion that the selection system in Slovenia, owing to its two-phase professional and political selection, is most adequate in terms of both regulation and practice since it takes into account the twofold role of top officials and civil service or public administration as a whole (first, as a force providing professional solutions by ensuring legality and efficient resource management, and second, as the closest collaborators of the political leadership implementing government policies).

AB Do agencies implement the president's particularistic goals uniformly? This paper clarifies the presidential particularism literature by explicitly considering the mechanism through which the president pursues their policy goals: executive agencies. The constellation of bureaucratic agencies responsible for allocating grants plays a key role in facilitating or frustrating presidential policy priorities. Using a dataset of 21 agencies over 14 years, I find that only agencies ideologically proximate to the president engage in particularism benefiting the president. I find no evidence that politicization influences agency implementation of particularism. Critically, the moderating effect of the bureaucracy on particularism only occurs for distributive programs over which agencies have discretion. When disbursing formula grants written by Congress but administered by the bureaucracy with little or no discretion, ideological distance between agencies and presidents has no effect on particularism.

Therefore, in our paper we point to the weaknesses of the system and some of the crucial barriers that hindered efficient fund allocation: faulty institutional and legal framework. bureaucracy, corruption and personnel deficits. We base our findings oil research Of interviews carried out in four regions of Poland. Referring to Niklas Luhmann's theory Of autopoietic system, we sketch an image of all unevenly differentiated political system, in which administration and politics prevail over the underdeveloped and weak public, incapable of counteracting trends of politicization and expanded bureaucracy. By showing evolution and reproduction of the system, we relate to its deficits and their importance to future use of the flow of EU funds.

AB Most government bureaucracies in developed countries use civil service systems. What accounts for their adoption? We develop and test a model of bureaucratic reforms under repeated partisan competition. In the model, two political parties composed of overlapping generations of candidates compete for office. Under a spoils system, an incumbent politician can either continue to politicize the bureaucracy, which allows her to direct benefits to voters in a way that will increase her electoral prospects, or she can insulate the bureaucracy, which prevents all future winners from using the bureaucracy for electoral advantage. Our main result is that politicization persists when incumbents expect to win, and insulation takes place when they expect to lose. We test this hypothesis using data from the adoption of civil service reforms across the U.S. states.The predictions of the model are consistent with the empirical patterns leading up to the implementation of the general civil service reforms. Using both state and city level data, we observe an increase in partisan competition prior to the reforms.

In particular, it shows how PPPs predicated on transferring risks to the partner best able to manage them create opportunities for blame shifting by politicians, bureaucracies and firms when failures occur.

ID AGENCY DISCRETION; POLITICAL CONTROL; INCENTIVES; PATRONAGE
AB We investigate how aspects of "civil service" systems of personnel management interact with bureaucratic discretion to create expert bureaucracies populated by policy-motivated agents. We construct a dynamic model in which bureaucrats may invest in (relationship-specific) policy expertise and may or may not be interested in policy choices per se. The legislature makes sequentially rational grants of discretion, which serve as incentives for expertise investment and continued service only for policy-motivated bureaucrats. Bureaucratic policy preferences and the legislature's agency problem vis-a-vis bureaucracies develop endogenously in the model. Bureaucratic expertise can be supported in equilibrium only at a cost of its politicization; "neutral competence" is inconsistent with strategic incentives of bureaucrats. We identify several conditions that support the development of an expert bureaucracy in equilibrium, including security of job tenure and control over policy issues for policy-motivated bureaucrats.

DT Article
ID POLICY; POLITICS; PROMISE; IDEAS
AB This article asks how international secretariats can sometimes expand their authority in areas that relate neither to their mandate, nor to their sphere of expert authority. Existing explanations of mission creep assume that IOs act autonomously and expand in those areas that connect with their mandates, sense of organizational mission, and sphere of expert authority. The claim here is that entrepreneurial bureaucrats can succeed in the absence of policy deadlock among states in creating creep in unexpected issue domains through the mobilization of external expertise. The article examines this dynamic in the domain of bioethical standards. It shows that UNESCO acted as a first mover in the field, despite having no relevant expertise, and despite bioethics being more closely connected to the mandate of other organizations. Entrepreneurial bureaucrats within UNESCO were able to create creep in bioethics by mobilizing external experts in the field and capturing their skills. Working with external experts endowed their organization with the capacity to act, gave epistemic authority to their actions, and prevented the politicization of debates in a potentially controversial issue domain. In pointing to the strategic uses of expertise, the article challenges the commonly held view that expert knowledge acts as a means of solving problems and rationalizing global governance.

SO MODERN ASIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Building on recent scholarship that highlights social change caused by the Anti-Japanese War, this paper traces the politicization of women working in the cotton mills of Chongqing, the Nationalist wartime capital. Upon joining the workforce in the late 1930s, most cotton mill hands were young, uneducated women expected to endure hard work and remain physically confined to the factories. By 1945, women workers were at the forefront of a militant labour movement, writing manifestoes and petitioning government officials. This process of politicization stemmed from their decision to work in factories, which breached societal norms, and their experience of disciplined labour regimes and brutal working conditions, which fostered an incipient class-consciousness. Moreover, Nationalist-sponsored factory education campaigns had the unintended effect of leading women to challenge class exploitation and sexual discrimination. Their participation in the labour movement, which was fuelled by their struggle for economic justice and desire for higher social status, used both legal forms-especially petitions and letters to the press couched in the wartime nationalist rhetoric of shared sacrifice-and extralegal means, namely class violence. The paper concludes that the social changes and conflict that accompanied women's wartime work helped prepare the terrain for Communist rule.

AB This article addresses the issue of how political and administrative actors relate to each other, focusing on the selection of Senior Civil Servants as key actors to implement public policies. A literature review and documental analysis were carried out, and an on-line questionnaire was applied to Senior Civil Servants in managerial positions in Portugal between 2004 and 2011 (n = 964). The results show that, in all cases, the p-value was equal or less than .05 (p <= .05). The analysis allowed us to confirm two main criteria used for the selection of Senior Civil Servants (political and professional) and their respective factors. Despite indicating that the political criterion somehow plays a role in the selection of public officials in Portugal, the study could not confirm the hypothesis that political factors are predominant when hiring senior civil servants in the country.

We identify the main processes through which depoliticization is operated by IOs: the use of ethics and norms, the political neutralization of their official rhetoric, and the resorting to multiform expertise as a means of apolitical self-legitimization. We also explore the factors that may explain this tendency to depoliticize: their problematic status in regard to democratic theory, the diplomatic constraints attached to the intergovernmental structure of their managing bodies, and the administrative and cultural constraints that befall IOs' bureaucracies. Finally, we try to go beyond the concept of depoliticization by stressing the consequences of politicization that stem from IOs' resilient political rhetoric and from the ethical norms and expertise produced by IOs. Because IOs cannot totally eliminate political controversy and debates, the idea of international depoliticized governance' as a result of IOs activity should be put into perspective.

AB Over-politicization co-exists in the Croatian public administration with legalism, formalism and red tape. Low reform, innovation and initiative capacities are among the results of such an administrative model. Croatia has a relatively big and strong but inefficient public administration. Internal bureaucratic resistance to modernization is observable. Foreign actors play a moderate role in administrative reform. The European Union has exerted the strongest influence on modernization on the basis of conditionality policy, insistence on the administrative capacity building, and the European Semester procedure. E-government policy, transparency, and strategic planning are the reform areas with the above-average reform results.

AB The theory that we shall seek to elaborate here puts considerable emphasis on the importance of big-time corruption in reducing funding for service delivery, the value of bureaucracy as a means of delivering public services, and the level of politicization of the public bureaucracy. This paper seeks to fill a gap in the current literature by examining different aspects of the benefits of openness and transparency in tackling corruption in the public sector, the bureaucratization of service tasks, and the failure of bureaucratic systems in delivering public services. In sum, the results of the current paper provide useful insights on the context and causes of corruption, incentives to assure efficiency within the public bureaucracy, and the organizational limits of public bureaucracy.

AB Using official statistics, bureaucratic registers and ethnographic material collected from the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) from six districts across six Indian states, the article explains under what conditions the capacity of last-mile bureaucracy matters for the performance of pro-poor welfare programmes in the Indian federal polity. In seeking to address the presence of heterogenous welfare outcomes in the districts of India, the article underscores the salience of last-mile bureaucrats and the extent to which the politicization of redistributive struggles might contribute to local state capacity to deliver welfare services, a hitherto under-researched aspect in comparative social development research. Challenging the conventional thesis that only a strong autonomous state succeeds in implementing welfare programmes, the article further argues that effective policy implementation can occur within the peculiar environment of relatively low-capacity last-mile bureaucracies even in the face of adverse socioeconomic circumstances. In short, the article shifts attention to the understudied relationship between the capacity of last-mile bureaucracy and welfare outcomes in India.

AB This paper analyzes the impact of centralization process of presidential political power during the last decade (2003-2015) on human resources management policies within the National Public Administration. This period of systematic concentration of powers in the hands of the president was accompanied by a progressive expansion of nomination capacities in order to guarantee the political adherence of the bureaucracy to the official project. The flexibilization of designations was the main resource used by governments to ensure political leadership over bureaucracy. The presidents mainly resorted to two appointment strategies to spread their margin of discretion: (1) the extension of the structure of transitional hiring outside the career system; and (2) the colonization of hierarchical positions through exception. The increasing use of these flexible mechanisms contributed to limit the full institutionalization of a professional bureaucracy, negatively affecting both the size of the state apparatus and government performance.

AB When politicians employ public servants, have those people peculiar attitudes toward politics and policies? This paper assesses this topic through trajectories and working practices of senior civil servants in French local governments. A mix of political sociology and of sociology of work, it focuses on generational patterns of political attitudes and thereby renews the thesis of "politicized" public managers. It demonstrates that new patterns in careers increasing diploma requirements, fewer social mobility, increasing geographical mobility and decreasing steady employment contracts - result in less personalized relations toward politicians, although political screening remains strong.

AB The tension between merit-based and discretionary appointments is a constant challenge to civil service reform in Latin America. However, studies of the politicization of public employment do not tend to analyze the changes to the structure of the state apparatus as a strategy to incorporate public officials on the basis of discretionary appointments. Indeed, it is often noted that there are many ways of avoiding merit-based entry, though there is scarce empirical evidence about what these are and how they vary over time. To begin to fill this gap, this paper presents the influence of changes in the organizational structures of the state in the increase in discretionary appointments to the state apparatus. To do this, it examines the case of Argentina between the years 2003 and 2016.

AB This article deals from a bureaucratic point of view with the relationship between education administration, education politics, and schools within the so-called "new" school system management. Its main thesis is, that there is an increasing politicization of education administration. This means mixing functions, which are originally separated according to bureaucracy theory. After describing the bureaucratic relationship between education politics and education administration, the expectations are outlined, which are ascribed to education administration within the current school system management. Subsequently, the development of the administrative politicization thesis is shown empirically. Finally, the administrative politicization and thus a new "addressing policy" is accentuated as one of the central structural problems of the new school system management.

ID PARTY SYSTEM; POLITICIZATION; TEMPORALITY; MECHANISMS; CRISIS
AB A widespread strategy to enhance political control over permanent bureaucracy consists of the politicization of personnel policy through the appointment of ministerial advisers. This study sets out to investigate the appointment of ministerial advisers from an historical institutionalist perspective emphasizing the influence of institutional legacies on current empirical patterns. Drawing on this perspective, it identifies three patterns of institutional stability, radical, and gradual change in terms of ministerial advisers' policy competence and political loyalty, which guide the empirical analysis. Empirical patterns are illustrated with data collected in Italy, based on an analysis of a combination of career pathways and expert interviews. The Italian case is noteworthy since it experienced an abrupt party system breakdown in the early 1990s. Yet, the empirical analysis reveals that the massive re-alignment of the party system has not implied a pattern of radical change in Italy. The legacy of stable administrative structures has only left room for gradual change to occur on the dimensions of ministerial advisers' policy competence and political loyalty.

ID POLITICAL-LEADERSHIP; WORLD; UK
AB The worlds of local bureaucrats are under researched and under theorized compared with those of civil servants in core executives. Yet local bureaucratic elites, sitting as they do between central states and localities, are key actors in governance networks. In England, the role and responsibilities of local bureaucratic elites has been transformed since the days of professionalized officers heading departmental structures reporting to committees, firstly by NPM and politicization in the 1980s and 1990s and, more recently, by political management reform introducing a separation of powers. Drawing on interviews in 15 local authorities, this paper examines the changing narratives and dilemmas of local government elites. In particular it explores, but argues against, early expectations that the creation of an elected executive, with considerable devolution of decision-making responsibilities to individual cabinet member councillors, has meant a move closer to the logics of the 'Whitehall mandarin' tradition by local government chief officers.

AB In 2014, the largest reform since the US postwar occupation was enacted in Japanese civil service. It was designed as the final step of the two-decade-long effort to restructure the "1955 System," that is, the politico-administrative system developed under the Liberal Democratic Party's hegemony. Its purpose was to remold Japan's independent-minded bureaucrats into the elected officials' obedient servants. Unfortunately, the reform is unlikely to deliver expected results. The failure's major reason concerns the fact that Japanese bureaucracy's unusually large role in policymaking paradoxically discourages elected officials to use their major reining tool against it, namely, appointive power.

DE The History of Islamic Sects; Khalqu'l-Qur'an; Bishr al-Marisi; Mihna;
   Ma'mun
AB In the history of mankind, God has addressed to mankind through the divine books which He has sent through His prophets from time to time. Mankind has always wondered about the nature of the books bearing this address. As a matter of fact, their reflection can be seen in Jewish and Christian societies. In the same way, this curiosity is felt in the Islamic society. In this frame, Muslims have debated whether or not the Qur'an was created as a creature (Khalqu'l-Qur'an) at certain periods of history, and the extent of these debates reached even the dimensions that could affect the masses of society.
   It is known that the discussions taking place around the Khalqu'l-Qur'an have come to the fore especially during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods. In this respect, it is important to investigate the social reasons of the discussion in these periods and societies in order to reach correct results. As a matter of fact, Arap-Mavali relation which forms the social doctrine of Arap society in particular and the social class struggle in this context are remarkable. In this context, it can be argued that the social class-based struggle continued its existence by evolving through an argumentation of the Quran on the controversies of the Quran in certain sections of history, mainly conjunctural reasons. As a matter of fact, it is striking that the members of Mu'tazilah and Murji'ah, who expressed and defended the view that the Qur'an is a creature, and the ones who advocated more are based on the Arab masses of the Qur'an, and the social class struggle in the background of the debate.
   It is known that during the Abbasids period, this debate was brought to the agenda by Bishr al-Marisi during the reign of Harun Rashid, but the Caliph threatened him by reacting to this debate. For this reason, Bishr could not show the courage to appear around during his sovereignity and he had to hide for about 20 years.
   The process of moving the debate of Khalqu'l-Qur'an to the social strata and the process of politicization corresponds to the period of the Caliphate of Ma'mun. The reasons for this should be sought in the socio-political structure of the period in which Ma'mun came to the scribe. As a matter of fact, it is known that the social and political structure started to show differentiation to the caliphs of the earlier caliphs, and that in this context, the polarizations were felt in the society and sociological structures with the potential to threaten the central authority began to be seen in the society. Under these circumstances, it is the priority of the Caliph Ma'mun as a responsible manager to secure the future of the state.
   Therefore, the new caliph needs to adopt new policies that are centered on the future of the country. For this reason, noteworthy political practices, especially the debates on the people of Qur'an, which took place during this period, should be evaluated within this framework. It is important to remember that, as a substructure of these policies, Ma'mun reached the caliphate office after a struggle with his brother al-Amin who had reached the caliphate before him.
   When Ma'mun was a Caliph, he first moved the central of the caliphate to Merv. After about six years there, he returned to Baghdad. The Caliph known as a science enthusiast, in Baghdad, formed scientific assemblies where the issues of discussion in the society were discussed by the competent and reached a conclusion and in this context, the aim of clarifying the world of mind was clarified. In these assemblies, he gathered scholars and thinkers who were accepted in society. However, it was noteworthy that these scholars were mostly of Mu'tazili or Murcii thought. These people were discussing the issues that society or politics needed, reaching a conclusion, and sometimes discussing what they wanted. As a matter of fact, one of the issues raised by them was the issue of the Qur'an, which centered on whether the Qur'an was created or not.
   It is known that this issue is an agenda in the councils for a while. The issues discussed here were reflected to the public. Therefore, there were people who declared these views, as well as those who declared opposing views. As a matter of fact, it is known that Kinani el-Mekki comes from Mecca in order to challenge the issue of the people and the Qur'an, and they discuss with Bisr al-Marisi in the presence of the caliph.
   In this very long discussion, many issues around the subject came to the agenda. During the discussion, however, it is known that Kinani revealed the contradictions of Bishr because of his knowledge of the subtleties of the Qur'an and Arabic language, while he won Ma'mun's appreciation and countenance, and even rewarded him for the pleasure he received from the discussion and for the satisfying style of Kinani's argument.
   It is assumed that this debate took place in the presence of Caliph Ma'mun in 208/824. It is known that the effects of these and similar discussions continue in the following process, and that this issue is discussed and discussed in both the public and management levels. Probably with this, the subject was intended to mature in the minds.
   One of the most noteworthy points of the discussion is that Kinani's dominance over the subject and his influence on the subject are ignored by Bishr. However, it is meaningful that, after a four-year period through discussion, the Caliph Ma'mun officially declared that he believes the Qur'an was created in 212/827. Undoubtedly, this situation can be explained by the fact that the caliph was persuaded by the opposing viewers in the last period, but it can also be explained as a responsible state manager who pays attention the conjuncture with future-centered concerns.
   In the light of the resources we have available, we see that the Caliph Ma'mun has no belief that Qur'an has the belief that he is a creature. The actual process of politicization of the subject of Khalqu'l-Qur'an was over six years after this official declaration, while in 218/833 the Caliph Ma'mun was on the road against Byzantium, he sent some letters to Ishaq b. Ibrahim. This situation is undoubtedly remarkable for the politicization of the debate of Qur'anic conception. As a matter of fact, it is noteworthy that a subject that is seen at the academic or scientific level is being initiated during a period when social unity must be taken as a result of a political experience at a time when the caliph is far from the center and about twenty years of experience. In our opinion, this gives the impression that political concerns are prioritized rather than academic concerns. Although the details of this are outside of our context, it can be stated that the social unity concern arising from the previous experiences of the caliph had a significant effect on this decision.
   The Caliph orders to Ishak b. Ibrahim that he must gather the Qadis and bureaucrats around him, to test them consept of the letter he has sent him, whether the Qur'an is a creature. With this order, perhaps a subject that should remain in the academic platform is the issue of the Qur'an, which was transformed into a state policy by moving to political ground and started the process of politicization.

AB This paper seeks to situate Jewish individuals from the upper echelons of the Mongol government in Iran and Iraq (1258-1335) in relation to the process of confessional, Sunni-Shi'i polarization. Focusing on the case of the Baghdadi Jewish physician and vizier Sa'd al-Dawla (d. 1291), I explore how the Jewish minister sought to take advantage of Twelver-Shi'i rise to prominence under the Mongols. I argue that the vizier attempted to strike an alliance with the Shi'i communities in Iraq and with influential Shi'i families with long-established ties to the Mongol regime, in order to curtail resistance to his policies and to the Jewish dominance in the realm's bureaucracy. I consider Sa'd al-Dawla's endeavors within the broader historical context of Shi'i-Jewish relations. The article concludes by examining the two decades following Sa'd al-Dawla's downfall, when a group of eminent Jewish physicians at the Mongol court converted to Islam. I show how these converts continued to exploit the process of politicization of confessional identities under the Mongols.

AB This article analyzes the influence of the media on the central Norwegian immigration administration. Through behind-the-scenes ethnographic methods, it explores how key bureaucratic values such as impartiality, neutrality and loyalty are challenged and modified by the impact of the news media. A key question is to what extent this process of mediatization overlaps with a more general trend of politicization of the civil service. The article first documents that media pressure generates comprehensive strategies aimed at servicing the press, but also different types of information control and internal steering. Second, it describes how media management has become an important concern within public administration, which identifies strongly with the bureaucratic system and its values, and protects and defends it in the media. The article introduces the term administrative loyalty' to describe these practices and standards that go beyond the imperative to loyally serve the media-related needs of political superiors.

ID IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION; ANTHROPOLOGY; ETHNOGRAPHY; STATES
AB Migrant integration policies in the Netherlands have become increasingly restrictive over the past two decades. This development has been prompted chiefly by the strong politicization of the subject of integration and, as a consequence, a growing political interference with policymaking. Policy design and construction is predominantly carried out by policy officials in state bureaucracies. Some of these actors, however, have great difficulties with the restrictive turn in integration policies and the associated political discourse. Policy officials use the concept of professionalism to describe how they cope with the ambiguity between their personal convictions and the professional role they are expected to play. Thus, professionalism symbolizes cultural orientations, norms and values that are important in the bureaucratic organization. In this paper, we argue that the discourse of professionalism functions as a disciplinary logic that controls policy officials, but that simultaneously endows their work with meaning and creates a feeling of belonging.

AB According to polls, the proportion of Czech respondents who perceived irregular migration as a real and serious security threat doubled from 32% in 2014 to 65% in 2015. By means of a content analysis of the news stories published by three Czech online news portals, this study examines the extent to which images of a threat and an appeal for security were part of the media coverage of the European migration crisis. While only small differences in extent were observed among the three portals, the findings suggest that the crisis was depicted mainly in terms of governance, i.e. as a burden to the state or as a security threat. All three news portals gave prominence to qualities like urgency, extraordinariness, overload and insecurity, and attributed these qualities to the figure of an indefinite wave of migrants heading to Europe. The humanitarian dimension of the reported events was marginalised. The findings indicate a striking dependence on institutional sources, mainly government officials. Almost exclusive salience was given to the governmental agenda. Authorship of every other news story was assigned to the Czech Press Agency. Aforementioned partial characteristics of the coverage resulted in highly politicized image of the crisis, which to considerable extent was presented as a security threat.

AB This article reports the first empirical evidence that politicians delegate to trusted bureaucrats to diminish political responsibility for policy. Political science has been perennially concerned with why political leaders delegate authority to bureaucrats, but this work's focus on advanced democracies has overlooked how corruption and political influence over bureaucrats can turn delegation into a means of obfuscating responsibility. Using a measure that differentiates political corruption from corruption at lower levels of government and a new data set of policy making on more than 600 European Commission directives in the 10 former communist European Union (EU) member states, I show that political-level corruption is associated with increased delegation to bureaucrats. This relationship between political corruption and bureaucratic discretion is conditional upon the political independence of the bureaucracy, such that politicians engaged in corruption delegate more to reduce clarity of responsibility only when they possess informal means to influence bureaucrats.

AB In this article, we explore the determinants of reforms intending to integrate policies and coordinate administrative units by focusing on necessary conditions. Firstly, we elaborate theoretical expectations about potential necessary conditions for cross-sectoral reforms. Secondly, we conduct a condition-oriented fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to examine our expectations, based on an original data set comparing policy integration and administrative coordination reforms, in environmental and unemployment policy, across 13 countries over 29 years. Our results indicate three necessary conditions for high reform intensity: external problem pressure is necessary for policy integration and administrative coordination in employment policy; either the strength or weakness of the reference party can take the role of necessary conditions depending on the policy field; low politicization of bureaucracy is necessary, especially for administrative coordination in environmental policy. These findings contribute to the development of a systematic theory of cross-sectoral policy and administrative change.

AB The politicization of bureaucracy is a widespread strategy to increase the political control of ministerial departments in parliamentary democracies. It is, however, largely unknown why executive politicians promote some officials rather than others to high public office. Based on a unique data-set of all senior officials in German federal ministries and agencies that held office in the period 1997-2015, this article investigates whether partisan loyalty, political craft, and managerial competencies influence the chance of promotion to the highest civil service position in Germany (state secretary). We apply event history modeling to draw inferences on the relative importance of different selection criteria used by ministers when recruiting state secretaries from a candidate pool of senior officials. A key finding is that ministers consistently prefer politically loyal to nonloyal candidates. Although ministers also consider candidates' political craft and selected managerial competencies, they are likely to trade-off partisan loyalty against those qualifications. The article contributes to the literature on politicization in the public sector by comparing potential and actual office holders and by including a broad set of selection criteria, moving beyond the literature's dominating focus on partisan loyalty. The methodological approach developed in this article may well be transferred to other institutional contexts and used for comparative studies in this area.

AB The article deals with the issue of structural and cohesion funding by the European Union in Poland. Although all funds earmarked for the first programming period 2004-2006 were allocated, the process posed certain problems. Therefore, in our paper we point to the weaknesses of the system and some of the hindrances to efficient fund allocation: faulty institutional and legal framework, bureaucracy, corruption and personnel deficits.
   We base our findings on a research incorporating 150 in-depth interviews carried out in four regions of Poland. Referring to Niklas Luhmann's theory of autopoietic systems, we present a sketch of an unevenly differentiated political system, in which administration and politics prevail over the underprivileged public, incapable of counteracting trends of politicization and bureaucratization. By showing the evolution and reproduction of the system, we relate to its deficits and their impact on the future use of the EU funds inflow.

AB The Council is too often depicted as the battleground for intermittent clashes between national ministers. Based upon case studies of legislation produced in five `First Pillar' sectors, the research presented here has explored the submerged, and much larger, part of this institutional `iceberg': Council working groups. It does so by examining how members of these entities interact with civil servants in COREPER and ministers, on the one hand, and representatives of the Commission and the European Parliament, on the other. Contrary to many practitioner or formalist accounts, the principal finding is that working groups do not operate solely on a `technical level'. Instead, they are vital arenas through which the ambiguous nature of politics in the European Union heavily influences negotiating processes and legislative outcomes.

AB In January 2016, academics in Turkey distributed a peace petition calling for an end to hostilities and to restart negotiations with the Kurdish movement. The Turkish government responded by opening legal cases, jailing academics, and dismissing them from universities. In the state of emergency following the July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, the government's extended powers allowed them to fire thousands of civil servants from every branch of government, including thousands of academics. This increased the number of academics who organized to form and teach in academic collectives. The current study evaluates how politicization occurs in scholars removed from the university environment. Traditional approaches to collective action and politicization suggest that empowerment is an important catalyst in politicization and continuation of collective political engagement. With the social and political restrictions that decree law dismissals place on scholars, what is it that motivates them to politicize? The current study was conducted through semistructured interviews with nine academics who work in these collectives. Participants described their politicization in terms of previous practice, reaction to injustice, and ideals of academia and academic freedom. They further evaluated current and prospective functions and possible barriers to academic collectives. Finally, although somewhat ambivalent, participants discussed feelings of efficacy, psychosocial support, and senses of solidarity and liberation in terms of being empowered. Their perspectives provide an opportunity to understand how and where academics engage in scholar activism for an independent and free academia in the context of consolidated political oppression.

AB The use of politically appointed ministerial advisors has increased noticeably in many Western countries, but we know little about how this development has affected the civil servants recruited on merit. The article asks whether political appointees accentuate or blur the line between politics and administration. Do political appointees take over political-tactical advice and leave policy advice to the permanent civil service, or do they cause permanent civil servants to be even more influenced by political considerations? And do political appointees make it easier or more difficult for the permanent civil service to be politically responsive? A Most Similar Systems Design comparison of Denmark and Sweden allows an assessment of the effects of political appointees. It is found that a large number of political appointees decreases functional politicisation of the permanent civil service; that functional politicisation tends to crowd out tasks related to more classic policy advice; and that functional politicisation increases political responsiveness.

ID GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; ATMOSPHERE
AB This paper traces the development of numerical climate models in the United Kingdom from 1963, when the U.K.'s Meteorological Office first took up climate modelling, to the mid-to-late 1970s, when climate change became politicized in the United Kingdom. The central question posed is how U.K. climate modellers developed rhetoric, managed expectations, and weighed their professional and political responsibilities in the face of growing political interest in climate change. Whilst the modellers were reluctant to allow the modelling results to be used for political ends, U.K. civil servants saw climate modelling as a modern tool for a new problem. As scientific and political agendas diverged, the director of the Meteorological Office, John Mason, found himself caught between his position as a government employee in a service organization and his responsibility as a gatekeeper between climate models and their potential uses. Ultimately, as Mason and his modellers were forced to admit, their climate models became cultural and political as well as scientific objects.

TI 'Maternal deaths should simply be 0': politicization of maternal death

ID TALL ORDER; MORTALITY; SURVEILLANCE; INDICATORS; LESSONS; POLICY
AB The Maternal Death Surveillance and Response system (MDSR) was implemented in Ethiopia in 2013 to record and reviewmaternal deaths. The overall aim of the system is to identify and address gaps in order to prevent future death but, to date, around 10% of the expected number of deaths are reported. This article examines practices and reasoning involved in maternal death reporting and review practices in Ethiopia, building on the concept of 'practical norms'. The study is based on multi-sited fieldwork at different levels of the Ethiopian health system including interviews, document analysis and observations, and has documented the politicized nature of MDSR implementation. Death reporting and review are challenged by the fact that maternal mortality is a main indicator of health system performance. Health workers and bureaucrats strive to balance conflicting demands when implementing the MDSR system: to report all deaths; to deliver perceived success in maternal mortality reduction by reporting as few deaths as possible; and to avoid personalized accountability for deaths. Fear of personal and political accountability for maternal deaths strongly influences not only reporting practices but also the care given in the study sites. Health workers report maternal deaths in ways that minimize their number and deflect responsibility for adverse outcomes. They attribute deaths to community and infrastructural factors, which are often beyond their control. The practical norms of how health workers report deaths perpetuate a skewed way of seeing problems and solutions in maternal health. On the basis of our findings, we argue that closer attention to the broader political context is needed to understand the implementation of MDSR and other surveillance systems.

ID PUBLIC-GOODS; DIVERSITY; POLITICS; STATE; POLICIES; HISTORY
AB As one of the most potent hypothesis in political economy, the negative impact of ethnic diversity on the provision of public goods made the welfare state-nation state isomorphism seem a one-way connection. Against the grain of existing studies I argue, through a case-study of interwar Romania, that welfare states are constructed to proactively (re)build the nation, rather than retroactively emanate from it, once established. Rather than an ahistorical ethnolinguistic fractionalization, the article takes nationhood as historically fluid and contested because through institutionalized action, elites can and do proactively revamp the political arena, redistributing coalitions of winners and losers based on exogenously given criteria. The article therefore shows that nation forgers typically internalize the global social question through the topoi of local socio-economic problems construed as a national question. Because elites can pick and choose who becomes part of the national compact, the politicization of the perception of incomplete nationhood provides a sufficient ideational thrust for welfare policymaking, irrespective of pre-existing national solidarities. Consequently, welfare policies are typically layered as remedial or compensatory policies designed to foster a specific social mobility, deemed in a top-down fashion to be completing the nation.

ID TRANSITION
AB Prior to becoming president, Donald Trump was widely known as a successful business executive. As a candidate, Trump promised to run government like his business. His supporters and critics, however, disagree about how the president has performed as a manager. In this article, we review President Trump's performance as a manager during his first year in office. We examine three dimensions of his approachtransition preparation, staffing, and management style. Notably, we find that the president's halting transition limited his effectiveness in the first year. Unlike previous presidents, President Trump chose neither a politicizing nor a centralizing strategy to gain control over administrative policy making during his first year. We also note that President Trump prefers a competitive and freewheeling decision-making environment but is struggling with the consequences of such a structure. The article concludes with an assessment of the first year and prospects for the president moving forward.

ID CIVIL-SERVICE; GOVERNMENT; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; BRITAIN
AB The expression 'Whitehall Model' has a certain heuristic value for describing four key features of the British civil service, namely political neutrality, generalism, life-long career paths and a strong policy advisory role. This model has been challenged by politicization, changes in career management and recruitment as well as increasing competition from other sources of policy advice. The UK civil service's role in relation to ministers seems to have become increasingly defined in managerial terms and decreasingly as policy advisers, not least because a range of other individuals and bodies (advisers, consultants, think tanks, party research departments) now share this role. While it appears to be enjoying a diminishing policy role, the senior civil service has not, at least so far, managed to occupy the high ground in its managerial role. The biggest change in the model is a collapse of confidence in the civil service, not only among citizens, but also among politicians and civil servants themselves.

AB The Spadina Expressway controversy in Toronto, Ontario, was sparked by a proposal to run an expressway into the heart of the city. The dispute was part of a broader movement against high modernist planning that swept American and Canadian cities in the 196os and 1970s. Frustrated by unresponsive politicians and civic officials, citizen activists challenged authorities with an alternate vision for cities that prioritized the safeguarding of the urban environment by preserving communities, preventing environmental degradation, and promoting public transit. By the latter half of the 1960s, citizen activists were no longer fighting alone, as some politicians and civil servants also turned against more traditional modes of city planning. This politicization of urban planning and transportation schemes culminated in the defeat of expressway networks in cities across Canada and the United States, including the Spadina Expressway in 1971. A landmark decision and important precursor to the municipal reform movement that would follow, the legacy of the Spadina episode was nevertheless mixed.

AB In this article I discuss how the pandemic state of emergency has formed a subject field in Islamic biopolitics. By analysing the fatwas and official statements issued by Russian Muslim leaders between March and May 2020, I identify their discursive strategy of 'interpreting' the language of bureaucracy and medical terminology into the language of Islam, and of providing theological justification for certain governmental decisions. I consider several cases which illustrate the intervention of political and medical discourses of corporality into religious discourse. These include the politicisation of the regulatory functioning of the body, the sacralisation of quarantine as a special time for spiritual activities, the formatting of funerary ritual according to medico-administrative regulations and the comparing of victory in the Great Patriotic War to the victory over COVID-19.

SO CHINA QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB The stagnation in banking sector reform is puzzling given the Chinese leadership's seeming resolve to reform other sectors of the economy. This article develops a political explanation of why reform oriented central bureaucrats have centralized financial power without liberalizing the banking sector. The starting point of this explanation is that top bureaucrats value political survival as much as other members of the Politburo. Thus, they make policies based on both political and economic considerations. This framework is tested on three cases related to China's non-performing loan (NPL) problem: the politicization of the NPL problem, policies designed to slow the creation of NPLs and policies aimed at decreasing the pool of NPLs. The findings strongly suggest that political considerations play a large role in shaping financial policies in China.

Although the majority of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance and civil servants in many areas have not received salaries since 2016, many healthcare providers continue to work, and families continue to need and seek care.MethodsThis case study examines how reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH+N) services have been delivered since 2015, and identifies factors influencing implementation of these services in three governorates of Yemen. Content analysis methods were used to analyze publicly available documents and datasets published since 2000 as well as 94 semi-structured individual and group interviews conducted with government officials, humanitarian agency staff and facility-based healthcare providers and six focus group discussions conducted with community health midwives and volunteers in September-October 2018.ResultsHumanitarian response efforts focus on maintaining basic services at functioning facilities, and deploying mobile clinics, outreach teams and community health volunteer networks to address urgent needs where access is possible. Attention to specific aspects of RMNCAH+N varies slightly by location, with differences driven by priorities of government authorities, levels of violence, humanitarian access and availability of qualified human resources. Health services for women and children are generally considered to be a priority; however, cholera control and treatment of acute malnutrition are given precedence over other services along the continuum of care. Although health workers display notable resilience working in difficult conditions, challenges resulting from insecurity, limited functionality of health facilities, and challenges in importation and distribution of supplies limit the availability and quality of services.ConclusionsChallenges to providing quality RMNCAH+N services in Yemen are formidable, given the nature and scale of humanitarian needs, lack of access due to insecurity, politicization of aid, weak health system capacity, costs of care seeking, and an ongoing cholera epidemic. Greater attention to availability, quality and coordination of RMNCAH services, coupled with investments in health workforce development and supply management are needed to maintain access to life-saving services and mitigate longer term impacts on maternal and child health and development. Lessons learned from Yemen on how to address ongoing primary health care needs during massive epidemics in conflict settings, particularly for women and children, will be important to support other countries faced with similar crises in the future.

AB This study overviews and appraises Turkey's contemporary public administration system. Its prominent characterizing features are discussed, with an emphasis on both the achievements and problem areas. Turkey has a long history of strong traditional bureaucratic practices and culture, from which its contemporary public administration system has emerged since the Republic was established almost a century ago. Despite its many achievements, public administration has its problems, generally the product of conflicts between tradition and modernity. Due emphasis should, however, be given to addressing the challenges of its over-politicization, strengthening governance practices, enhancing the human factor, and instituting further modern administrative reforms.

ID STATE
AB This article argues that corruption is used on a systematic basis as a mechanism of direct and indirect administrative control from the state level down to local authorities and administrations of public and private institutions of higher education. Informal approval of corrupt activities in exchange for loyalty and compliance with the regime was commonplace in the former Soviet Union. This article explains how corrupt regimes maximize their position in terms of loyalty and compliance using the example of the 2004 presidential elections in Ukraine, which later became known as the Orange Revolution. The 2010 presidential elections and their aftermath pose new challenges to those aspiring to power. This article presents mechanisms by which political bureaucracies politicize universities in order to influence students and channel their electoral power during presidential campaigns.

ID LABOR-MARKET POLICIES; WELFARE; CITIZENSHIP
AB Contemporary active labour market (ALM) reforms are pivotal in the reorganization of the welfare state as they challenge and threaten some of the fundamental achievements of labour in capitalist societies: social programmes and entitlements that compensate for unemployment, and governance arrangements in which the social partners share authority and responsibility with the state. Consequently, ALM reforms may give raise to social unrest and political struggle that involves the state (the main proponent of ALM reforms), trade unions and political parties. These conflicts are important in the politicization of reforms, i.e. raising public awareness of and engagement with controversies of welfare state change.
   In this article, we use a non-European perspective to ask more generally how distinct historical institutions create separate 'politicization trajectories' of ALM reforms, which in turn produce different policy designs and outcomes. Centring on the case of Israel, in which historically 'abnormal' class politics fostered indifference to the reform in both trade unions and political parties, we maintain that the preliminary de-politicization made it possible for bureaucrats to control the reform, leading to an intra-state conflict between competing agencies over its design and implementation. The usurpation of the reform by the Ministry of Finance made it conspicuously unbalanced, provoking many grievances. Paradoxically, the de-politicization of the reform advanced its re-politicization, led by non-governmental advocacy organizations in civil society. These uncommon political actors in the politics of ALM reforms were able to lead a counter-coalition, delegitimize the reform, and mobilize politicians to eventually terminate activation

ID POLITICS; PARADIGMS; LESSONS
AB After an initial phase of firefighting against the euro crisis that began in 2010, one that was characterized by policies that focused on strict austerity, from 2014 onwards the European Commission gradually began to ease its recommendations about fiscal consolidation. Between 2015 and 2016, this policy turn was reflected in series of procedural changes in the European Semester. These gave the Commission a certain degree of discretion in applying the rules and interpreting the benchmarks of the post-crisis EU economic governance arrangements. This article investigates if this double shift in fiscal policy and governance that was initiated in 2014 has been consolidated in 2019, and, if so, what has driven that consolidation. By building on the literatures on EU politicization and policy learning, it asks whether the character of this intra-paradigm policy shift has been more Bayesian or sociological. Based on interviews and on a small-scale survey conducted with key civil servants working at the European Commission, we find evidence to support the putative explanation that, through a political process of policy learning, European Semester officials have acquired a more politicized and flexible practice of fiscal governance and a more social vision of the European Semester.

AB Three phenomena that undermine the U.S. administrative state were taken to extremes under President Trump, contributing to democratic backsliding. The first is delegitimization: a suspicion of the public sector that has curdled into claims that public officials are deep state enemies of the people. This undermines belief in the capacity of government to deliver on democratic promises. Second is deconstruction, which includes undermining administrative capacity and delivery of services, making it harder for institutions to deliver on democratic promises, or to do so in ways that are transparent or generative of conditions in which the public sees government helping. The third is political control, in which loyalty to the political leaders is a primary virtue: this weakens structural protections of public employees and the capacities of government agencies to pursue their statutory mission or respond to other sources of democratic control such as Congress.

AB In looking at the ways in which the relationship between environmental matters and the political developed and changed in West Germany during the long 1970s, this article re-interprets the 'ecological revolution' that occurred at that time and rethinks the trajectory of German environmentalism. To get at the politicization of environmental concerns in the 1970s, the article compares two narratives: the 'technocratic invention' of environmental politics by government officials, and the career of grassroots anti-nuclear activism. It shows that though these two trends developed in relationship with one another, their protagonists increasingly came to speak past one other. Not only did they begin to understand environmental problems in different ways, they also drew different conclusions about where environmental matters were to be debated, and what ought to be done in order to resolve environmental concerns. By describing these developments and the approaches to environmental politics they brought forth, the article reconceives the ecological revolution as an extended period when conflicting interpretations of environmental affairs underpinned competing approaches to politics as such. While government officials sought to make the environment part of standard political praxis, grassroots activists used environmental concerns as a wedge to push open a wider debate about popular participation within parliamentary democracy. The long confrontation between these two perspectives gave way, during the 1980s, to an environmentalism that was not only level-headed and consensual, but also a seminal concern of German politics.

ID CIVIL-SERVICE; MORAL HAZARD; POLITICIZATION; POLITICS; REFORM
AB This article aims to explain cross-country variations in a paradigmatic element of the new public management reforms: the shift from low-powered incentives (i.e., flat salaries) to high-powered ones (i.e., performance-related pay [PRP] systems). It presents a theoretical model based on insights developed for understanding the success of performance-related incentives in the private sector. Economic literature has underlined the need for a system of separation of interests within firms to make promises on incentives credible. The interests of those who benefit from the incentives (e.g., owners) must be relatively different from the interests of those who manage the incentive system (e.g., managers). Similarly, this article argues that incentives in the public sector are more likely to be implemented in those administrations in which there is a relative separation between those who benefit from the incentives (e.g., politicians) and those who manage the incentive system (e.g., senior civil servants). Where the interests of both groups overlap (e.g., the careers of senior officials and politicians are intertwined), incentives will be less credible and thus less likely. A quantitative analysis for 25 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries confirms that PRP is significantly more used in contexts with clear separation of interests between politicians and senior civil servants.

AB In this article we study the recent phenomenon of the individualized civic watch emerging on the Internet. 'Civic watch' from below allows people to monitor elites and organizations in order to make their actions more transparent, fair and accountable. The use of information and communication technologies increases the ability of people to publish information regarding the unethical behaviour or mishandling of governments, civil servants, public office holders, the police, etc. We study the individualized civic watch facilitated by computer mediated communication in the frame of reflexive political action. Reflexive politics refers to politicized personal matters and it departs on the basis of individualized responsibility-taking. The Internet provides a cheap tool that empowers an individual and offers an opportunity to create personal news deliverance that influences mainstream news providers and the media. The individualized use of the Internet stresses the new,forms of political activity that might cause the renaissance of personalized politicization. Through the Internet it is possible to offer 'official truth challenging' viewpoints on political campaigns and gain access to more personalized information than ever before, which may even reach a global audience. In regard to that we study individualized usage of the Internet. Such innovative forms of action are,,for instance, Web Hogging and multi-directional narrow-/broadcasting through YouTube.

I argue that this animating spirit has its roots in the first-hand exposure of UNRRA personnel to the destruction wrought by the war, and in the personal rapport UNRRA officials established with their Soviet counterparts. Meanwhile, a strong reaction against multilaterally administered relief arose in the USA, forcing the organization to vigorously defend its performance. In response, UNRRA staff rejected the politicization of relief and became more committed to the broader goal of strengthening international institutions in order to address global problems. UNRRA staff concluded that the impartiality of international relief work should be protected as a vital asset in alleviating human suffering. As today's humanitarian workers face an increasing threat of violence in places like Afghanistan and Sudan, the lessons on UNRRA's experience are worth remembering.

AB This essay explores the rise and decline of regulatory independence in Turkey. Framing the ongoing process of limiting independence of these agencies as the politics of de-delegation, it raises the question of why Turkish regulatory agencies have become subject to increasing political intervention. Contending that institutional legacies and mounting illiberal predispositions of the Turkish state facilitate the politics of de-delegation, the essay focuses on centralization, executive discretion, and politicization of bureaucracy as the major institutional legacies. Then it briefly discusses formal and informal mechanisms of political intervention, which have impaired the independence of the regulatory agencies.

ID MANAGEMENT; GOVERNMENT; PART
AB The most important administrative aspect of the George W. Bush presidency was not its formal management reform agenda, but its attempt to extend the politicized presidency. Efforts to assert tighter political control of the federal bureaucracy, revived during the Ronald Reagan administration, were pursued to an extreme under Bush. Loyalty triumphed over competence in selection, and political goals displaced rationality in decision making. However, the strategy of politicization undermined the Bush administration's own policy goals as well as its broader agenda to restore the strength of the institutional presidency. This apparent failure of strategy signals the urgent necessity for a fundamental reconsideration of the politicized presidency.

DE Policing; Police Reform; Stability Maintenance; Crime; China
AB As President Xi Jinping expands and deepens his mark on the Chinese political system, how should scholars assess the impact of his administration on core institutions such as the police? This article employs a mixed methods approach by combining data from interview research with text analysis of ministerial level documents to explore reforms and rhetoric in the public security bureaucracy during the first six years of Xi's tenure. The timing, nature, and practical execution of police reform shed light on the priorities of the Xi administration and its ability to make changes to the police bureaucracy and enforce law and order in Chinese cities. The paper assesses key policing reform rhetoric using Jean-Paul Brodeur's framework of high and low policing to analyze which areas of policing have received the most attention and in what ways. Ultimately, I find that preferences for "high policing" style stability maintenance reforms supersede concern for "low policing" activities such as crime-fighting, resulting in the further politicization of policing in China.

ID MANAGEMENT; SEEKING; POWER
AB Several critical studies in accounting have approached the introduction of accounting systems in the public sector in terms of enforcing and sustaining competition-based resource allocation mechanisms. In this study, we reverse the question and ask: why has accounting not been used in certain public bureaucracies as much as it might? We investigate the extent to which accounting systems have been used in the management of the Greek National Health System (ESY) and find that accounting has played a marginal role in its development. Attempting to explain this puzzling feature we first note and then contrast the main underlying features of accounting systems with those of the Greek political system in general, and ESY in particular Briefly, our explanation is that the historically high politicization that has characterized the Greek political system has tended to overshadow the economic-cum-managerial dimension of running public bureaucracies, favouring overtly political evaluation criteria of organizational and individual performance. In such an institutional environment, accounting has low symbolic significance and its use does not contribute to enhancing organizational legitimacy - hence its marginal role.

TI Agency Characteristics and the Use of Executive Orders
SO CONGRESS & THE PRESIDENCY-A JOURNAL OF CAPITAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSTRAINTS; PRESIDENCY; POWERS
AB Past scholarship has offered varying explanations for why presidents choose to use executive orders. However, to this point, much of what we know of unilateral powers does not adequately address the role the bureaucracy plays in the president's decision. This research seeks to account for bureaucratic factors as a strategic presidential consideration in the employment of such directives. I classify executive orders from 1989-2012 based on which agency or agencies they apply to, and consider the importance of various characteristics (e.g. agency ideology, level of centralization, politicization, etc.) in determining which organs of the bureaucracy presidents will direct executive orders to generally. The results provide evidence that the White House directs fewer executive orders to agencies that have a politically independent leadership structure, and this result holds across a variety of measures judging an order's impact. The results demonstrate that the type of directive is crucial in determining a president's strategic decision to use executive orders, in line with previous research, and that agency centralization is one crucial component of this strategic calculation.

AB State capacity is central to the provision of public goods, including environmental protection. Drawing on climate policy making, this article argues that the division of labor between the bureaucracy and legislature in policy formulation is a critical source of state capacity. In cases of bureaucratic policy design, the legislature sets policy goals and delegates policy design to bureaucracies. This division of labor shifts distributional conflict to autonomous bureaucracies, allowing for effective policy design. California followed this path in climate policy making, setting it on track to meet climate goals. In cases of legislative policy design, bureaucracies set goals and legislatures design policy measures. Since legislators have incentives to respond to vested interests, legislative policy design is vulnerable to regulatory capture. In Germany, legislative policy design in climate policy making is preventing attainment of emissions reduction goals, as industry interests succeeded in blocking key policy measures. Our findings highlight procedural sources of state capacity.

AB This article discusses the politicization of the bureaucratic structures of the Brazilian municipalities based on appointed positions. The intention is to demonstrate patterns of political appointments that reflect institutional performance. The data were provided by Munic/IBGE 2005/14 and IpoC- Mstituicoes Politicas Comparadas/UFRGS. Firstly, the study observed the degree of variability of the distribution of these positions in municipal structures, and the quality of the appointees' education. Then, an analysis of spatial, global, and local dependence was performed. In addition, the difference in performance among municipalities was statistically tested using the independent t-test. The test compared municipalities' performance concerning the number and education of appointees. The study used the Municipal GDP-Per-Capita, the Indice Firjan de Desenvolvimento Municipal (IFDM), and the Indice de Governanca Municipal (IGM) created by the Federal Board of Administration as proxies for performance. The results stress the complexity of local public management since some of the tests indicate the number and education of appointees as predictors of high performance while other studies do not find the same relationship.

AB This paper is an exploratory study that investigates the status of New Public Management (NPM) and the obstacles to its implementation within the Republic of Lebanon. The study employs a qualitative approach that examines two complementary data sources. The first data source is obtained from an extensive review of documents related to new public management that are available in the public domain such as policy initiatives and governmental projects. The second data source is obtained from in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 public managers. The data collected is analyzed, using an iterative thematic content analysis. The findings suggest that the main obstacles that have inhibited the implementation of new public management in most public agencies in Lebanon include; the politicization of administration in the public sector, the lack of stability in the country, the non-targeted, inconsistent and insufficient training, institutional dysfunctions and organizational challenges, the absence of a country specific applicable model of public management and the unsystematic and non-institutionalized link between concerned international organizations and the Lebanese public agencies. This research is significant as it provides a foundation for the institutions' practices to improve the design and implementation of new public management in the country. This research not only contributes to the relevant literature but also provides policy recommendations needed to respond, to the recurrent calls for administrative reforms in the Arab world.

DE Third Republic; France; Conseil d'Etat; Congregations; Legal Fiction;

AB The Congregational dispute was one of the most violent episodes in the secular clash of the Third Republic. It was mainly settled by the law of 1 July 1901 whose application was entrusted to the Council of State (Conseil d'Etat). The analysis of its general assembly highlights, grounded on the combination of members' positions and biographical data, the confrontation of two camps. Catholic defenders of congregations use "legal fiction" strategies to maintain the existence of religious companies. The Council of State, although subject to a duty of reserve and to an obligation of neutrality, became for a few years a discreet political arena. This politicization is limited by the sense of duty of high civil servants who manage to reconcile the demands of their service with an hidden opposition. This survey stresses some of the features of a Catholic interpretation of the law, which seeks to recognize the spontaneous life of institutions instead of coercing it. It also shows the strategies of an institution to maintain itself in a hostile political context. The Council has found its balance within the new republican institutions by arranging the cohabitation of the new republican law with the law of the preceding political regimes. The Conseil d'Etat was responsible for deciding on the life or death of religious institutions, and organizes its own survival by taking life sparingly and seeking harmony of jurisprudence everywhere.

DT Article
DE ADMINISTRATION; FRENCH REVOLUTION; CONSTITUTION; EXECUTIVE;
   POLITICIZATION; DOMINATION
AB The history of the French state has long been overwhelmed by a teleological vision initiated by nineteenth-century liberal writers and emphasizing the long centralizing continuum between monarchic absolutism, "Jacobin" centralization, the Empire and the succession of nineteenth-century political regimes. Following this logic, territorial administration, studied both by historiography and by theorists of classical law, was a fundamental instrument in the long "conquest" of the centre over its peripheries. As an organ of political power, local administration would have had the role of executor and relay between the central power and the provinces/departments, reflecting the binary nature of a pyramidal link composed of subordination and/or contestation. Thus, the modernisation of the state and the growth of the administrative bureaucracy were linked in a joint quest for efficiency and rationality. However, the administrative project of the revolutionaries of 1789, in other words their political conception of the territory, reflects an entirely different logic. Indeed, insofar as the law was envisaged by the first Constituents as the perfect translation of the general will resulting from the sovereignty of the people, its execution was theoretically based on popular consent, which could not be a constraint, even if negotiated. In short, the constitutional project of the early Revolution can be seen as an alternative to the modernising vulgate of the 19th century and as an original political thought that renews the link between sovereignty and territory through the regeneration of the territorial executive power thought as the implementation of political freedom.

AB No one can deny the importance of policy advice in the affairs of the government but the actual role played by consultants in policymaking is poorly understood and little researched, particularly in developing countries where data are scarce. This article is an initial attempt at examining the demand for policy consulting in a developing country. It sought to confirm whether the trends in policy advice externalization and proceduralization - found in developed countries are present in an emerging economy such as the Philippines based on an extensive coding and analysis of a recently made public database of bid notices for consulting services. The study confirms that the demand for external policy advice is growing in Philippines, as expected from a government of a developing country. The proceduralization hypothesis of externalizing process-related work is partially confirmed but strategic policy advice is also found to be important where the government almost equally also outsources substantive, highly specialized advice. However, administrative politicization is not observed in this data set. A new category of advice is also generated - training - to capture demands of the bureaucracy to delivery advice expeditiously through workshops facilitated by experts.

First, it shows the crucial, yet unobtrusive, role played by feminist actors in the process, in spite of the absence of any strong open politicization of the issue, from agenda setting to implementation. Second, the article points to the dual character of the reform. On the one hand, the gradual character and limited perimeter of the quota (to senior executive "initial appointments") restricted its immediate quantitative impact. On the other hand, the constraining, technical dimension of the tool endowed it with a potential to foster incremental social change.

ID SINGLE-PARTY; VOTE; POLITICS
AB In electorally contested regimes, the incumbent party often uses clientelist exchanges to stay in power long after its underlying electoral support has evaporated. Existing studies failed to examine how the role of clientelism changes with the increasing tenure of the incumbent party. Combining data from the Afrobarometer project and information about partisan turnover, this article shows that the longer a party has remained in power, the more clientelist exchanges in the form of club goods and patronage will serve to bolster popular support for the ruling party. This is mainly because lengthy party duration facilitates the politicization of bureaucracy and other state resources essential for clientelist exchanges. Understanding the evolving role of clientelism under electoral contestation has profound implications for the study of phenomena such as dominant-party rule and democratic erosion.

AB The ongoing debate over indigenous claims to intellectual and cultural property reveals a series of indigenous strategies of mobilization that both appropriate from and work against the logic of the market. Of particular significance in this regard are the various indigenous strategies used in contemporary pharmaceutical bioprospecting activities to address claims to traditional medical knowledge as cultural property. This article presents field data on a controversial ethnopharmaceutical project among the Aguaruna of Peru's high forest and offers a comparative analysis of the outcomes with attention to several other cases in and beyond South America. In particular, questions are raised about the forms of legitimating authority in the burgeoning international indigenous movement, the role of NGOs, researchers, bureaucracies, and corporations in this process, and the dilemmas that emerge from the politicization and privatization of indigenous culture and identity.

DT Article
AB The article examines the introduction of socialist name giving ceremonies in the GDR in order to pose broader questions about church-state relations and the politicization of everyday life in the late 1950s. Based on extensive archival material, the article focuses on the contingencies often obscured by historical narratives that treat socialist rites of passage as mere substitutes for church rites. An analysis of the deliberations of party officials and state bureaucracies about the name giving ceremony reveals a complex of trial and error and experimentation and a series of unanswered questions about the specific meaning of the new ritual. Unlike the socialist confirmation, the Jugendweihe, which fulfilled a concrete function in the political education of the youth and received continuous state support, the name giving ceremony sheds a different light on the socialist state as an altogether reluctant participant in ritual practices.

DT Article
DE foreign policy; diplomacy; politics; bureaucracy; diplomatic service;
   Romania; reform
AB As a highly specialized and relatively small sized public service (in terms of staff and bud-get), diplomacy has always been in a particular position within the administrative system of most countries. Not only does diplomacy attract the pretended elites of the public sectors employ-ees but also a lot of popular criticism with regard to its performances, transparency, dedication to public interest, procedures of recruitment, privileges, and sometimes moral exigencies. This paradoxical ambivalence of elitism and public distrust coexists with variable degrees of tension between politicization and the need of effective technocracy. This article explores the concepts, delimitations and functioning of the po-litical-ideological vs. administrative components of diplomatic systems, in the wider context of the administrative paradigms and political cultures to which they belong. While the theoretical distinc-tion between foreign policy and diplomacy is way more developed in European classical approach-es, though with controversial results, the Ameri-can authors and offcials traditionally use the two concepts interchangeably. Notwithstanding this theoretical fexibility, the borderline between the political level of diplomatic representation and the professional diplomatic and consular corps is clearer and better regulated in the U.S. sys-tem than in most of the European countries. A case study focused on the reform of the Roma-nian diplomatic service, in the pre- and post-EU accession years, serves as empirical analysis of this demarche.

AB In Iran, restructuring of medical education and the health care delivery system in 1985 resulted in a rapid shift from elite to mass education, ultimately leading to an increase in the number of medical schools, faculties, and programs and as well as some complications. This study aimed to investigate views on academic culture, values, and routines held by faculty members. A nation-wide survey conducted in six public medical schools in Iran. The research findings show weak organizational culture and values, together with routine behaviors sensed as a negative and low satisfaction with academic leadership. The research evidence suggests bureaucracy, politicization, conservativeness, and centralization as common features of medical schools in Iran and also suggests suitable supervisory skills to tackle the tension between governmental management and academic leadership with cultural changes, the creation of new values, and adoption more efficient routines.

LA English
DT Article
ID DEMOCRACY; BUREAUCRACY; POLITICS
AB Facilitation of connectedness has been a fundamental role of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) and the Public Administration Review (PAR) throughout their six decades of professional service. Together they have sought to link practitioners and academicians across subfields and varied levels of activities. As a foremost refereed journal, PAR has sought to encourage the linking of practice and theory through timely publication of methodologically disciplined research, informed analyses and commentaries, and constructive literature reviews and correspondence. These responsibilities have been persistently challenging. ASPA and PAR have served a dynamic field that has made some wrong turns and had others forced on it, resulting in failed autonomy, followed by increasing partisan politicization of governments and reduced reliance on professionally expert administration. For ASPA, it has created leadership and membership problems. For PAR, if has sometimes exacerbated difficulties in connecting practitioners and academicians, but it has also created more shared concerns as important subjects of inquiry. Challenges now are to serve both enduring and new spheres of the field that are afforded by international and domestic developments. Both ASPA and PAR are striving to do that. Globalization of public administration opens a world of opportunities today Localization, as a fundamental of constitutional democracy, is a priority internationally, presenting an engaging paradox of global attention to both place and planet. That is linked in this commentary to the classic democracy-bureaucracy quandary that has constructively challenged public administration. While arrays of other important subjects, old and new, need to command attention in PAR, these are linked in this analysis to today's theory and practice of interdependent facilitative states to assess how the journal serves its responsibilities.

ID IDEOLOGY; DURATION; POWERS; SENATE
AB Agency budgets are recognized as strong conditioning influences on executive nominations and, by extension, bureaucratic politicization. Key is an appointed position with greater budgetary authority attached being more important. Yet, position importance has been measured broadly-for example, distinguishing among appointment tiers-without incorporating discretionary budgets as a more nuanced measure. We rectify this, assessing hypotheses about how a position's discretionary budget impacts the president's nomination choice and the Senate's responses. As expected, higher budgets are associated with presidents nominating those with whom they are more in tune ideologically, but this effect is mitigated for top-tier appointments. Also as predicted, the Senate moves these high budget appointments through the process more smoothly with higher approval likelihoods. Budgets are a key element of position importance for department-level agencies, structuring how presidents choose and the Senate reacts in politicizing the bureaucracy.

AB In this article, the authors seek to address the singular forms of the State in the French overseas territories. It explores the original historical construction and strengthening of both State interventions and bureaucratic domination in these territories. While drawing up an overview of the existing scholarship, the authors seek to look at the colonial legacies while paying attention to both the variety of the decolonization processes and their complex temporalities in the overseas territories. Instead of naturalizing the so-called "specificity" of political interventions and the State in these territories, they look at the various forms of mobilizations that contribute to frame them as "singular" or "exceptional". The authors also argue that the evolution of such framing is closely related to processes of politicization and depoliticization. Finally, building on the street -level bureaucracy scholarship, they look at the practical dimensions of state action and administrative encounters.

AB This study explains the adoption of the National Childcare and Development Network in Costa Rica using John Kingdon's multiple streams approach. Traditionally, the literature on social policies argues that in the presence of socioeconomic transformations and pressures from women's movements and from left or center-left governments, the adoption of care policies is more likely to happen. Yet, Costa Rica adopted its care policy during a fiscal crisis, with a lack of demands for care policies from the women's movement, and with a right-wing party in government. Drawing data from documents and semistructured interviews, this article demonstrates the applicability of the multiple streams approach to understand care policy-making processes in developing countries. The study finds that the multiple streams approach effectively explains the adoption of the policy as the product of top-down decisions from the national women's agency that constructs the problem, a close-knit policy design led by technocrats and bureaucrats, and the politicization of care policies to gain electoral support.

AB This paper explores how an array of HIV epidemic responders became embroiled in producing quantitative evidence for HIV interventions in India. Based upon extensive ethnographic fieldwork in Karnataka State, I examine the life history of the Gates-funded AIDS initiative in India known as Avahan as a case study to consider the social and political implications of large-scale, standardizing knowledge regimes enacted in the era of global health. Specifically, I analyze a sample of the key material artifacts that are implicated in the production of standardized knowledge in an attempt to illuminate the workings of what I refer to as evidentiary sovereignty'. I argue that documents, forms, and other paperwork used to generate evidence in global health interventions neither merely reflect expert knowledge nor convey information about scientific standards but, rather, are integral to the re-instantiation of sovereignty. The effects of evidentiary sovereignty not only narrow the aperture of global health interventions to overlook the on-the-ground realities that shape health problems, but they also transform the very ground upon which communities responding to HIV epidemics conceive of and enact politics. As highly HIV-affected communities struggle with the bureaucratic demands of intensive form-filling and query agreed upon standards and systems of classification, a form of politicization of knowledge unfurls that pertains to the documents themselves.

AB This article studies how administrations seek to shape the federal workforce through the budget process. I develop a theory of personnel politics in which presidents balance ideological and interest group demands in distributing human resources across the federal government. I argue administrations advantage organizations with which they are ideologically aligned and that agencies with higher levels of union penetration see increased budgeted personnel levels, particularly during Democratic presidencies. Using an original dataset of budgeted personnel levels from fiscal years (FY) 1983-2016 and a series of regression analyses, I find strong support for these hypotheses. I also examine the sensitivity of presidential strategy to congressional preferences, agency professionalization, and leadership politicization, providing insights into how this control strategy interacts with the broader environment. Overall, these results have implications for understanding the political dynamics of human capital and capacity in the federal bureaucracy, the administrative presidency, and the politics of performance in federal agencies.

In particular, this article looks at the development of an efficient tax-gathering apparatus, showing how the revenue board, the most pervasive agency of the eighteenth-century Irish state, extracted increasing levels of taxation from a sometimes hostile population. Drawing extensively on the records of the Irish revenue commissioners, a very rich if under utilized source, it demonstrates for the first time the levels of taxation raised in Ireland, while also exploring how these taxes were collected. It concludes that this period saw the expansion of an increasingly professional bureaucracy, challenging existing interpretations that have focused predominantly on politicization. The final section looks at issues of evasion and compliance, showing the difficulties faced by the Irish state in this period, as it expanded deeper into Irish society.

AB The article notes that the theme of culture and cultural policy for modern Iran is not a marginal issue. Culture is seen by the country's leadership as an important component of its state political and ideological doctrine. There is analyzed the role of the Islamic factor and cultural heritage in the cultural policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran over four decades of its existence. In this context, particular attention is paid to the role of the theory of the dialogue of civilizations proposed by M. Khatami as well as to the changing attitude towards it in the public consciousness of Iranian society, depending on the situation that is developing both inside Iran and around it in the international arena. It is emphasized that the theme of "Iran and the West", which has a long tradition in the cultural discourse and attracts the attention of both government officials and the general public, is becoming particularly acute in the country today, contributing to its politicization. An attempt is being made to show that Iranian culture is increasingly becoming an important factor in the foreign policy activities of the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran, contributing to the strengthening of the country's position in the world arena as a whole and the country's leading role in the region, the realization of the idea of exporting the Islamic Revolution and implementing Iranian cultural expansion outside the country.

The introduction to the special issue briefly outlines existing scholarship on policy advisory systems and identifies different research gaps to the filling of which the special issue seeks to contribute. The introduction highlights that the articles in the special issue point to both political system and policy process variables to better systemize, theorize and explain the origins and change dynamics of policy advisory systems.

AB Ministers increasingly rely on advisers for support and advice. In many countries, these political aides are labelled differently. Generally, they serve as close confidants to their political masters and operate in the 'shadowland' between politics and bureaucracy. Scholarship has dragged the ministerial advisers out of the dark and described their background and functions. Still, the field of scholarship has a Westminster bias, is characterized by single case studies, and remains under-theorized. The lack of comparative focus and theoretical underpinnings can be explained by the complex nature of ministerial advisers. This introductory article suggests a definition for ministerial advisers and reviews the extant literature on these important actors. The main argument is that the extent and relevance of ministerial advisers in executive government merits integration into mainstream public administration and political science theory and research.

AB With the increased politicization of agency rulemaking and the reduced cost of participating in the notice-and-comment rulemaking process, administrative agencies have, in recent years, found themselves deluged in a flood of public comments. In this Article, we argue that this deluge presents both challenges and opportunities, and we explore how advances in natural language processing technologies can help agencies address the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities created by the recent growth of public participation in the regulatory process. We also examine how scholars of public bureaucracies can use this important new publicly available data to better understand how agencies interact with the public. To illustrate the value of these new tools, we carry out computational text analysis of nearly three million public comments that were received by administrative agencies over the course of the Obama administration. Our findings indicate that advances in natural language processing technology show great promise for both researchers and policymakers who are interested in understanding, and improving, regulatory decision-making.

ID CRIME; JUVENILES; REALITY; RECORD
AB This article examines the way in which the construction of a "gang" problem and the resulting "gang statistics" in a particular community, referred to as Bigcity, are related to the local political context and the police accommodation of political interests. In particular, the political accountability of the police impacts on police recordkeeping practices and the statistics regarding "gangs" that those records generate. The organizational career of Sang statistics, from the citizen's call to the police response and subsequent recordwork, is examined in order to demonstrate how the recordkeeping practices of the police bureaucracy facilitate the social construction of the "gang" problem. Field research data, including calls to the police, ride-along observations, and interviews, illustrate how the politicization of the "gang" problem impacts on police recordkeeping and the social construction of "gang statistics." Given that the current concern about the nationwide growth of gangs is based on such statistics and that gang suppression efforts call for enhancing and sharing gang databases, the role of police practices in shaping gang statistics is an important issue.

SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES

DT Article
ID NETHERLANDS
AB A system of adequately performing public bureaucracies is a basic requirement for developing countries to progress and prosper. However, public management in developing countries is often threatened by politicization and ineffective human resource management policies. In this article, we analyse public management in Eritrea, one of the world's poorest countries that gained independence in the early 1990s. In this analysis, we use general (western) theoretical frames of reference, including pre-modern, weberian and new public management lines of thinking. It will show that, in current Eritrea, all known styles of public management concur and collide and that this situation is related to the cultural, educational and political background of the various population groups that strive for job opportunities in the public sector's strategic apex. This collision of styles may lead to frustration and ineffectiveness among the people involved. Only a managerial policy stressing practical wisdom and intelligence may satisfy all the groups of people engaged in Eritrea's public management, in fact in all developing countries' public organizations.

AB The analysis we propose aims at identifying those limitations of the acts of knowledge that have emerged under the pressure of bureaucracy and politicization of institutions that administer public knowledge-the school at all levels, research centers, academies, etc. It seems of first urgency to examine without prejudice some topics such as:
   1) knowledge and the institutions that manage it. We note the institutionalization of the forms of the procedural unfolding of knowledge and the standardization of the narratives that express it. This fact has social consequences that are easy to identify: no knowledge (truth) is recognized unless it enters the circuit of the institutions that manage the knowledge networks and alternative narratives (to the standard ones) develop epistemologically relevant effects only when they arc allocated relevant expression space (the institutional mechanisms of authoritarian imposition block any attempt at non-conforming discourse).
   2) formal narratives of knowledge and their political function prove the entry of the sciences into the circuit of the economy of7mbolic goods. In social practice, the mutual negotiation between the various forms of public authority and the (compliant) education systems is transparent. Public education puts into circulation metanarratives about science that have an implicit ideological dimension.

DT Editorial Material
DE refugees; welcome; care; labour; feminist geography
AB Drawing on my recent research with aid workers in Jordan and Lebanon, as well as on examples from Greece and Italy, in this commentary I propose the concept of care work as one of the possible ways to achieve a grounded critical understanding of welcome, one that goes beyond solidarity versus institutionalization, bureaucracy versus generosity and state versus civil society dichotomies. Framing the issue in such a way means asking three fundamental questions: not only, as Gill poignantly does, what is welcome, but also where is welcome actually located and, most importantly, who welcomes. These questions illuminate the many overlooked forms of affective and physical labour without which state-centred, institutional, and internationally organized aid and "welcome" would not be possible. The task, I contend, is to unearth the labour of care that the governance of migration and refuge requires, labour that is mostly feminized, racialized, and precarious. By illuminating the forms of care and interdependencies upon which the reproduction of our societies depends - in all its aspects, including border regimes - this perspective opens up an emancipatory pathway to the politicization of welcoming and aid to migrants and refugees, alternative to humanitarian discourses.

ID ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES; PORK BARREL; POLICY; POWER; LEGISLATURES;
   PRESIDENT; ECONOMY; LAW
AB Although historical debates about the separation of powers focus on Congress, the President, and the Judiciary, in modern times, the bureaucracy is the elephant in the room. In a world of seemingly inevitable widespread congressional delegation to administrative agencies, as well as the Supreme Court's blessing of independent agencies, how exactly is the fourth branch of government to be controlled? The canonical answer in administrative law, constitutional law, and political science, is agency design. By carefully selecting structural features of administrative agencies and requiring the use of specific decision-making procedures for policy making, the legislature and the executive can ensure responsive and accountable bureaucracy-or so the argument goes. As Congress continues to create ever more agencies using ever more variations in institutional structure, and as the Supreme Court continues to grapple with which features of administrative are constitutional, the stakes of these conceptual debates have risen steadily. Indeed, we are in the midst of something of an agency design renaissance-a time period of fundamental change with respect to the federal bureaucracy-deriving mainly, although not exclusively, from the emergence of new administrative forms.
   Unfortunately, there is virtually no empirical scholarship that demonstrates a link between agency design and political responsiveness or agency behavior. This is due not to a lack of attention but to a fundamental problem of research design and the institutional landscape of administrative agencies. To address this question, scholars have studied individual agencies to document political influence exerted by Congress or the president in a specific policy domain. Such studies of individual agencies are important, but also analytically incapable of identifying the role of agency design in political responsiveness for two reasons. First, the relevant institutional features almost never vary within a single agency. Second, most policy outputs-where one would look to see evidence of political control-are not readily comparable across agencies. As a consequence, there has been little quantitative scholarship that establishes a link between agency design and a similar agency output across agencies or over time. This Essay focuses on an activity common to and comparable across many agencies-the distribution of federal moneys-to answer one of the most basic questions for agency design. We show that a prominent structural feature of agency design - the extent of high-level personnel politicization-affects the degree of political responsiveness by agencies

DT Article
AB The rise of conservative populism in Canada is evident with the election of Stephen Harper and the Conservative leadership race. Aspects of those campaigns are focused on a fear of otherness, a resentment of elites (including bureaucrats), and an emphasis on self-interest This paper will focus on populist policies and actions introduced during Stephen Harper's tenure in government Many of these policies were directed specifically towards the public service including the reduction of public servants, unilateral changes to labour laws, and the politicization of the public service through a proposed niqab ban. While the influence of populist conservative policies caused noticeable resentments between public servants and the Conservative Party, public servants should reconsider their position within democracy as not focused on their compatibility with the government of the day, but rather with their adherence to the values of inclusion, fairness, and neutrality. The public service must constantly adapt to the will of the political branch of government including more populist governments; however these core values should be celebrated through active implementation and leadership to aid in the development of a positive relationship with both the political arm of government and the public more broadly. These values provide a means for individual public servants to invest their motivation into values that they can treat as fundamental to their role in democracy.

LA English
DT Book Review
AB On April 20, 2008, Paraguay elected rural bishop Fernando Lugo as its president, ending the reign of the Colorado party that had ruled the country since 1947. The election spurred a political shift to the left and considerably transformed the relationship that the national soy industry had forged with the state bureaucracy in previous decades. Progressives, intellectuals, and activists became employed by the same legal apparatus they had protested against for years. Correspondingly, public institutions that had been partly built by the soy industry were suddenly staffed by some of the sector's most ardent critics. In The Government of Beans, Kregg Hetherington explores this peculiar political juncture so as to offer wider reflections on governance in the Anthropocene. To this end, he relies on 17 short chapters that are grouped into three parts. Part I (Cast of Characters) presents us with the people and plants that the book is about. Over the course of six chapters, Hetherington historicizes the conjectures that laid the groundwork for the emergence of soy and its politicization, guiding us past, among others, the Stroessner dictatorship, cotton-growing colonists, soy-growing colonists displacing the earlier cotton growers, herbicides, Roundup Ready beans, the present-absent state, and 1990s neoliberalization.

AB The international tax system developed as a form of technocratic governance, aimed at facilitating international investment, neglecting provisions for cooperation between national governments for tax enforcement. Its endogenous flaws resulted in its politicization in the 1970s, and again in the 1990s, leading to an increasingly technicized form of global governance. The great financial crisis was even more disruptive and accelerated a shift toward increasingly volatile interactions between the spheres of technocracy and politics. Complex global problems requiring long time-horizons are dealt with by increasingly narrowly focused technical specialists, dominated by corporatized bureaucracies operating in public-private symbiosis; while in the sphere of politics, a wider public seeks simple solutions and mistrusts experts, with good reason given the experience of regulatory failures, often due to the capture of regulation by private interests. Instant communication favors opinion-formers claiming authority, while representative democracy has shifted to "audience representation," opening the way for demagogue leaders, as well as clientelism and corruption. While the financial crisis opened up possibilities for a paradigm shift in international tax governance, the tensions in both the technocratic and political spheres, as well as the growing gap between them, make it hard to achieve a stable and effective outcome.

AB These days political advisors are indispensable to state administration. They are appointed to their positions to advise ministers and the prime minister on public policy, various political aspects and coordination, or on public relations and aspects of communication. Their appointments depend on the minister's term of office. Political advisors are not part of the civil service and different states take different approaches, if any at all, to regulating their status. The need for political advisors arises in conjunction with changes in management, the need to strengthen coordination, leadership and strategy, as well as the need to address a growing intensity of communication. Political advisors constitute a new factor in the dynamic between politicians and civil servants, and they bring about changes in the relationship between politics and administration. They generate a mistrust among the general public, due to a lack of transparency and accountability, as well as the fact that, as a rule, their position is governed by specific regulations, if any at all. Conflict of interest, in particular, is a cause for concern. The paper examines the reasons why political advisors may become key members of ministerial cabinets, analyses the concept of the political advisor and their various types and functions, and describes the consequences and key elements of the concept. Trends in some countries are also included.

AB The article discusses the evolution of the Visegrad partnership. It never had integrative capacity, but in recent years accumulated the integration potential in regional relations. The common position formation principles in international policy are being carried out by the Visegrad Four. Notable is the emergence of really important issues and explicit politicization of the agenda. The defense theme, the problem of energy security, coordination of positions on the EU budget etc. were included into discussions. At the same time, exacerbated contradictions exist in these areas. Key factors currently affecting the development of the Visegrad Group are: the confrontation of great powers in the region, the inert nature of relationship between the Visegrad countries and the United States, the anarchy in European policy, the prevalence of extra-regional conditions and incentives, the lack of specific regional rules and the void of its institutionalization. The Ukrainian crisis once again emphasizes the importance of the regional policy external actors - the U.S., Germany, Russia and the Brussels EU bureaucracy. It was the cause of the schism emerging in East European politics, and slowed down the process of the intra-regional incentives formation as well as of the communications concentration. It is forcing the Visegrad countries to grasp their limitrophe position. A perspective of the Visegrad partnership is unclear, but it is noteworthy that regional relations become increasingly important for their participants.

TI Requirements for effective academic leadership in Iran: A Nominal Group
   Technique exercise
SO BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICAL-EDUCATION
AB Background: During the last two decades, medical education in Iran has shifted from elite to mass education, with a considerable increase in number of schools, faculties, and programs. Because of this transformation, it is a good case now to explore academic leadership in a non-western country. The objective of this study was to explore the views on effective academic leadership requirements held by key informants in Iran's medical education system.
   Methods: A nominal group study was conducted by strategic sampling in which participants were requested to discuss and report on requirements for academic leadership, suggestions and barriers. Written notes from the discussions were transcribed and subjected to content analysis.
   Results: Six themes of effective academic leadership emerged: 1) shared vision, goal, and strategy, 2) teaching and research leadership, 3) fair and efficient management, 4) mutual trust and respect, 5) development and recognition, and 6) transformational leadership. Current Iranian academic leadership suffers from lack of meritocracy, conservative leaders, politicization, bureaucracy, and belief in misconceptions.
   Conclusion: The structure of the Iranian medical university system is not supportive of effective academic leadership. However, participants' views on effective academic leadership are in line with what is also found in the western literature, that is, if the managers could create the premises for a supportive and transformational leadership, they could generate mutual trust and respect in academia and increase scientific production.

TI Mandarins or managers? The bureaucratic elite in Bonn, 1970 to 1987 and
   beyond
SO GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Overall, within the broad descriptive framework of the comparative-elites study, the special impact of New Public Management (NPM) on the German federal government is considered, but judged marginal. The mandarin status of the administrative elite prevails, despite a long-term decrease in the share of jurists and more open career patterns, both due to a first managerialist turn in the 1970s. It is argued that new administrative policies are carried out like any other substantive policy. On the polity dimension, the bureaucracy's function as the center of expertise is reflected in terms of both formal education and subjective role understanding. On the policy dimension, the 1970 reformist agenda of the Brandt government resulted in higher programmatic commitment than at the point of replication of the base line study in 1987, when the Kohl government was consolidating public finances. Under conditions such as those prevailing after national unification in 1990 and since about 1995, though, top administrators can turn quite managerial. The most significant change is observed on the politics dimension: growing party politicization of the administrative elite, in particular after fundamental government changes (1969, 1982, 1998) examined here. Functional as it may be for streamlining the ministries, the extent of party patronage may, in the long run, undermine the still-high trust in executive institutions in Germany.

AB Why do parties appoint outsiders and experts to ministerial positions? Extant research offers explanations based on institutional arrangements and external shocks (e.g. political or economic crises). We go beyond such system-level variables to argue that the characteristics of ministerial appointees are a function of the portfolio they are being appointed to. Drawing on theories of political delegation, we argue that outsider and expert appointments to ministerial office are affected by a portfolio's policy jurisdiction, its financial resources and appointment powers, and the partisan leanings of the ministerial bureaucracy. We test these arguments on all appointments of senior and junior ministers in Austria between 1945 and 2020. The analysis shows that outsiders are more likely to be appointed to ministries with greater party support in the bureaucracy, while experts are more likely appointed to portfolios dealing with high-salience issues.

TI Sociological knowledge and colonial power in Bombay around the First
   World War
SO BRITISH JOURNAL FOR THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB By the turn of the twentieth century a distinct 'social domain' - along with its constituent parts, problems and internal dynamics - was turned into a political entity, and a concern for state bureaucracies existed across the industrializing world. Specific motivations for this trend may have varied from location to location, but included arguments for higher industrial productivity and less political discontent, often intertwined with a humanitarian impulse in calls for better housing, expanded public health or improved working conditions. As has been well documented, the politicization of the social domain in early twentieth-century Britain owes much to the consolidation of British sociology as a distinct discipline. Yet while the link between the rise of social politics and sociology has been established with regard to Britain, little has been said about the occurrence of this coupling elsewhere in the twentieth-century British Empire. This article aims to rectify that omission by showing the interplay between newly raised social concerns of the colonial administration in the Bombay Presidency, Western British India, and the establishing of sociological research within the borders of the Presidency around the time of the First World War. The article will explore how the colonial administration in Bombay planned to meet new demands for sociological knowledge in colonial state policy, how sociology was subsequently introduced into the Presidency as a research subject, and how new sociological methods were applied in actual colonial government.

ID SATISFACTION; GOVERNMENT; DIVERSITY; STATE
AB Citizen trust in public institutions is an indication of successful governance as it has often been viewed as an important element of good governance. Citizen distrust in government and its institutions considerably affects the effectiveness and efficiency of public policies and their implementation. Since the independence, Sri Lanka has been regarded as a third world democracy with a strong welfare state system in which public institutions have played pivotal role in fostering democracy and citizen trust. Nevertheless, in the recent past, citizen trust in most public institutions has been alarmingly decreasing owing to politicization of public sector, service delivery, political and bureaucratic corruption, lack of transparency, accountability, ethnic prejudice and partiality in the working of the public institutions. In this backdrop, this paper examines the level of citizen trust in selected institutions and explores factors that influence on trust. The study adopted mixed method approach to explore the problem phenomenon. The study finds that ethnic majority has more trust in public institutions than that of minority, and identity, language of administration and lack of equal representation in bureaucracy are also considerably determine level of trust citizens have in public institutions. Further, political patronage in service delivery has subverted quality of public institutions and trust, interestingly, citizens those who support and being affiliated with ruling party tend to have more trust in government. Police and village-level officers are least trusted owing to endemic corruption.

AB How bureaucracies respond publicly to policy inputs received in the context of stakeholder participation in policymaking provides important insights into their reputation-building strategies. We examine the European Commission's public engagement with stakeholders' inputs. We argue this is driven by its attempts to simultaneously consolidate its core, well-established reputation as a responsible policymaker, and cultivate a newer reputation as a responsive to public demands institution. This helps navigating the challenges of having to find new sources of authority and legitimacy (embedded in participatory policymaking) while also maintaining its more established ones (embedded in evidence-based policymaking). We analyse a new dataset recording stakeholders' inputs received as part of the EC's legislative simplification programme. We find the Commission prioritised strengthening its core reputation over cultivating its emergent one. Evidence-based inputs were significantly more likely to receive an EC public response and inform its legislative simplification programme relative to opinion-based ones. Citizens' inputs were significantly less likely to receive a response and inform the programme. Our findings diverge from research indicating bureaucracies prioritise defending their emerging reputations, highlight the Commission's commitment to maintain its reputational and institutional uniqueness in the EU regulatory state, and reveal a reputation-building approach akin to that of EU agencies.

AB The concept of "policy advisory systems" was introduced by Halligan in 1995 as a way to characterize and analyze the multiple sources of policy advice utilized by governments in policy-making processes. The concept has proved useful and has influenced thinking about both the nature of policy work in different advisory venues as well as how these systems change over time. However, to date this work has examined mainly cases of developed countries and its application to developing and transitional countries is less certain. This paper sets out existing models of policy advisory systems based on Halligan's original thinking on the subject and assesses the findings of many existing studies into OECD countries that advisory systems have been changing as a result of the dual effects of increased use of external consultants and others sources of advice - "externalization" - and the increased use of partisan advice inside government itself - "politicization". Determining whether or not such changes have also characterized the situations found in developing and transitional countries and at the international-domestic and state-sub-state levels is the subject of the papers in this Special Issue.

Risk politicization means that issue expansion and attention cycles are likely to be related to the social construction of policy images. An interesting case in point concerns the risk perception about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) among four groups of people in South Korea: bureaucrats, citizens, scientists, and interest groups. We develop expectations about how the four groups will frame the political issues based on their roles and concerns in the policy process. Downs' (Downs, Anthony. 1972. Up and down with ecology: The issueattention cycle. Public Interest 28: 3850) work on the issueattention cycle suggests how issues rise and fall on the public agenda, and our work also directly tests his theses. This study uses semantic network analysis based on content analysis of key words in 6 400 articles published in 2008 to construct semantic networks for the four stakeholder groups over four stages in the policy process. Through this unique data analysis, we can see the major issue concerns and intensity of each of the four groups in the four policy stages by assessing the key words each group uses in the media articles and the visualizations of their semantic associations. We do find distinct differences in what issues each of the four groups focus on and how the focus of substance changes in each of the four policy stages that clarify how these groups framed the BSE policy issues. Our results both confirm and raise doubts about some predictions from the issueattention cycle. Citizens' attention follows closely to Downs' predictions, whereas the other stakeholders' issueattention cycles do not follow Downs' predictions as well. Finally, our study explains and demonstrates the value of semantic network analysis as a powerful method for understanding issue framing in the policy process.

AB The strategic nature of presidential appointments and politicization of federal prosecution have flourished as separate strains of research. This article opens a dialogue between them by theoretically developing expectations for the three distinct origins of interim U.S. Attorneys. The expectations are tested using an original, continuous data set of all 93 U.S. Attorney positions for 1987 to 2016, which, unlike any other study, includes details of appointment and service for Senate-confirmed and interim appointees. We find that the opportunity to realize his agenda and divergence from his predecessors motivates the president's revealed preference for interim United States Attorneys of his own choosing.

AB Parallel streams of literature in economics and management suggest that a centralized power structure tends to produce a top-heavy personnel structure in government bureaucracies. Supportive evidence is derived from a hand-collected dataset of ministry organization charts from 22 European countries. The structure of the bureaucratic pyramid is more top heavy in Eastern Europe than it is in Western Europe. Within Eastern Europe, countries that have preserved Soviet-style bureaucratic power structures have the most top-heavy ministries, whereas others that have reduced power centralization by separating political and administrative power have less top-heavy ministry pyramids that are more like those found in Western Europe.

AB This paper identifies the intersecting technical and social factors that have fueled a history of conflict between artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) and large-scale mining, and more recently, their potential coexistence, in Marmato, Colombia. At Marmato, a vertically zoned ore body and corresponding vertically stacked land claims have in part fueled tensions between ASM and large-scale mining. These same characteristics have also given rise to a scenario which could facilitate the coexistence of both parties. The case of Marmato has implications for policy and decision-making around relations between ASM and large-scale mining elsewhere, notably: 1) how a politicization of natural hazards can exacerbate existing asymmetries in power, wealth, and risk; 2) some deposit types such as epithermal veins may be particularly suited to coexistence, but site-specific characteristics determine whether the technically feasible mining methods could facilitate or preclude coexistence; 3) how equity is central to successful coexistence; and 4) how approaches such as contract mining will need to integrate social and technical considerations.

AB Trust is the "glue" connecting state and society and particularly relevant to how front-line workers, who are the face of public administration vis-a-vis citizens, implement policy. Therefore, it is important to examine how front-line workers' absence of trust in regulators influences the ways they cope with their clients. Our study investigates this question empirically through interviews and focus groups with 80 Israeli social service providers. Our results show that front-line workers' distrust in regulators is a product of four factors: perceived lack of protection, clash of values, politicization in implementation processes, and regulators' "disconnection" from the field. It leads them to adopt two coping strategies: acts of self-protection and deviation from formal policy. A further derivative is their turnover intention.

TI Citizen forces The politics of community policing in Turkey
SO AMERICAN ETHNOLOGIST
LA English
DT Article
AB In the last 15 years the Turkish National Police have invested heavily in "community policing," espousing the belief that a strong police-public relationship will curtail authoritarian policing and police violence. Yet this reform has intensified popular desires for more policing and fostered a new type of citizen-police subject, what I call citizen forces. The purportedly liberal tool of community policing turned the previously despised figure of the police informer into a respected practitioner of engaged, responsible, and vigilant citizenship. When functioning as ancillary police forces, citizen forces can help consolidate state power and aggravate state repression, especially against suspect Others. Emerging mostly at the neighborhood level, such forms of policing and politicization demonstrate the increasing complicity and mutual constitution of police and citizens, as well as the formation of state-sponsored vigilantism.

AB Recent research on political advisers is characterized by an expansion beyond Westminster and clearer connections with proximate literatures. This article speaks to the second of these features by applying the Public Service Bargain (PSB) lens to minister/political adviser relationships in new ways. Extant PSB analyses either position political advisers as an independent variable influencing the core bargain between ministers and senior officials, or face difficulties when viewing advisers through existing perspectives developed to explain deals between politicians and public servants. Consequently, the nature of 'the bargain applying to political advisers' (Hood and Lodge 2006, p. 128) remains unclear. This article addresses that lacuna by deploying the reward, competence and loyalty dimensions of PSBs to specify the broad terms of the political adviser bargain, and considers the theoretical and empirical implications of such compacts.

AB This article explores how political principals weigh loyalty and competence in public personnel decisions. Exploiting the abrupt shift in political leadership following the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye of Korea, the authors examine how the newly elected president made the decision to retain or dismiss 118 agency heads appointed by the previous administration. The evidence shows the importance of loyalty in managerial survival: those who had a political patronage relationship with the ousted president were less likely to survive in the new administration. However, the authors also demonstrate the relevance of competence, as measured by the outcomes of agency performance evaluation. Further, the article shows the existence of negativity bias: the punishment for low performance is greater than the reward for high performance. Finally, the authors provide support for the idea that political principals reward loyalists, but only if they show acceptable levels of competence.

ID CIVIL-SERVICE; STATE; BUREAUCRACY; POLITICIZATION; MODERNIZATION
AB This article examines the status of historical legacies in debates on the reform of public administration in East Central Europe. It identifies limitations of existing accounts and derives three dimensions for the further development of legacy explanations of administrative reform in East Central Europe. First, legacy arguments tend to zoom in on the negative effects of the communist past. Yet there is not one but many legacies that matter for post-communist reforms and these many legacies have to be carefully distinguished and conceptualized. Second, legacy explanations tend to search for broad similarities between the administrative past and the present set-up of East Central European administrations in order to demonstrate the importance of the legacy. The identification of similarities is, however, not sufficient for the identification of legacy effects. Instead, the article argues in favour of the identification of causal mechanisms of legacification to explain recent administrative developments in East Central Europe. Finally, the article draws attention to the interaction of legacy effects with other determinants of administrative reform such as European integration and political parties.
   Points for practitioners
   This article addresses primarily policy-makers who deal with the reform of public administration in Central and Eastern Europe. It addresses the issue of how administrative traditions and, generally, historical legacies affect the design of administrative reforms and the successful implementation of reforms. Conventional wisdom concentrates on the negative effects of the communist-type administration on contemporary reform in Central and Eastern Europe. This article advances a more differentiated perspective on the impact of historical legacies. It argues that communist administrations evolved over time and differed considerably across countries. The administrative experience of other historical periods further interacts with the communist legacy of the past. The article also identifies various mechanisms that help to 'transport' the legacy of the past into the contemporary administrative reform context. For administrative policy-makers this approach implies that they cannot take for granted that the effect of the communist legacy is identical across countries and they cannot even assume that the communist administration will be long-lasting after transition. Instead, it is recommended that the specifics of local administrative traditions and the kind of mechanisms that produce legacy effects in the context of contemporary reform efforts be examined more closely.

AB Focusing on ambassador appointments, the aim of this pioneering article is to address some fundamental questions about where men and women are positioned in diplomacy. Most of the gender-related diplomacy studies are limited to individual Ministry of Foreign Affairs and say little about diplomacy as an aggregate set of practices. We draw on theories of gender and positional status to ask whether there are gender patterns in ambassador appointments-with men occupying positions of higher military and economic status than women-much like the ones found in other institutions. Our analyses are based on a unique data set containing almost 7,000 ambassador appointments, made by the fifty highest ranked countries in terms of GDP in 2014. The results show that female ambassadors are less likely to occupy high-status ambassadorships than men. In short, gender patterns, linked to power and status, are present also in ambassador appointments. Diplomacy studies need to do much more to address the presence and impact of gender in international affairs.

AB Job rotation is an important tool in public administration that is used to enhance learning and diversify experience among employees, while reducing opportunities for rent-seeking behaviour. The benefits of job rotation, however, may be reduced if carried out too frequently or for narrow partisan reasons. Frequent transfers and postings in a civil service characterized by life-long contracts negatively impact on-the-job learning, accountability for results, and incentives to acquire skills. This study examines the political and internal civil service determinants of frequent transfers in the civil service of Punjab, Pakistan. We employ Poisson panel estimations for 338 job positions for elite management cadres in Pakistan over a five-year period from 2006 to 2010. The analysis shows that a change in elected government and desirability of a position increase the frequency of transfers.

AB Principal-agent models of corruption control that emphasize rules, incentives, and sanctions as prime antecedents of corruption often stop short when evaluating how these general principles translate into concrete Human Resource Management (HRM) policies. Following a call to develop research about how day-to-day public management operations change incentives to be corrupt, we use data of 5.22 million USD audited to 545 local Mexican governments over 3 years to test the correlation between the misappropriation of public funds and specific HRM functions. Our results suggest that HRM is a critical, underseen factor in understanding the risk of corruption. In line with previous findings, we show that having merit-based recruitment can prevent corruption. However, we also find that having performance and departmental evaluations and a less unequal structure of remunerations may also help local governments effectively avoid the misappropriation of public money.

AB Although international organizations (IOs) and their secretariats play important roles in international politics, we know surprisingly little about their staffing composition and the factors that shape it. What accounts for the national composition of the secretariats of IOs? We theorize that the national composition of international secretariats is shaped by three factors: the desire by powerful states for institutional control, a commonly shared interest in a secretariat's functional effectiveness, and, increasingly, a need for secretariats to be seen as legitimate by being representative of the global population. Building on recent constructivist literature, we argue that IOs face increasing normative pressure to be representative in their staffing patterns. Using panel regression, we assess our argument with a new dataset covering states' representation in the secretariats of thirty-five United Nations system bodies from 1997 to 2015. The results indicate that while functional effectiveness plays a significant and stable role, international secretariats have become increasingly representative of the global population. Moreover, this has come primarily at the expense of the over-representation of powerful states. This shift from power to representation is particularly strong in large IOs with high political and societal visibility. When it comes to IO secretariats, representativeness (increasingly) matters.

AB Archaeological fieldwork is no longer what it used to be. Over the last decades, archaeologists have begun to "study up". Approaching regional, national, and international heritage regimes, they have empirically scrutinized how institutions and people in positions of influence shape what will count as "our common past" tomorrow. This has paved the way for a deeper and more nuanced understanding of contemporary heritage governance. It has also meant stepping onto a minefield of ethical and methodological challenges that archaeologists are often unprepared for. In this article, we address some of the points and pitfalls of investigating international heritage regimes, starting from our own experiences studying UNESCO and the EU and putting them in conversation with the experiences of other scholars studying up. By reflecting on the reasons for studying up, and discussing the hands-on challenges of access, anonymity, and research reception, we aim to promote a stronger and more transparent tradition of studying up in archaeology.
