Repository with data on the political connections of bureaucrats (Political Science/Public Administration).

The research project sought to map the literature on the political connections of bureaucrats focusing on their relationship with interest groups. I used Scopus and Web of Science to find publications on this topic from 2000 to 2022. This repository contains the main collections (more details in the Appendix).
