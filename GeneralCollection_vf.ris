N2  - In Soviet times, water management was presented generally as a technical issue to be taken care of by the state water bureaucracy. Due to structural changes in agriculture in the two decades post-independence, irrigation water management has become an explicitly political and social issue in Central Asia. With the state still heavily present in the regulation of agricultural production, the situation in Uzbekistan differs from other postcommunist states. Water management strategies are still strongly 'Soviet' in approach, regarded by state actors as purely 'technical', because other dimensions - economic, social and political - are 'fixed' through strong state regulation. However, new mechanisms are appearing in this authoritarian and technocratic framework. The application of a framework for socio-technical analysis in some selected Water Users' Associations (WUAs) in northwest Uzbekistan's Khorezm region shows that the WUAs are becoming arenas of interaction for different interest groups involved in water management. The socio-technical analysis of Khorezm's water management highlights growing social differences at grass root level in the study of WUAs. The process of social differentiation is in its early phases, but is still able to express itself fully due to the strict state control of agriculture and social life in general.

N2  - We develop a theory that considers important differences in competition in the political arena based on whether firms are attempting to maintain or alter the status quo. Particularly, we argue that although investing resources and time to build relationships with politicians and government officials fosters trust, solidarity, and reciprocity, likely producing desired outcomes for both firms attempting to maintain the status quo and those trying to alter it, such relationships are more strongly positive for firms maintaining the status quo. As the effectiveness of relational strategies may differ based on firms' political strategies and firm characteristics, we then theorize that the effects of a more relational approach on ``winning{''} these desired outcomes for firms seeking to maintain or alter the status quo will bemoderated by (1) prior targeting in the political arena where the competition unfolds and (2) a firm's social reputation. Specifically, we argue that knowledge and relationships from prior targeting in a political domain where competition unfolds, and a firm's better social reputation will strengthen the effect of a more relational approach on securing desired outcomes for both firms seeking to maintain and alter the status quo. We expect the moderating effect for a firm's targeting and social reputation will be stronger for firms seeking to maintain the status quo compared with firms seeking to alter the status quo. Our study contributes to corporate political activity literature and notably to the research on political markets by advancing a more nuanced but realistic understanding of interfirm rivalry for governmental outcomes.

N2  - Despite many studies investigating how lobbying expenditures enhance performance outcomes, limited attention has been given to understanding the underlying mechanisms driving firm lobbying behaviors—and, particularly, where firms target their lobbying expenditures. We argue lobbying breadth serves as a risk management strategy to both hedge against possible government intrusion and minimize disapproval of firm actions from government officials. As such, we posit firms’ strategic risk will positively relate to breadth of lobbying firms’ target. Further, if lobbying breadth serves as risk management strategy, then other aspects that affect decisions about the amount of risk protection a firm may need should also affect this relationship. We argue that CEOs’ ownership and firms’ political uncertainty may exacerbate exposure from firm risk taking to government actions, thus strengthening the insurance relationship. Similarly, we argue available slack, as a form of internal insurance against government actions, will weaken the relationship between strategic risk taking and lobbying breadth. We find support for most of our arguments in a sample of U. S. manufacturing firms. This research extends understanding of lobbying beyond the predominant focus on expenditures and securing beneficial outcomes. Exploring how lobbying breadth serves an important risk management role also offers insights into firm nonmarket strategy. © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - This article examines changes in the background characteristics, attitudes, and behavior patterns of high-level U.S. federal executives. It also considers the impact of the New Public Management (NPM) movement. The data indicate that despite intense struggles about the role of the public sector, top civil servants remain a well-educated, experienced, and highly motivated group, the members of which compare favorably to top executives in the private sector. The data also suggest that the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978 has been effective in producing a more politically responsive corps of career civil servants, and that administrators (both career and noncareer) are increasingly attuned to the more technical and legal aspects of their roles and less oriented to protecting particular interests or clientele groups. NPM-style changes are still in progress and remain controversial, but it appears that political leaders continue to have an excellent (and increasingly diverse) group of career people to work with and a system that-at least in part due to the CSRA reforms-is more responsive to them than before. The top part of the U.S. bureaucracy may have been bent and reshaped in many ways over the last thirty years, but, despite widely publicized fears, it has not broken.

N2  - This study explores the evolution of the Green Grants program, run by Brazil's Ministry of Environment, as a means for developing the concept of bureaucratic activism. When the Workers' Party first took office in 2003, many social movement actors joined the government, especially in that agency. After 2007, however, most of these activists left the government. At the same time, the ministry substituted thousands of temporary employees for permanent civil servants. Surprisingly, this study finds that these public employees carried forward the environmentalist cause, even when this required contesting the priorities of superiors. Examining their attitudes and practices leads to a definition of activism as the proactive pursuit of opportunities to defend contentious causes. The case study helps to develop this concept and to demonstrate that workers inside bureaucracies can engage in activist behavior. It also explores the effects of bureaucratic activism on environmental policymaking in Brazil. © 2019 University of Miami.

N2  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between sales networks and effectiveness in overseas government markets with a focus on overseas home-country officials, and local key government officials. Design/methodology/approach – A random sample of American firms and their affiliates that have engaged or are engaged in project contracting with African governments was surveyed to collect data for the study using a mail survey. Findings – Connectedness to home-country overseas actors is positively associated with network connections involving key government officials. This local network connection, in turn, has a positive effect on sales effectiveness. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited to bidding on projects and selling to government agencies in the African context. More research focusing on different industries and markets are needed to increase knowledge regarding the effect of network connections on international sales effectiveness. Practical implications – The practical implications of this study include the need for international sales managers to engage in networking involving their home-country official overseas as well as local government officials. Therefore, exporting advocacy is important. Also, the education and training of international sales people should emphasize the concept of sales network. Originality/value – The study extends understanding regarding the network approach to international sales in government markets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

N2  - Criminal statistics for the last few years indicates a certain drop in the number of registered corruption crimes in Russia. A decrease in the number of grave corruption crimes serves as a backdrop for the considerable increase in the number of crimes of small and medium gravity, which is certainly a cause for concern. There is a number of legislative prohibitions aimed at counteracting corruption among civil servants, which can be broken into five groups. The first group of prohibitions was introduced to prevent illegal enrichment of civil servants through the abuse of authority. The second group includes prohibitions aimed at ensuring the constitutional principle of the separation of powers as well as the independence of local authority bodies and trade unions. The third group prohibits public servants from using their official position to serve the interests of other countries, international and foreign organizations, foreign citizens if it contradicts the interests of the Russian state. The fourth group prohibits public servants from using their official position to serve the interests of political parties, other public or religious organizations if it contradicts the interests of their public office. The fifth group encompasses prohibitions aimed at ensuring that public servants observe the rules of public behavior and dissemination of classified information. Thus there is a rather wide circle of legislative limitations for public servants. At the same time, the efficiency of their implementation is so low that the law enforcement issues cannot be overlooked. The declared principle of unavoidability of liability for public servants committing corruption crimes remains but a declaration in a number of cases. The fuzziness of procedural norms and the absence of effective organizational mechanisms for punishing offenders sometimes prevent the enforcement this principle, which practically nullifies the benefit of including in the law a vast number of prohibitions aimed at counteracting corruption. All this certainly reduces the effectiveness of counteracting corruption among public servants and shows that there is an urgent necessity for a further improvement of anti-corruption legislation and the practice of its enforcement.

N2  - The Mexican Association for the Right to Information (AMEDI to use its Spanish acronym), the most prominent media reform group in the country, has for the last decade conducted a permanent campaign for the democratization of media in Mexico. During this time AMEDI has developed a number of effective strategies, which include: constant advocacy, by organizing conferences and symposiums, providing relevant information through their website and public communiques and cementing an eclectic but unified front against media power; permanent monitoring, by identifying in National Congress all MPs with close personal or professional connections to big media and evaluating the performance of media regulators and key civil servants; strategic litigation, by fighting in court commercial transactions carried out by media corporations which could further entrench media concentration and contesting in the Supreme Court of Justice the constitutionality of particular pieces of legislation; and research and policy- making exercises, by publishing academic books and drafting media law to be submitted for legislative consideration. Alongside an advantageous political environment and the pressure asserted by a dynamic student movement, these strategies have been responsible for the 2013 telecommunications reform and the transformation of the legal framework regulating media in Mexico. © 2016 Fordham University Press.

N2  - In January 2016, academics in Turkey distributed a peace petition calling for an end to hostilities and to restart negotiations with the Kurdish movement. The Turkish government responded by opening legal cases, jailing academics, and dismissing them from universities. In the state of emergency following the July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, the government's extended powers allowed them to fire thousands of civil servants from every branch of government, including thousands of academics. This increased the number of academics who organized to form and teach in academic collectives. The current study evaluates how politicization occurs in scholars removed from the university environment. Traditional approaches to collective action and politicization suggest that empowerment is an important catalyst in politicization and continuation of collective political engagement. With the social and political restrictions that decree law dismissals place on scholars, what is it that motivates them to politicize? The current study was conducted through semistructured interviews with nine academics who work in these collectives. Participants described their politicization in terms of previous practice, reaction to injustice, and ideals of academia and academic freedom. They further evaluated current and prospective functions and possible barriers to academic collectives. Finally, although somewhat ambivalent, participants discussed feelings of efficacy, psychosocial support, and senses of solidarity and liberation in terms of being empowered. Their perspectives provide an opportunity to understand how and where academics engage in scholar activism for an independent and free academia in the context of consolidated political oppression.

N2  - If representative democracy is not about elected officials responding directly to voters' preferences, and if the voters do a poor job of voting their interests in referendums, then what is democracy about? In our view, a satisfactory theory of democracy would focus normatively on the social identities and political interests of citizens rather than on their expressed policy preferences, and empirically on the ability of organized or attentive groups to get those identities and interests effectively recognized and acted on in the governmental process. A group-theoretic version of democratic theory along these lines would dispense with the most important illusions of the conventional folk theory of democracy. However, much hard work remains to clarify how actual democracies make policy and to construct a wise normative standardinspirational but not innocentagainst which they can be judged.

N2  - An emerging pattern of governance in contemporary liberal democratic
welfare states is a move away from interest group representation and a
public sphere organized around demands for extensions of rights to
something much more constrained. This article asks how such a profound
shift in representation has occurred through governance spaces that are
co-constructed by community organizations. It examines the case of
Canadian immigrant settlement where beliefs about citizen
representation, the role of the state and the nature of the public
sphere have undergone profound change, leaving immigrant organizations
as either marginal players or fully incorporated in state sanctioned
immigrant service provision. Drawing on documentary evidence and
interviews with immigrant organizations and public officials in Ottawa,
it shows how immigrant organizations have actively interpreted their
interests in the light of this changing web of beliefs to co-construct a
new policy regime that favours organizational interests over citizen
participation.

N2  - A dominant current of thought with regard to administrative reform in Mexico and Latin America recommends the de-politicization of bureaucracy, the reduction of inter-institutional conflict and the isolation of administration from society. Nevertheless, the historical experience of the development of the administrative state in the United States holds very different lessons. The U.S. case reveals that the construction of a strong administrative apparatus is an essentially political endeavour that arises out of inter-institutional conflict and an intense engagement between state and society. Mexico and Latin America would be well advised to pay more attention to the real historical experience of the U.S. and less to development professionals who offer quick solutions and facile recipes based in an idealized representation of the U.S. case.

N2  - Politicians react to administrative policy making by developing systems of oversight. Existing studies largely emphasize the advantages of reactive oversight, where politicians wait for interest groups to pull a fire alarm on noncompliant activity. Less attention has been paid to proactive oversight, where politicians police administrators directly. To evaluate the effectiveness of police patrol oversight, I look to the White House, which has been policing regulatory proposals since the Nixon administration. I show how policing, or regulatory review, has made agencies more responsive to the president, both by singling out noncompliant proposals and, critically, by shaping agency behavior in anticipation of review. My findings suggest that police patrol oversight is more efficient than previously acknowledged, notably because the associated deterrence effects yield low-cost compliance. I conclude with a discussion of why Congress, despite having similar incentives to control administrators, has not adopted a parallel system of policing.

N2  - This article focuses on current state of career and language training of officers of the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic sector (hereinafter MoD CR) and their possibilities of the training to achieve required state from the economic effectiveness point of view. Both career and language requirements create qualification requirements which are one of the attributes of any systemized place in the organizational units' structure of the MoD CR sector. Considering the sector conditions, their fulfillment is necessary for succession planning which is closely connected to the setting of professional soldiers' rankings in the career management system to systemized places, appointment to higher ranks and employment extension. By the amendment of the Act No. 221/1999 Coll. On Professional Soldiers from 2015 and by other relating sector documents was set that the career management guarantees to appoint already trained soldiers. To those, who do not fulfill qualification requirements, not even in current service placement, will be given a period of time to fulfill the requirements up to 2019. In 2019, the state of career and language training would correspond to the requirements which are set for systemized places in the organizational units' structure of the MoD CR sector. Considering that up to now more than one half of professional soldiers do not fulfill the qualification requirement level set for systemized places and the capacities of structural education facilities are limited, the defence sector faces a difficult task. There is a possibility to choose between full-time and combined career and language courses and considering the language training there is also the possibility of language training within the army units or motivation to self-study. The defence sector will have to deal with short-term increase of personnel to cover the needs or to use external providers to cover required services. The matter of economic effectiveness is crucial when managing the properties and means of the state. Considering the economic effectiveness and rationality from the economy theory point of view is crucial to decision making about the optimal use of sources. Thus the following article introduces a model created with the aid of the analysis Activity Based Costing. This model will help us to uncover the expensiveness of particular options of the career and language training ensuring, to consider the options of required qualification of the MoD CR sector officers ensuring and subsequently it will be possible to effectively decide about their ensuring.

N2  - Why do authoritarian states adopt 'state feminist' policies, and what are the effects of these initiatives? This article expands our understanding of state feminist institutions in non-democracies by examining the development of a women's national machinery in Cameroon. It argues that the Cameroonian state has adopted a national machinery because: (1) it provides low-cost international legitimacy; (2) it attracts international assistance; (3) this assistance fuels domestic patronage networks; and (4) the national machinery channels women's activism toward state-delineated projects and goals. These motives undercut its ability to promote women's advancement. National machineries in authoritarian contexts are not just plagued by technical problems and funding shortages but also by competing agendas within the state apparatus and a lack of a commitment by high-level government officials to improving women's status in society. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - While there has been a significant amount of research on transnational feminist activism at the global level, many feminist transnational advocacy networks are mobilizing within world regions. The lack of attention to the regional level has created a considerable imbalance in research on transnational activism. This article's first objective is to define regional advocacy networks (RANs) as a collection of individuals and organizations from the same world region working together toward a common goal. The article's second objective is to explore the conditions under which RANs are influential. We investigate conditions for RAN success through a case study of an African network that helped create one of the world's most progressive treaties on women's rights, the African Union Protocol to the Charter on Human and People's Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. From an analysis of primary sources and interviews with key participants, we suggest that three factors are crucial for network success: whether a RAN builds alliances with key politicians and civil servants, whether a RAN is able to participate in the decision-making process, and whether a RAN's goals overlap with the target institution's priorities. The broader implication of our study is that scholars seeking to understand the creation of women's rights commitments, the diffusion of women's rights norms, and compliance with women's rights treaties need to look beyond the international and domestic levels of action to include the regional level in their analyses.

N1  - From Duplicate 1 (Information technology and government corruption in developing countries: evidence from Ghana customs - Addo, Atta; Avgerou, Chrisanthi)

Exclusion criteria: street-level bureaucrats
N2  - The literature on information technology (IT) and government corruption in developing countries indicates contradictory evidence about the realization of anti-corruption effects. So far, there is no theoretical explanation of why the anti-corruption potential of IT demonstrated in some countries is not realized in many other countries. Drawing evidence from a case study of information systems interventions at Ghana customs over 35 years, we investigate how and why IT's anti-corruption potential may be curtailed in the context of developing countries' governments and societies. We focus on IT mediated petty corruption practices of street-level officers, which we consider to be socially embedded and institutionally conditioned phenomena. We find that conditions of possibility for the IT-mediated petty corruption practices are created during the implementation of information systems. The configuration of IT and organizational processes of a government agency are constrained by the broader government administration system and influenced by the vested interests of government officers, politicians, and businesses. Subsequently, the co-optation of IT for petty corruption practices is enabled by networks of relationships and institutions of patronage that extend across government, business, and society. We thus explain the often limited effects of IT on petty corruption as the inability of localized information systems implementations to change modes of government administration that are embedded in the enduring neopatrimonial institutions and politics of many developing countries.

N2  - The study investigated the roles of bureaucracy in Nigeria and its inadequacies in adhering to the Weberian model of policy implementation in the Nigeria democratic governance. The study adopted a survey research design and utilized primary data obtained through the administration of questionnaires to a purposively selected 220 respondents comprising senior bureaucrats and CSOs, and conduct of the in-depth interview. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis with the aid of SPSS. The study revealed that even though, bureaucrats are not necessarily the primary makers of the policy. They play an active role in policy implementation in Nigeria. However, factors such as political pressure, inadequate budgetary allocation, over politicization of the appointment into governmental offices leading to inadequate professionalism, and environmental variables hinder the effective implementation of policy in Nigeria. It was equally established that as ideal as the Weberian model of bureaucracy is, there are inevitable lacuna and inadequacies in its application to Nigeria, due to factors such as socio-cultural forces, collectivism as against individualism, and absolute formalism. The study concluded that, although Weberian bureaucracy could be ideal and applicable to large-scale economy, its model is inadequate in addressing all the needs and circumstances of Nigeria. Hence, the need to restructure or readjust the bureaucracy to adapt to new and complex problems becomes apparent. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Most states lack the ability to maintain a uniform presence at the local level. While in some places, cit-izens experience an attentive and present state that is quick to address their demands, in other parts, the same state can be unresponsive and absent. The unevenness in state presence shapes its capacity to deliv-ery services and its legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens. What explains the spatial unevenness in local state presence? This paper argues that the transfer preferences of mid-level bureaucrats are an important determinant of local state presence. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines insights from qual-itative fieldwork and a unique dataset on the transfers history of mid-level bureaucrats in Indian land bureaucracy, I show that bureaucrats have strong transfer preferences and regularly lobby to avoid being placed in jurisdictions further away from their homes or being relocated over long distances. Jurisdictions less preferred by bureaucrats are more likely to experience state absence at the local level. Further, spatial disparities in local state absence are concentrated according to historical patterns of development across different regions of the state; historically less developed regions with lower bureaucratic representation within the state and experience a more prolonged duration of bureaucratic absence on account of bureau-cratic lobbying against transfer directives. This paper highlights the importance of transfer preferences of individual bureaucrats and their collective representation in shaping the quality of local governance.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Context Despite being a nuclear power, Pakistan does not have satisfactory human development indicators. The 2018 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI) ranking places it at 150 out of 189 countries, the lowest in the region after Afghanistan. Purpose This article examines advocacy journalism coverage of human development issues versus other issues in the contents of mainstream Pakistani newspapers and investigates the factors behind the inadequate space give n to them. The study further explores the association between editorial and readers' priorities. Methods The quantitative content analysis method is used to measure and compare the frequency of sample content in five categories coupled with qualitative in-depth interviews with veteran journalists/academics to explain the factors that influence the editorial content. Findings Rather than use precious space to comment on social hardship and ultimately improve the country's HDI value, editorial content is dominated by the discourse produced by the communication bureaucracies of powerful national and international establishments. Issues-based policies of the state and political actors that do not concern human development, and warmongering and actual conflicts with India and Afghanistan, are given considerably greater coverage. Moreover, readers' reactions to editorial content through Facebook Likes indicate a clear difference between editorial and readers' priorities. Policy Implications The communication aspects of development programmes should actively feed editorial boards regarding current global development agendas to ensure sufficient coverage of their advocacy. It is imperative to make the UNESCO-led syllabus Teaching Journalism for Sustainable Development an integral part of the country's journalism curriculum. Relevant bodies should organize professional editorial training to raise awareness of how to use precious space wisely for the advocacy of development issues and how to be alert to the readers' priority issues.

N2  - The central focus of this article is applied and manipulate the features of the Rasch Wright Map to evaluate and determine the level of competency of potential public servant for the consideration of the appointment as ICT procurement officer (PO), specifically those who deal with vendor proposal evaluation. A set of questionnaires was formed for this purpose based on finding from Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The questionnaire consists of 55 items divided into four (4) clusters, i. Strategic, ii. Knowledge, iii. Skills and iv. Personal Traits. The item reliability at +0.94 considered as very good level. The research has discovered that most of the respondents were possessed and endorsed sufficient items to consider them as a capable and an eligible officer for the task of PO. Nevertheless, the finding also uncovered that the respondent may experience some problems in sustaining their perseverance to accomplish their tasks and maintain their confidence level in making the vital decision. There were also issues on the relationship between stakeholders and officers, and the paucity of PO involvement in the development of the organisation ICT master plan. Therefore, it can be deduced that the features offered by the Rasch Wright map were very helpful in determining the level of public servant competency for the appointment of PO in the public sector to enhance the ICT procurement procedure.

N2  - The aim of the literature on the political economy of instrument choice is to provide insights into real-world instrument choices and to explain when and why particular types of instruments, such as quotas, standards, rules, pollution taxes, tradable permits, etc., are adopted to control environmental pollution and other externalities. The instrument choice is viewed as the outcome of a rational political decision-making process where the interests of voters, politicians, special-interest groups, and bureaucrats are traded off and mitigated. Much of the literature emphasizes that well-organized polluter special-interest groups play a dominating role. This is suggestive of a strong political bias against pollution taxes, tradable permits, and other incentive-orientated instruments but the suggestion is challenged by the increasing popularity of these instruments observed in recent decades in Europe (e.g., green-tax reforms in many countries and the European Union's market for greenhouse gas emission permits), in the United States (e.g., the Acid Rain Program) and elsewhere (e.g., the congestion-charging scheme in Singapore). More ambitious environmental goals, increasing marginal cost of public funds, and a greater emphasis on buying political acceptability through revenue recycling and free allocation of tradable permits provide some tentative answers to this challenge.

N2  - In the last 15 years the Turkish National Police have invested heavily
in ``community policing,{''} espousing the belief that a strong
police-public relationship will curtail authoritarian policing and
police violence. Yet this reform has intensified popular desires for
more policing and fostered a new type of citizen-police subject, what I
call citizen forces. The purportedly liberal tool of community policing
turned the previously despised figure of the police informer into a
respected practitioner of engaged, responsible, and vigilant
citizenship. When functioning as ancillary police forces, citizen forces
can help consolidate state power and aggravate state repression,
especially against suspect Others. Emerging mostly at the neighborhood
level, such forms of policing and politicization demonstrate the
increasing complicity and mutual constitution of police and citizens, as
well as the formation of state-sponsored vigilantism. {[}police,

N2  - This study aims to fill this gap and provide an overview of both the legal reform processes occurring in the field of public service and of recent developments and challenges related to the process of reforms that have occurred during the 1991-2011 period in Kazakhstan. The key goal of the investigation is to study and suggest the approaches to reforming the Kazakhstan's system of government to enhance its transparency and establish civil service in decision-making process. This paper first outlines the discourse on the reform of public service among scholars and public officials in Kazakhstan. Then, it elaborates on the laws and institutional measures that have provided for the establishment of a public service system Kazakhstan. Finally, this paper outlines the challenges faced by the government and public service institutions on the way to increasing the efficiency of public services in Kazakhstan. Authors focused their attention on those issues related to the problems with personnel policy, corruption, lack of transparency and merit-based appointments in the civil service of Kazakhstan. To identify the challenges faced by the government and public service institutions on the way to increasing the efficiency of public services in Kazakhstan authors have analysed national laws and outlined the institutional measures that provide the establishment of a public service system in Kazakhstan.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the perceptions of auditor independence between auditors, bank-loan officers, and financial analysts in Bahrain. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the effect of 41 independence-enhancing and - threatening Factors on the perceptions of auditor, bank-loan officers, and financial analysts regarding auditor independence in Bahrain. Out of 450 questionnaires distributed, 281 usable responses were received, representing a response rate of 62.4 percent. Findings: Overall, the three groups agree on the classification of the 41 factors into two groups; however, they do not agree on the relative importance of those factors on their perception of auditor independence. Economic reliance of auditors on their clients and the provisions of non-audit service, competition, and long tenure of audit services are considered the most important independence-threatening factors. The risks posed to auditors in fulfilling their audit engagement, regulatory rights and requirements surrounding auditor change, regulation concerning the appointment/remuneration of auditors, and the disclosure of financial and nonfinancial relationships are among the most important factors that are perceived by the three groups to enhance auditor independence. Research limitations/implications: The samples did not include all users of financial statements; the samples were drawn only from institutions that were willing to take part, and consequently the results might not be applicable to those that did not take part in the study; and data were collected using a survey questionnaire and this approach is subject to certain types of bias such as response bias, which may affect the reliability of the respondents' answers. Practical implications: The paper can inform policy makers, governments, and professional accounting bodies in emerging markets in countries that share similar economic, political, and cultural environment on how policies and frameworks related to auditor independence can be structured to ensure adequate regulation of the capital market, and enhance the awareness of users and auditors about the contextual factors surrounding the role of an auditor, in addition to the possible threats and enhancing factors that affect auditor independence. Originality/value: The paper offers rich data on the perceptions of auditors' independence of auditors and users of financial statements.

N2  - This article critically reviews the role of women's non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Kuwait in supporting human and educational development. The spread of NGO's in any society is an indicator of the involvement of citizens in the events around them, whether in human resource development (HRD) or political advocacy. They act as a check and balance of the government, as they represent the public. This article will outline the historical development of women's NGO's in Kuwait and the challenges they faced in building commitment to gender equality. The discussion illustrates how they have lobbied government and become key stakeholders in national HRD planning. Women's organizations have been in the forefront of social change and equality agendas, garnering public support for civil rights and education provisions. In the absence of a united women's movement in Kuwait, the NGOs are a link for women to access state bureaucracy and make a significant contribution to human development and social change. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - This study aims to elucidate the extent of legal knowledge of those working at ministries of the Civil Service Regulation, and to study the effect of certain variables (Marital status, age group, educational level, specialization, occupational position, years of service, the educational level of the parents and the husband, and the occupation of the father, mother and husband) on her. In order to accomplish the aims of the study a random stratified sample was taken of women who are not a part of the administrative echelons working at Jordanian governmental institutions amounting to (502) employees of a ratio of (35%) of the total number of women employees, taking into account the number of employees in each ministry, the location of their work, out of a total of (76) employees, which is a ratio of (40%) of the employees in an administrative position (section head, director, director general). the most important findings of the study were as follows: Regarding the extent of the legal knowledge of the emplovees at governmental ministries of the rights stipulated in the Civil Service Regulation, this knowledge varies relative to the rights provided for in the Civil Service Regulation according to die varied fields. In fact, the findings of the study indicate that the highest level of the greatest knowledge to the least knowledge was as follows: holidays, followed bv promotion, appointment and allowances, then penalization and termination of service (dismissal), then transport and deputization while the lowest degree of knowledge was in the matters related to missions (scholarships) and courses. The findings also show the effect of certain social, economic and demographic factors on legal knowledge. It was found that the married employees possess greater knowledge in the areas of (holidays, scholarships and courses, termination of Service (dismissal) than divorced employees. It became evident that the knowledge of the workingwomen of die age group (from 35-50 years) in the areas of (holidays, penalization and termination of services, scholarships and courses, transport and deputation) exceeds those whose age is 50 years and above. In respect of the impact of educational level on the degree of knowledge it was evident that there is an exponential relationship between the educational level of the employee and the degree of her legal knowledge in all areas with the exception of die area of penalization and termination of services. Moreover, the academic specialization has an impact on the degree of knowledge. It was found that the employees with humanities specializations in all fields have a higher degree of knowledge of the Civil Service Regulation than those who only have a high school education. This also applies to those who have scientific specializations, for they have greater knowledge in the areas of holidays, promotion, appointments and allowances than those women without a specialization. As regards the effect of the post on knowledge, the findings show that a section head possesses greater knowledge than an employee in all areas with the exception of scholarships and courses, while a director has a higher degree of knowledge than an emplovee in the area of scholarships and courses. The findings show that die number of years of service has an effect in terms of increased legal knowledge. In fact, it became evident that the employee who served from (10-20 years) possesses greater knowledge of the rights stipulated in die Civil Sendee Regulation in all areas, than those who served for (more than 20 years), Furthermore, the findings show that the employees with (10-20 years) of experience are more knowledgeable of the rights provided for in the Civil Service Regulation in all areas with the exception of the areas of promotions, appointments, allowances, scholarships and courses, and transport and deputations, The findings show that the knowledge of the employees with (less than 10 years of experience) is more than those with (10-20) years of service. the researcher made recommendations in which she emphasized the role of governmental ministries in underscoring the principle of equality between male and female employees in respect of training courses and scholarships, and also, that an increased educational level has an effect insofar as increasing legal knowledge. Officials at governmental ministries should emphasize holding awareness creation courses on the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation, side by side with women organizations with a view to strengthening legal knowledge through the holding of courses and lectures to create awareness of the law. especially among women government employees.

N2  - Background Few studies have investigated tobacco industry interference in the tobacco control policies of Arab nations. This paper explores the tactics used by the industry to subvert tobacco control policies in Oman and offers lessons on how to prevent such interference in the future. Methods We searched the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Archive using the word `Oman', names of government institutions, policymakers and local tobacco distributors. Extracted data were noted chronologically by key elements of tobacco control measures. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Health Ministers' Council resolutions on tobacco control were also reviewed. Results Out of 1020 tobacco documents located, 327 were closely related to policy interference. Documents revealed that the industry met key government officials, offered in-kind services, used local diplomatic missions to influence Omani policymakers, opposed smoking bans, delayed regulations to lower tar and nicotine content of cigarettes, and to require effective health warnings, circumvented a tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship ban and provided voluntary codes as an alternative to effective regulations. Additionally, industry representatives lobbied individual countries in the GCC to veto tax increments and defeat consensus on agreed resolutions of the Health Ministers' Council. Conclusion The tobacco industry interfered in all key public health policies aimed to reduce tobacco use in Oman. There is an urgent need for the Omani government to enforce the Civil Code of Conduct and develop guidelines for all policymakers through implementing Article 5.3 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to curb the tobacco epidemic.

N2  - Constitutional, economic and administrative reforms have generated debates about their unintended consequences in poor and developing countries, and the best way to steer them towards better outcomes. In-depth case study analysis helps in tailoring future reforms and enriches academic literature on countries faced with the complex and intertwined problems of fragility, traditional actors, state building and donor involvement. This paper aims at examining the legacies of state-building and civil service reforms in Yemen by providing a narrative of motivations, outcomes as well as the involved politics and actors. Yemen’s state institutions have evolved from times of colonization and isolation to pass through centralization in the two-state era, reunification, decentralization and reorientation towards merit-based bureaucracy. Yemen’s reform experiences did not result in well-performing administrative and civil service institutions while they were often ad hoc, rushed or born out of political circumstances and donors’ pressure. Alongside the devastating civil war, contemporary state-building challenges result from legacies of reform failures. Current problems are exacerbated by long-standing policies of patronage, but they are also a reflection of the difficult reality of dominance of tribal elites, lack of capacities, interference from regional powers, and disagreements about the future shape of the Yemeni state.

N2  - The state of governance in Bangladesh has a chequered history. The country's battle for independence, and its history of military dictatorships and dysfunctional democracy, have brought challenges in terms of establishing a sound system of governance. The five pillars of public governance have posed formidable obstacles to establishing and reforming key institutions, refining processes and strategies of management and guiding the country towards a more efficient and effective system. Here we analyse the backgrounds of legislators elected to parliament in 1991, 1996 and 2001, legislative accountability, functional mechanisms, and the constraints of regulatory, administrative and economic institutions in order to examine how poor governance practices have created high levels of patronage in return for short-term political gains. We argue that state institutions have been captured by members of a powerful nexus who have developed a symbiotic relationship with the state, affecting its institutional capacity to reduce corruption, strengthen transparency and accountability, and allow the judiciary and public bureaucracy to work professionally.

N1  - Conference on The Challenges and Opportunities of New Immigrant
Destinations, Hartford, CT, OCT 11-12, 2013
N2  - The essays in Part I considered the role of local and regional
governments in integrating immigrants in new destination countries. The
chapters by Dobbs and Caponio and Campomori demonstrated that the
commitment to and character of immigrant integration at the level of
local bureaucrats and political parties varies considerably, depending,
in part, on partisan ideology (Italy) and partisan self-interest
(Ireland). This chapter continues the regional focus in examining the
challenges associated with immigrant integration in the Spanish region
of Catalonia. Wheras Ireland and Italy faced challenges associated with
unprecedented diversity, in Catalonia, immigrant diversity overlays the
preexisting position of Catalans as a distinct ethnic minority group in
Spain. The adoption of bilingual Catalan education was not a response to
immigration, but rather a policy to address indigenous cleavages.
Nevertheless, Alarcon shows that it has important implications for
patterns of immigrant integration.

N2  - Purpose: This paper aims to examine empirical evidence of the criterion, construct, and face validity of two processes commonly used in selection - selection interviews and assessment centres (ACs) - in the selection of chairs of primary care trusts. Design/methodology/approach: A critical review of the literature and an empirical investigation are undertaken. Findings: Evidence is presented of the reliability and the predictive, construct, and face validity of using a combination of selection interviews and AC methodology in appointments to public office. In the light of the evidence of the potential benefits of using more than one approach, it is suggested that a combination of AC methodology and panel interviews be used in making public sector appointments. Practical implications: The evidence presented supports the decision of the Appointment Commission to use AC methodology in the selection for positions in public office, and points to ways in which the process could be improved. Originality/value: The paper provides empirical evidence of the reliability and validity of two methodologies used in selection to posts.

N2  - Interest groups are key intermediary actors between civil society and public officials. The EU has long emphasized the importance of interacting with representative groups that involve their members. Additionally, there is an increasing trend toward the professionalization of groups that invest in organizational capacities to efficiently provide policy expertise. Both member involvement and organizational capacity are crucial features for groups to function as transmission belts that aggregate and transfer the preferences of their members to policymakers, thus reinforcing the legitimacy and efficiency of governance systems. Yet, not all groups have these organizational attributes. This paper quantitatively examines the effects of interest groups' investment in member involvement and organizational capacity on the level of access to EU Commission officials. The results indicate that member involvement does not pay off in terms of higher levels of access. In contrast, groups with high organizational capacities have more meetings with public officials of the Commission.

N2  - The European Commission's outreach to interest groups implies that they function as ‘transmission belts’ that aggregate and articulate interests as policy-relevant information for policy-makers. Operating as a transmission belt, however, requires an organizational design fit for this purpose. We offer one of the first systematic analyses of how organizational design affects interest group access to public officials. We draw from a novel dataset of 248 EU-level interest groups including data on several dimensions of organizational design. One of our key findings is that qualified majority and consensus-facilitating decision-making procedures help interest groups gain access to administrative and political officials, whereas functional differentiation is important to get access to administrative officials, but not to political officials. Our findings thus demonstrate the relevance of organizational design in gaining access as well as the need to incorporate varying informational demands of public officials to properly explain interest group access to public decision-making.

N2  - Nigeria’s godfathers represent a phenomenon that is fundamentally distinct from the typical patterns of ‘big man’ and then ‘strong man’ politics dominant in many parts of Africa since independence. Nigeria’s godfathers grew out of a framework similar to those that produced, and were then influenced by, ‘big men’ like Charles Njonjo in Kenya. But on the basis of research conducted in Nigeria during the past two years, the following pages argue that Nigeria’s present-day godfathers are fundamentally different creatures even from the ‘strong men’ who dominate government institutions in other contexts. Their rising power and influence have also increasingly pushed Nigeria’s polity in uncharted new directions. Since 1999, the public institutions of Nigeria’s Fourth Republic have become increasingly dominated by patterns of uncontrolled criminal activity that have subsumed many of the legitimate aims of government. 1 The result is an undemocratic and often violent perversion of the country’s federal ideals.2 Nigeria’s political system is not authoritarian in the traditional sense of the word. It more closely resembles an ‘electoral autocracy’ (Schedler 2006) where a formal emphasis on elections purports to mask the absence of real accountability and the continuing importance of elite-centered patronage politics. Federalism remains the intellectual core of Nigeria’s political system. But on the ground Nigerian federalism has degenerated into a structure that simply accommodates a multiplicity of decentralized and lawless political spaces - its 36 states and 774 local governments, along with smaller patches of political turf that are not formally delineated.3 The fundamental character of Nigeria’s current political configuration has both created and is reflected in the power, the actions and the proliferation of political godfathers within the country. These godfather’s ‘politics’ focus narrowly around personalized control and enjoyment of some portion of the ŉational cake’ - that is, straightforward access to Nigeria’s oil revenues rather than any broader attempt at establishing political hegemony. While the typical conception of political clientelism implies that the more powerful of two actors provides the lesser powerful with material rewards in exchange for political power (Eisenstadt and Lemarchand 1981), the godfather- protégé relationship postulates the opposite. Nigeria’s political godfathers have no interest in occupying the public offices: they work to dominate these by proxy by filling them with protégés who would be incapable of winning office on their own. Their behavior reflects a perception that government institutions matter only as investments that can yield greater personal wealth and power; it is also assumed that the institutions concerned can be effectively dominated from the outside. Godfathers demand regular financial ‘returns’ from those they install into positions of public confidence. Those returns take the form of money stolen from public coffers by political officeholders - generally either directly or through the awarding of phantom or grossly inflated government contracts - and handed over to the godfathers. Godfathers also typically demand the power to control appointments to government positions that fall within formal remit of their protégés and to ensure that many lucrative contracts are awarded to individuals of their choosing. In effect, godfathers appropriate their sponsored officeholders’ ability to dispense patronage as their own and in doing so create still more protégés who are each sources of additional financial returns to the godfather. The phenomenon is perhaps most pronounced at the state and local levels in Nigeria’s three-tiered system of federalism. Godfathers in Nigeria are also unique in that their relevance and power derives entirely from their proficiency in criminal activity. Godfathers finance gangs of political thugs to rig elections and bribe government and police officials who could stand in the way of their protégés’ success. By doing this they place the politicians they sponsor in a permanent state of debt, and ensure that those debts are repaid with the credible threat of unleashing violence or other forms of criminal retribution against recalcitrant debtor politicians. That government revenues are lucrative enough to be worth fighting for in such brutal fashion is testament to the scale of Nigeria’s centralized stream of government oil revenues and to the weakness of all other sectors of its economy (Lewis 2004; Rotberg 2004).

N2  - Performance and legitimacy are classic themes within the literature of
public bureaucracy. However, much of the academic studies on the subject
in Latin America is still based on conceptual frameworks related to the
functioning of the bureaucracy in the authoritarian periods. In recent
decades, the democratic experience in the region has been consolidating
and represents a rich opportunity for new studies, especially those that
seek to go beyond the analysis of a single national government. Thus,
this paper proposes, based on the analysis of both Chilean and Brazilian
empirical cases, to study two different models of Senior Civil Service
composition, among many existing types, through the case studies of
Altos Directivos Publicos, in Chile, and Especialistas em Politicas
Publicas e Gestao Governamental, in Brazil. The analytical dimensions
adopted are performance and legitimacy and the thesis presented as a
synthesis of the essay is the technification of politics in Chile, and
the politicization of bureaucracy in Brazil, both treated from a
historical perspective. The adopted methodological approach is based on
the exploratory qualitative method, operationalized by literature
review, documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with
bureaucrats.

Although it focus on local government, it has a comparative approach.
N2  - This article argues that bureaucracy plays politics in Indonesia, not only during the electoral periods, but also in public service. Using the case of environmental evaluation in local government, where natural resources comprise most of the local economy, this article discusses the politics of bureaucracy in undergoing daily governing processes. The environment and natural resource businesses are two opposing fields. Environmental evaluation becomes a contentious area and is usually highly political. This article identifies the bureaucracy's politicisation in environmental evaluation as occuring in at least in two forms-in measurement and in project implementation. In terms of measurement, bureaucracy tends to use minimum standards, while in project implementation, there are some occasions where bureaucracy tends to sub-contract the work to the third party, usually NGOs, especially in relations to sensitive issues, so that it is politically safer for them, once the result is not as pleasing as expected. This article uses some cases in Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, Central Java, and Bangka Belitung, and applied case study as research approach.

N2  - Purpose This study aims to explore the opinions of audit committee (AC) members on the extent to which they fulfil the oversight role vested in them by the Jordanian Corporate Governance Code (JCGC). Design/methodology/approach This study uses semi-structured interviews with 18 AC members. Findings The findings suggest that although ACs largely meet the JCGC's recommendations, their substantive oversight role in practice is limited. In particular, the responses indicate that ACs suffer from a lack of real power, especially concerning the appointment (or removal) of external auditors and the evaluation of internal control. Moreover, ACs have no actual role in issues deemed important for financial reporting quality (e.g. reviewing management estimates and evaluating chief financial officer (CFOs) and internal audit executives). Originality/value This study provides rich insights into ACs' oversight processes in a setting outside the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance model where knowledge is scant on the ACs' real function. Hence, the study injects the literature with new qualitative-based evidence from a peculiar civil law country. Also, Jordan has spent time and energy trying to strengthen corporate governance practices to boost investors' confidence. However, the interviewees' responses indicate that the oversight role of the AC is still far from what the regulators anticipate. Therefore, the findings offer useful feedback for regulators to think more deeply about the current governance regulations. The feedback from this study can be extended to other developing countries with similar institutional environments, especially countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

N2  - This article explores the prospect and practice of alternative and more collaborative approaches to environmental governance, focusing on recent North American experience and with particular attention to: (i) characteristic barriers to effective and collaborative environmental governance; (ii) approaches to collaboration and bridging between actors and sectors; and (iii) the potential role of actor agency. The focus of inquiry is primarily on recent North American experience. The key literature on environmental governance is discussed, and interviews conducted with environmental practitioners, academics, government officials and community leaders to explore and analyse their experiences with environmental governance are analysed. Collectively, these experiences suggest that there is a need for more skilful bridging of actors and initiatives, and a greater role for governments in facilitating collaborative approaches. The interviews also point to a number of challenges that must be overcome before the full potential of collaborative environmental governance can be realized. Although some researchers advocate the need for unified and overarching approaches to environmental governance, there is considerable evidence indicating that efforts are better directed towards building networks and collaboration among a wide diversity of actors, philosophies and approaches. © 2008 The Authors Journal Compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Participatory governance is a means of making the state more responsive and accountable to its citizens. However, attempts to involve end users in decision making are often met with considerable resistance not just from political elites, but from the bureaucracy. I investigate how and why bureaucrats resist such reforms by focusing on the implementation of the Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authorities Act (1997) in Pakistan, an Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) program that attempted to put farmers in charge of water allocation, revenue collection, and dispute resolution. Drawing on qualitative interviews conducted in 2015 and 2019 with bureaucrats across the administrative hierarchy and water sector practitioners and consultants, I emphasise the role bureaucratic perceptions and incentives played in driving this program into the ground over two decades. My argument is two-pronged. First, I show that bureaucratic resistance to participatory programs needs to be studied in light of wider political events and processes, particularly patterns of political engagement and parallel attempts at devolving power. Second, I find that the precarious conditions under which irrigation bureaucrats work make them unwilling to cede what official power and influence they do have to farmers. In other words, I contend that bureaucratic resistance to farmers' involvement in decision-making is the result of a more nuanced set of political and bureaucratic experiences than the perceived technical superiority and colonial inheritance of the irrigation bureaucracy. More broadly, my argument has implications for participatory reforms in other sectors and for decentralized government in Pakistan and in other countries in the Global South. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

N1  - Exclusion criteria: provincial level
N2  - How do ruling political parties accommodate their members’ demand for access to state patronage with a push for merit-based bureaucratic reform? I argue that political commitment to reform is contingent on electoral calculations within the party. Therefore, distortions in reform implementation reveal not only dynamics within the party itself, but also the significance of appointing the right bureaucrats to the right posts to regulate access to patronage. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork in Punjab, I contextualise political commitment to bureaucratic reform to provide an explanation for their unsustainability and for persistently low state capacity in countries with weak, patronage-reliant parties.

N2  - Bureaucratic performance varies immensely even within low-capacity states. Politicians and bureaucrats create pockets or networks of effectiveness that allow some departments to perform more efficiently than others. How do these networks develop and how are politicized bureaucratic appointments used to influence performance? Drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in Punjab, Pakistan, this paper argues that politicians and bureaucrats ensure enhanced performance by making legal and extra-legal appointments of hand-picked bureaucrats to key posts. The choice of bureaucrat is made on the basis of carefully curated relationships of patronage established through work, training, and old school networks. As a result, temporary networks of effectiveness are created but rendered unsustainable by the very patronage relationships that create them, preventing them from evolving into more permanent pockets of effectiveness. More broadly, my argument contributes to debates on intra-state capacity and politicization, establishing a link between patterns of staffing and patterns of governance.

critical that we understand how the political world affects career
choices among federal employees. This study proposes a theoretical
framework that integrates the political environment into concepts of
turnover intent among public sector employees based on research
examining open systems and the administrative presidency. The framework
is then explored through interviews with federal employees, former
appointees, and lobbyists to understand the impacts of the broad

N2  - The institution to settle the dispute between individuals is a court of law manned by Judges. To nominate and appoint the judges are herculean tasks which involve processes to ensure only fit and proper persons occupy Judicial Offices. This article examined the constitutional and regulatory procedures for the appointment of Judicial Officers in Nigeria. The study identified the problems associated with the processes of the appointment of the Judicial Officers in Nigeria. The work adopted the socio-legal research method by using the qualitative approach. There is a dearth of literature in Nigeria on how the procedure for the appointment of Judicial Officers operates practically and the real problems associated with the operation of the procedural laws. To achieve the research objectives, a semi-structured interview was used. Three specialists in the Nigerian legal profession were interviewed to find out the actual issues on the ground. The study discovered that lobbying has been entrenched in the process of the appointment of Judicial Officers in Nigeria. The research further found that the powers of the Chief Justice of Nigeria to appoint the majority ofmembers of the recommendation body threatens the independence of the Judiciary.

Exclusion criteria:

- Period: pre-modern Britain
N2  - Prior to the 19th century virtually all European civil appointments were made through outright sale or patronage, and the offices were effectively private property. During the first half of the 19th century almost all of these offices converted to professional bureaucracies with salaried employees. This paper explains the choice over purchase and patronage prior to 1800, and the later transition to professions, using the NIE hypothesis that the crown was interesting in maximizing the value of its offices, and therefore, its own treasury. This hypothesis is tested by examining three branches of the British civil service: the military, judiciary, and treasury.

N2  - Are international courts power-seeking by nature, expanding the reach and scope of international rules and the courts' authority where permissive conditions allow? does expansionist lawmaking require special nurturing? We investigate the relative influences of nature versus nurture by comparing expansionist lawmaking in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the Andean Tribunal of Justice (ATJ), the ECJ's jurisdictional cousin and the third most active international court. We argue that international judges are more likely to become expansionist lawmakers where they are supported by substate interlocutors and compliance constituencies, including government officials, advocacy networks, national judges, and administrative agencies. This comparison of two structurally identical international courts calls into question prevailing explanations of ECJ lawmaking, and it suggests that prevailing scholarship puts too much emphasis on the self-interested power-seeking of judges, the importance of institutional design features, and the preferences of governments to explain lawmaking by international courts.

N2  - The OECD has developed new guidelines to help make lobbying more transparent and even-handed. Lobbying is a channel that civil society uses for influencing public decision-making. The financial and economic crisis has reinforced these concerns. Governments had been rapidly reshaping regulations in the face of cries against business-as-usual and for changes to stop the crisis from happening again. Several OECD countries are at bill stage or are taking action in parliament, including the Czech Republic, Korea, Italy, Mexico, Norway and the Slovak Republic. Policymakers should use the principles to foster integrity by providing guidelines on expected standards of behavior of public officials and lobbyists. The OECD principles on lobbying provide guidance to decision-makers at all levels of government and at both national and sub-national levels. The new lobbying principles are now attracting attention in high-level global policy fora, and have been promoted in the OECD competition forums, the NATO assembly, and others.

N2  - The ``politics of infrastructure{''} reproduces inequality, leaving many
urban residents without access to water, sanitation, and other basic
services. Inner-city residents in Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, have
long coped with poor drainage and waste collection that increases flood
and health risks. Drawing upon a wide range of sources, this study
examines how a system of patronage and partisan politics in Jamaica has
helped to (re)produce this infrastructural deficit that has harmful
effects on many inner-city residents, from independence in 1962 to the
2020 Atlantic hurricane season, the busiest on record. In doing so, it
will enhance understanding of the nature of Jamaican politics at the
local level, highlighting that politics of the Kingston and St Andrew
Corporation (KSAC)-the municipal council-was marked by a continuous
interaction between citizens, councilors, MPs, and civil servants, and
that short-term jobs and contracts were the most important avenues of
patronage

N2  - The U.S. Constitution is clear on the appointment of executive officials: the president nominates, the Senate approves. But on the question of removing those officials, the Constitution is silent—although that silence has not discouraged strenuous efforts to challenge, censure, and even impeach presidents from Andrew Jackson to Bill Clinton. As J. David Alvis, Jeremy D. Bailey, and Flagg Taylor show, the removal power has always been and continues to be a thorny issue, especially as presidential power has expanded dramatically during the past century.

N2  - Organized medicine has battled the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) since the 1970s over enforcement of the antitrust laws. Physicians' discontent stems from the belief that federal policy allows managed care organizations to achieve dominance in health care markets just as it discourages physicians from taking collective action to protect their interests. This article examines two important efforts by organized medicine over a twenty-year interval to alter federal antitrust policy. In 1982, physicians and other professionals sought a special exemption from FTC jurisdiction; beginning in 1998, physicians promoted legislation that would exempt independent practitioners from the antitrust laws for collective bargaining purposes. Both initiatives passed in the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate. This article uses an advocacy coalition framework to reinterpret the events and to assess the reasons for legislative failure. The evidence suggests that in both instances, although twenty years apart, consumer groups and federal bureaucrats determined the outcome in favor of corporate medicine.

N2  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the effects of political connections (PCs) on corporate financial performance (CFP) in an emerging economy. It also investigates the moderating influence of the directors' financial expertise (DFE) on the relationship between politically connected firms and their financial performance. Design/methodology/approach The study sample includes 304 firm-year observations from non-financial Tunisian listed firms covered over 2012-2019. Financial data are from various sources: financial statements, annual reports, official bulletins of the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) and the Financial Market Council. PCs and DFE data are manually collected from the TSE and companies' websites. Multivariate regression analyses are used to test the research hypotheses. Findings The results show that PCs negatively affect CFP and the DFE is a moderator variable that exacerbates this negative relationship. These results could be explained on the one hand by the fact that politicians often lack management, professionalism and know-how. On the other hand, political members on boards focus mainly on their political agendas and prioritize their interests rather than firm performance. Furthermore, board directors are more inclined towards the grabbing-hand approach to create personal linkages with these politicians and take personal benefits rather than protect the interests of minority shareholders and effectively use firm resources. Research limitations/implications The most important limitation of the study is the small number of non-financial TSE-listed firms. Indeed, the small sample size prevents us from considering industry specificities and working in a homogeneous environment. Practical implications This study recommends that external investors pay particular attention to politically connected firms as PCs tend to weaken corporate governance. Also, it helps policymakers better assess the need to harmonize and develop corporate governance standards and practices that account for the specific conditions in Tunisia to mitigate the lobbying of political parties and supervise their abuse of power. Furthermore, the negative relationship between PCs and CFP in a poorly regulated and governed country could be used by financial institutions in their credit scoring. Social implications The findings suggest that the nexus between politics and business draws attention to corruption post-revolution. Originality/value The originality and the relevance of this study consist in studying the moderating effect of the DFE on the association between PCs and CFP. To the best of the author's knowledge, this study pioneers assessing the role of the DFE as a moderating variable. It also supplements prior literature by examining the combined factors, such as PCs and DFE, on CFP in an emerging market.

N2  - Defense ministers are among the most central players in democracies' civil-military relations. This article aims to identify the determinants of the selection criteria of defense ministers in democracies and semi-democracies. More specifically, it attempts to measure the effects of systems of government on decisions to appoint civilians or military officers to head the defense ministry. We argue that some characteristics of presidentialized regimes lead to the appointment of military defense ministers. This is a novel contribution, one that connects the literature on civil-military relations and that on systems of government. To assess our hypothesis and its mechanisms, we use comprehensive cross-national data in 1975-2015. Our tests indicate a robust association between presidentialized systems of government and the appointment of military ministers. We also show that military defense ministers are associated with some relevant outcomes. These findings have important implications for the study of civil-military relations, defense policy, and democracy.

N2  - Comparing Internet diffusion policies in the United States and France from an implementation perspective brings to light institutional and historical differences, even though both countries used the same top-down approach. We find that France not only followed the technological lead of the United States in information technology but also emulated some of its more business-oriented approaches in the implementation of the Internet, despite its own longstanding tradition of government intervention in industrial and commercial matters. This policy shift appears to be spurred by the global economy. Traditionally state-controlled national economies are now increasingly leveraging private interests for successful industrial policy. When applying Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith's advocacy coalition framework to the American and French diffusion of the Internet, we find policy communities actually expanding to private and public actors, including industry captains, legislators, and civil servants. These subsystems work together through classic lawmaking and lobbying under technological and economic constraints.

N2  - Purpose-This article examines Sweden's engagement with the DPRK as a unique case to understand motivations for engaging in a so-called fragile state. Design/methodology/approach-The authors apply the constructivist international relations (IR) approach and opt for the case study method based on semistructured interviews of individuals who have taken part in Swedish engagement programs. Findings-Besides having its embassy in Pyongyang and serving as a protecting power for the U.S., Sweden has provided capacity building programs for North Korean government officials and scholars and has taken part in low-profile human rights advocacy. In short, Sweden is best viewed as a facilitator between DPRK and the outside world. Its motivations are mixed and multiple, including rationalist pursuit of gains and the logic of appropriateness. Practical implications-Useful for policymakers interested in engagement DPRK and other countries with little interaction with the outside world. Originality/value-This case expands our understanding of engagement that is often understood to a great degree as a rationalist affair between the engaging and target states. It also affirms the usefulness of constructivist IR approach in accounting for today's engagement practices involving more stakeholders and less obvious costbenefit calculation. © 2015 McFarland & Company, Inc.

The analysis of the phenomenon of politicization has allowed the identification of three stages: 2000-2004, 2005-2008, 2009-present. Enforcement of the legislation regarding civil service enabled a considerable increase in stability at this level but there is still a dependence of the public function on the political system through legislative changes.

N2  - When and how do movements influence policy change? We examine the dynamics leading up to Kennedy's decision to pursue major civil rights legislation in 1963. This marked a key turning point in shifting the executive branch from a timid and gradualist approach. Although it is widely taken for granted that the civil rights movement propelled this shift, how the movement mattered is less clear. While most protest targeted local economic actors, movement influence was exerted at the national level on political actors. Thus, movement influence was indirect. We focus on the relationship between local movement efforts to desegregate public accommodations (restaurants, movie theaters, hotels, etc.) and federal responses to movement demands. Although exchanges between movement actors and the federal government took place throughout the period, the logic of federal response evolved as political actors sought strategies to minimize racial conflict. Specifically, the Kennedy administration shifted to a dual strategy. First, the Department of Justice attempted to promote "voluntary" desegregation by working with executives of national companies and civic groups. Second, administration officials worked with these same groups to build support for major legislation among key interest groups. This shift toward a more assertive and proactive intervention in civil rights stands in contrast to the pessimism regarding the prospects for federal policy only a few months earlier. We examine the logic of this response including the impact of civil rights protest on the administration's policy proposals. © 2015 Eastern Sociological Society.

The piece draws on the social-movements literature, and the successes and failures of labor law, to show how law can supplement the deficient regimes of campaign finance and lobbying reform and enable lower-income groups to build organizations capable of countervailing the political power of the wealthy. As such, the Article offers a new direction forward for the public-law literature on political power and political inequality. It also offers critical lessons for government officials, organizers, and advocates seeking to respond to the inequalities made painfully evident by the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - The political changes brought about by the sales between 1633 and 1700 proved particularly damaging to royal authority in the Viceroyalty of Peru. For Peru, the tribunal of accounts and the central treasury office in Lima formed the core of the fiscal bureaucracy. The royal treasury played a crucial role in maintaining Spanish power and authority in the Viceroyalty of Peru. Despite the considerable income accruing to the crown from the sale of treasury offices in Peru, opposition to the practice continued in the Council of the Indies. The final indication of the decline in royal authority in Peru was the drop in tax revenue flowing into the viceregal treasury. Although the crown began selling fiscal appointments to gain revenue, the measure ultimately weakened the treasury in Peru and lessened the crown’s power to draw revenue from the viceroyalty.

N2  - The history of the French state has long been overwhelmed by a teleological vision initiated by nineteenth-century liberal writers and emphasizing the long centralizing continuum between monarchic absolutism, ``Jacobin{''} centralization, the Empire and the succession of nineteenth-century political regimes. Following this logic, territorial administration, studied both by historiography and by theorists of classical law, was a fundamental instrument in the long ``conquest{''} of the centre over its peripheries. As an organ of political power, local administration would have had the role of executor and relay between the central power and the provinces/departments, reflecting the binary nature of a pyramidal link composed of subordination and/or contestation. Thus, the modernisation of the state and the growth of the administrative bureaucracy were linked in a joint quest for efficiency and rationality. However, the administrative project of the revolutionaries of 1789, in other words their political conception of the territory, reflects an entirely different logic. Indeed, insofar as the law was envisaged by the first Constituents as the perfect translation of the general will resulting from the sovereignty of the people, its execution was theoretically based on popular consent, which could not be a constraint, even if negotiated. In short, the constitutional project of the early Revolution can be seen as an alternative to the modernising vulgate of the 19th century and as an original political thought that renews the link between sovereignty and territory through the regeneration of the territorial executive power thought as the implementation of political freedom.

N2  - This paper describes Tokyo’s regeneration of informal diplomacy, lobbying, and public relations in Washington during the first fifteen years of the post-World War Two era. Relieved by the Allied Occupation from official responsibility for conduct of Japan’s foreign relations and even denied opportunities for foreign travel and communication, Japan’s conservative national élite worked deftly through American individuals and organizations pursuing compatible agendas to counter Occupation reform efforts they considered excessive or ill-advised. Following recovery of national sovereignty in 1952, Japan’s Lobby managers diversified and expanded their US operations, focusing energy on maintenance of the political status quo in the bilateral economic relationship that had been established at the outset of the Cold War. The Article concludes that Tokyo’s Lobby managers adapted successfully to changes in their domestic and international environments during the early post-war era and provided critical support for Japan’s primary national objective of rapid economic reconstruction and growth.

Time series regressions for the period from 1980 to 2002 and logistic regressions based on votes for the Pressler and the Brown Amendment confirm the significance of these political economic determinants. While in case of the Pressler Amendment, the direct influence of population groups of Indian and Pakistani origins seems to have played a predominant role, the role of ethnic business lobbies appears to have dominated in the context of the Brown Amendment. Time series analysis also provides some evidence for the impact of US business interests based on FDI and exports, but these effects appear to be comparatively small.

N2  - The American politics literature on representation focuses on voters and elected officials, but a growing group of political scientists are arguing that more should be done to study interest groups. Yet there already is a large literature on interest groups, and it has struggled to show evidence of interest group influence. I argue here that the interest group literature’s near-exclusive focus on the federal government has hindered its progress: basic questions have gone unasked, important interest groups have gone underappreciated, and the amount of influence has been underestimated. By studying US subnational policy making, scholars would discover different constellations of interest groups, and they would find that the variation in subnational governments allows for empirical designs that are better able to detect interest group influence when it exists. The payoffs of a subnational focus would be substantial—both for our understanding of interest groups and for the study of political representation.

N2  - It is an established fact that off-cycle elections attract lower voter turnout than on-cycle elections. I argue that the decrease in turnout that accompanies off-cycle election timing creates a strategic opportunity for organized interest groups. Members of interest groups with a large stake in an election outcome turn out at high rates regardless of election timing, and their efforts to mobilize and persuade voters have a greater impact when turnout is low. Consequently, policy made by officials elected in off-cycle elections should be more favorable to the dominant interest group in a polity than policy made by officials elected in on-cycle elections. I test this theory using data on school district elections in the United States, in which teacher unions are the dominant interest group. I find that districts with off-cycle elections pay experienced teachers over 3% more than districts that hold on-cycle elections.

N2  - This paper provides a critical discussion of the research governance approval processes faced in a nationally-funded primary care health service survey. The study is investigating how a range of English primary care organisations are addressing child protection and safeguarding children responsibilities in the light of a wealth of policy directives following publication of the report of Lord Laming's inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbié in 2003. The principal investigator is a member of a local research ethics committee and has a good working knowledge of the Research Governance Framework. However, following multi-centre research ethics committee approval, a whole catalogue of difficulties emerged in gaining research governance approval for this study from primary care organisations.These challenges and our lessons for primary care are outlined in an organisational case study with the intention of generating debate around this fundamental stage in the research process. With the current restructuring of primary care, we believe the time is right to streamline research governance procedures.

N2  - Professor Ijiri expresses a popular viewpoint when he states that the data provided by accountants ‘directly affect the way in which conflicting interests are solved’.1 This paper suggests that there is also a flow of influence in the opposite direction: the development of data is affected by the conflicting interests of its suppliers (management), its consumers (mainly shareholders and creditors), regulatory agencies and accounting bodies. Accordingly, their changing interests are reflected in the changing interpretation of the auditor’s role, i.e., of what is meant by a ‘fair’ view of a ‘company’s affairs’. The main references are the memoranda submitted to, and the reports of, the Company Law Committees in Britain since 1841. The early joint-stock companies, which existed in Britain as far back as 1553,2 rarely communicated formal financial information to external parties.3 Such information was relatively unimportant in the typical company since ownership and control were combined. Creditors, knowing the firm’s owners and relying on the principle of unlimited liability, accepted informal, unaudited financial information.4 Loans were often obtained from intimate business acquaintances, relatives or friends who recognized and trusted the ability and integrity of the owner-managers.5 The early companies were controlled mainly by other mechanisms: maintenance of certain partnership principles (untransferable shares and unlimited liability), direct control by shareholders, and state control.6 The last involved comprehensive investigations by parliamentary committees on petition from proprietors and creditors.7 The formal separation of ownership from management seems to have originated in closely-owned concerns. The information needs of these shareholders were easily satisfied, as they could find out personally how their companies were really faring.8 They usually had some knowledge of the industry; however, as an additional control device, the managers were encouraged to hold a large equity in the company.9 The increasing growth of companies toward the middle of the nineteenth century resulted in the passage of the Companies Act of 1844 to protect the interests of various business groups.10 The contents of the Act were recommended by the Select Committee on Joint-Stock Companies. The evidence presented to the committee by shareholders and creditors of various companies indicated that the special acts (under which companies were incorporated before 1844) generally protected the directors and managers at the expense of the shareholders, and that the shareholders had a great deal of difficulty in getting any knowledge of the state of affairs of the company. It was argued that directors assumed to themselves a power which probably neither their deeds of settlement nor their Acts gave them.11 The 1844 Act required balance sheets to be examined by auditors, and auditors to report ‘whether in their opinion the balance sheet is full and fair… and… exhibits a true and correct view of the company’s affairs’.12 The balance sheet had to show ‘a true statement of the capital stock, credits and property of every description belonging to the company, and the debts due by the company at the date of making such balance sheet, and a distinct view of the profit and loss which shall have arisen on the transactions of the company… '.13 The 1844 Act defined a company as having a capital divided into freely transferable shares; the principle of limited liability was not added until 1856.14 It is interesting, however, that auditing was no longer made compulsory under the 1856 Companies Act. This shift in law is explained by Robert Lowe: ‘having given them [the limited companies] a pattern the state leaves them to manage their own affairs and has no desire to force on these little republics any particular constitution’.15 But the years following the 1856 Act were characterized by speculative ‘manias’.16 Investments again became active in 1863-5, centring around financial, banking, insurance and hotel companies; but then came ‘Black Friday’, 11 May 1866. Of 75 electrical public companies formed between 1881 and 1883, 32 were dead within three years and 36 within five years.17 During the later Victorian period (1870-1900), the capital markets were widened18 but the shareholders’ legal position was weakened. The proprietary interests of shareholders extended only to the receipt of dividends and the return of their capital in case of liquidation.19 Consequently, shareholders began exerting substantial pressure for audited financial information. On the other hand, management attempted to justify secrecy in the name of maintaining the credit status of the company. It defended non-disclosure of detailed information as being in the interests of the shareholders themselves.20 Unsuccessful attempts to introduce compulsory auditing and disclosure of information were made frequently.21 Finally, under the increasing pressures for audited financial information and the increasing intervention of the Government in economic affairs,22 auditing was again made obligatory for joint-stock companies under the 1900 Companies Act.23 By the end of the nineteenth century, the fields in which the company form of organization was used included all branches of the economy.24 Although the present accounting techniques are essentially the product of the second half of the nineteenth century, attributed to the growth of joint-stock companies,25 the 1900 Companies Act does not reflect them. It only requires that balance sheets include details concerning shares issued, and the debts payable in respect of all mortgages and charges which require registration under the Act.26 The Departmental (Law) Committee of 1895 did suggest that such details as the valuation basis of assets and depreciation provisions be disclosed27 but the legislators of the 1900 Act did not accept these suggestions. Demands for such disclosure were made by the London Stock Exchange representative.28 He argued that the valuation of assets on the basis of cost would substantially mislead shareholders.29 But Mr F. Whinney, a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICA) strongly supported ‘historical’ valuation of assets.30 Mr Whinney, an eminent accountant, had been elected for four terms as president of the ICA.31 The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the largest association of accountants in Britain, was established in 1880; by 1890, it was already ‘important commercially and held in respect by Government officials’.32 Even then, the council of the ICA ‘felt it to be imperative to keep watch over legislation affecting commercial interests, and showed increasing activity in tendering advice’.33 The opinion of the ICA had apparently even more influence on the legislators of the 1900 Act than did the recommendations of the Departmental Committee of 1895. The latter body, appointed by the Board of Trade to review the Companies Act, had included ‘experienced accountants’34 such as E. Waterhouse, former president of the ICA. Some of its recommendations were based on the suggestions of Mr F. Whinney, who joined the London Chamber of Commerce in urging that ‘the auditors should certify whether the books have been properly kept’, in addition to expressing their opinion on whether the financial statements reflect a fair view of the company’s affairs ‘as shown by the books of the company’.35 This suggestion was accepted by the Committee, which emphasized that it had been approved by its accountant members.36 But the ICA objected, and suggested the omission of the words ‘have been properly kept’. It added that ‘the auditor is only called in at the end of the period and it is not part of his duty to supervise the bookkeeping of the company… '.37 Another of the committee’s suggestions was that auditors be required to report whether the balance sheet had been drawn up ‘in accordance with the provisions of the Act’.38 This was also opposed by the ICA, because ‘differences of opinion between directors and auditors are not uncommon, and in such cases the provision of the Act would throw a great and onerous additional responsibility on the auditors’.39 This demonstrates the conflicts within the elite of auditors at that time. © (Introduction and Selection) 1979 T.A.

N2  - The aim of this study is to contribute to the construction of a theoretical framework for the subject of public bureaucracy as a political elite in Chile. Through an analysis of their political status and political roles, this research explores the mechanisms used by medium-high level bureaucrats to exert influence in the formulation of public policies. This article analyzes the public management modernization policy (1990-2014). The analysis of interviews with 78 different actors of this policy makes it possible to see the influence middle-level bureaucrats have thanks to their special type of expertise (public policy expertise) that has to do with the career structure, the high level of politicization of Chilean bureaucracy and the type of tasks that are carried out, which would conform a sort of special capital of bureaucrats: the bureaucratic capital.

N2  - Bureaucracy is the machinery through which the aspirations of the state and of its operators are articulated, formulated, and executed. The study presents an overview of the bureaucracy, reviews its evolution, its reforms and transformations as well as engages the salient issues that dominate the discourses on the bureaucracy. Relying on secondary sources of data such as textbooks, journals, official documents, reports, and a discourse analysis, this chapter argues that impartiality, anonymity, and political neutrality are hallmark of bureaucracy, which allows it to function effectively without being encumbered by the vicissitudes of the kaleidoscopic political environment. The finding was that the Nigerian bureaucratic establishment exerts tremendous strain on public overhead expenditure to the detriment of investment in capital project and infrastructure. Rather than draw down the size of the bureaucracy, successive administrations have continued to grow the service as a result of desire to grant political patronage to supporters and acolytes. Considering the endemic corruption that permeates civil service and the entrenched culture of nepotism, this chapter proposes that Nigerian bureaucratic establishment requires much deeper restructuring and a change of mentality and attitude to work than the periodic peripheral reforms seem to offer.

N2  - This Article offers a new response to an old problem in administrative law: how to secure sound, democratically legitimate policies from unelected regulators. The question stems from a principal-agent problem inherent in representative forms of government the possibility that government officials will not act in the public's best interests and it is rarely absent from legal and policy debates. Major regulatory failures and the government's responses to them have renewed its significance in recent years, as agencies implement new laws and adapt old ones, courts review their actions, and the White House and Congress debate proposals for regulatory reform. Traditional models of democratic legitimacy in administrative law focus on agency accountability to elected officials or increasing interest group participation in the regulatory process. These models are valuable but ultimately fall short, largely because their representative nature replicates rather than remedies the core principal-agent problem. More recently, some scholars and reformers have attempted to engage citizens directly in the regulatory process. But these efforts have not circumvented the representation-based problems, and they also suffer from the high costs and other complications of direct democracy that counsel in favor of representative forms of government. This Article introduces a new model for democratic legitimacy, ``direct republicanism,{''} which attempts to combine elements of representative and direct approaches. In a direct republican system, large panels of randomly selected citizens decide policy questions presented to them by government officials. In this way, citizens can act as their own representatives, the principals their own agents. The Article sketches an initial application of direct republicanism to the regulatory process in the form of ``administrative juries.{''}

N2  - Women in New Jersey in 2007 demonstrated outside the Underwood- Memorial Hospital in Woodbury. They demanded to know why two women had died in childbirth following cesarean sections at this hospital within a fifteen-day period.1 They sought, at a minimum, the publication of hospital and obstetrician cesarean rates; their efforts garnered regional media coverage and resulted in-very little. The hospital expressed its regret but did not begin publishing its cesarean rates. Ironically, several months after the protest the hospital received a national award for its childbirth services.2 The limited impact of the protest was characteristic of the difficulties faced by those trying to change the nature of childbirth in the United States and serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by patient advocates when the elements needed for successful advocacy are not present. Traditional interest group theory suggests preconditions for interest group development and involvement in the political system: A sense of felt need among individuals resulting from a shared focus on a common problem. To be successful in political advocacy, such groups need to join or develop an organizational structure that provides the institutional support critical to the long- Term commitment necessary for success. Consensus on an identifiable and, ideally, a simple solution to the problem of concern, and a clear place (bureaucratic entity, legislative branch) to target advocates' efforts, will greatly enhance their venture. As is often the case for childbirth advocates, almost none of these characteristics were part of the New Jersey demonstration. Activists had no leverage over the local hospital they were trying to influence and no connection whatever with the local obstetricians. Government officials were able to view this matter as simply a private tragedy. The case exemplifies childbirth's paradoxical dual status as at once a public and a private issue. Steven Epstein's chapter in this volume describes the various types of success patients have achieved in shaping the conceptualization of disease, research agendas, attitudes of professionals, and government policy. One can find examples of attempts at each of these in the case of childbirth, only they almost invariably fail. Efforts to humanize childbirth were largely co-opted by hospitals' adoption of the form but not the substance of change with the development of birthing centers and childbirth classes.3 Officials met with disdain attempts by activists to shift the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research agenda away from cesarean delivery on maternal request. A successful major effort at state reform of hospital practices-extending postpartum stays-was led not by consumers but by groups representing clinicians. Throughout the debates about childbirth policies and practices, the voices of women themselves have mostly remained silent. Copyright © 2011 by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

N2  - Research on policy entrepreneurs typically identifies these individuals as high-level government officials or actors who lobby such elites, largely ignoring low-rung bureaucrats whose entrepreneurship concerns policy implementation. These lacunae may exist because street-level bureaucracy scholarship does not necessarily expect implementing bureaucrats to be entrepreneurial. This article argues the contrary. The existence of street-level policy entrepreneurship and its influence on policy innovations pursued by public bureaucracies is illuminated via two US state case studies. The cases describe efforts by state bureaucrats to adopt and entrench a science policy innovation for wetland management into regulatory practice.

N2  - Forty years of gender research has ensured that gender is an important category that needs to be taken into account in environmental policy and practice. A great deal of finances and attention are currently being directed to gender in development and environmental organizations. At the same time, as gender research has become more sophisticated and theoretically strong, there is also frustration among academic researchers as well as practitioners and policy makers that it appears to have had a marginal effect on environmental practice on the ground. Policies have turned to gender mainstreaming, attempted to include women and other marginalized social groups in environmental management and markets. Change has been mixed. Mainstreaming can become a technocratic exercise. The assumption that competing interests can be negotiated by adding women to organizations for environmental governance, in disregard for social relations, is problematic. Stereo-types about women and men, sometimes buttressed by gender research predominate in policy and programs. Inclusion in markets offer new options but can further curb women's agency. Contradictions arise - as gender becomes a part of the official machinery, when women are regarded as a collective but addressed as individuals in programs and when the focus is on the governance of gender with little attention on the gender of neoliberal governance. Yet, support for `gender programs' has also led to unintended openings for empowerment. It is clear that the meaning of gender is far from settled and there are intensified efforts to define what `gender' is in each context. I discuss the renewed interest in gender and what this engagement with power might mean for gender research, policy and practice and where we might go from here.

N2  - In this research we tried to analyze the power of influence of economic interest groups since a different perspective, longer than only economic impact. We studied economic interest group from the perspective of its power to influence public administration, where produces a conflict of interest. This text begins defining the concepts of interest, influence and power to reach the concept given by both the doctrine and the Courts of Justice of Costa Rican economic interest groups. Also, the link between these groups and the public power is analyzed, taking into consideration the power of their influence includes the public sector when the action of a public official is clouded by personal interest. From the standpoint of national and international law applicable on conflicts of interest in the government, this paper concludes that it is not enough to identify this situation. As a consequence, this document develops a methodology to determine relationships that could constitute a conflict of interest and a legal reform that it will enable States to develop an effective political against corruption and increase public ethics.

N2  - By introducing the concept of "structural advocacy organizations," this study theorizes and tests the boundary conditions within which organizations designed to protect the rights of disenfranchised groups promote structural changes at the intersection of gender and race. We test these claims on Brazil's "women's police stations," a type of structural advocacy organization with greater female representation on staff and with specialized procedures and an institutional mandate to address violence against women. The analysis indicates that homicides are lower among the population of women in municipalities which have women's police stations. However, within this group, homicides committed against women who self-identify as "black" and "brown" are lower only in municipalities that are characterized by high levels of female education and in metropolitan areas with infrastructure development. The results suggest that improving intersectional outcomes for women who are disenfranchised on race requires complementary policies and institutional mandates to address racialized violence.

N2  - This article sets out to identify a culture of advocacy that has come to characterise Swedish civil society, formed around a long-standing tradition of close and cordial relations between civil society organisations, popular movements, and state and government officials. We argue that Swedish civil society organisations (CSOs) have been allowed to voice critique against public actors and policies and are expected to do so. Based on a large survey of Swedish CSOs, this study contributes unique data on what type of advocacy strategies CSOs practise, and the range of advocacy strategies that organisations employ. The analysis also explores norm-breaking behaviour, such as holding back criticism of public authorities. The results reveal a complex picture of a culture of advocacy: we find patterns of intense political activity among organisations that admit they hold back in their criticism of public authorities and the use of a wide range of advocacy strategies. The article contributes to and challenges established advocacy research and analyses established patterns of organisations' advocacy activities with the symbolic acts of breaking norms, as an analytical approach for the study of advocacy strategies in general and advocacy culture in particular.

N2  - This paper sheds new light on the drivers of civil service reform in US
states. We first demonstrate theoretically that divided government is a
key trigger of civil service reform, providing nuanced predictions for
specific configurations of divided government. We then show empirical
evidence for these predictions using data from the second half of the
20th century: states tended to introduce these reforms under divided
government, and in particular when legislative chambers (rather than
legislature and governor) were divided.

N2  - On the basis of an enormous literature and a large body of research that has accumulated over the past twenty years, the thesis is presented here that - in opposition to the ideal of science and politics as fixed, separate spheres - the relationships among these fields of action in the twentieth century is best described as one of constant interaction and resource exchange. From the standpoint of institutional or social history, this network of relationships is not limited to high level political actors, but involves constantly changing alliances of high ranking scientists with politicians, industrialists, military men or civil servants acting in the relevant government agencies. In addition, and much more important, this relational history involves - or has led to - basic changes in the content of both politics and science. At this level we can speak of two complementary processes: an increasing scientification of politics on the one hand - meaning the tendency to treat political projects as technocratically solvable problems - and a politicization of science on the other hand - meaning the tendency to take on the scientific topics and research issues that appear to be presented by political projects and administrative programmes. Thus, scientists in the twentieth, as well as the twenty-first centuries have not only been servants of politics or opportunists taking the chances that politics appears to offer; often enough they have played significant parts in the formulation and execution of political projects. Examples of all this come from all fields of scientific knowledge. Not only for the natural, medical and technical sciences, but also the social sciences and humanities the statement holds, that this relational history cannot be reduced to the ideologization of supposed value neutral science.

N2  - This article analyses the roles played by patronage and brokerage in an Indonesian district election by focusing on variation in village-level results. Through interviews with village elites, we found that highly uneven village voting patterns were strongly influenced by varying patterns of patronage distribution. The winning candidate (the son of the incumbent) used a state-centred form of patronage involving pork barrel and club goods that proved more effective than gifts distributed through social, specifically religious, networks. Also critical were effective and trustworthy community-level brokers to deliver patronage, with retail vote-buying especially vulnerable to broker predation. Among the four categories of brokers we identified, state brokers-notably village heads-were especially effective at marshalling votes. Our findings underline the importance of patronage in Indonesian elections and the centrality of brokers in clientelistic systems generally. They also help explain the domination of former bureaucrats in electoral contests in regional Indonesia. © 2015 Edward Aspinall and Muhammad Uhaib As'ad.

N2  - Objective: To review tobacco company strategies of using youth smoking prevention programmes to counteract the Malaysian government's tobacco control legislation and efforts in conducting research on youth to market to them. Methods: Systematic keyword and opportunistic website searches of formerly private internal industry documents. Search terms included Malay, cmtm, jaycees, YAS, and direct marketing; 195 relevant documents were identified for this paper. Results: Industry internal documents reveal that youth anti-smoking programmes were launched to offset the government's tobacco control legislation. The programme was seen as a strategy to lobby key politicians and bureaucrats for support in preventing the passage of legislation. However, the industry continued to conduct research on youth, targeted them in marketing, and considered the teenage market vital for its survival. Promotional activities targeting youth were also carried out such as sports, notably football and motor racing, and entertainment events and cash prizes. Small, affordable packs of cigarettes were crucial to reach new smokers. Conclusion: The tobacco industry in Malaysia engaged in duplicitous conduct in regard to youth. By buying into the youth smoking issue it sought to move higher on the moral playing field and strengthen its relationship with government, while at the same time continuing to market to youth. There is no evidence. that industry youth smoking prevention programmes were effective in reducing smoking; however, they were effective in diluting the government's tobacco control legislation.

N2  - BackgroundIndonesia shoulders a significant tobacco burden, with almost two million cases of tobacco-related illnesses and more than two hundred thousand tobacco-related deaths annually. Indonesian tobacco control is progressing but lags behind other countries. Our study evaluates factors that contribute to the slow progress of tobacco policy change in Indonesia from the perspective of tobacco control experts (TCEs).MethodWe conducted qualitative interviews with four international and ten national TCEs, who have been active in tobacco control for at least 5years. Our interview guideline included questions on the current tobacco control situation in Indonesia and explored reasons why tobacco control is progressing so slowly. The interviews were conducted either in English or Bahasa Indonesia, recorded and then transcribed verbatim. We conducted a thematic analysis based on five core causal factors for policy adoption: institutions, networks, socio-economic factors, agendas and ideas.ResultsThe multistage delay of tobacco policy adoption is principally due to political structures and policy hierarchy, complex bureaucracy, unclear roles and responsibilities, and a high degree of corruption. The low bargaining position and lack of respect for the Ministry of Health also contributes. There are contrasting frames of tobacco as a strategic economic asset and tobacco control as a sovereignty threat. There is an imbalance of power and influence between well entrenched and resourced tobacco industry networks compared to relatively young and less established tobacco control networks. The policy agenda is likely influenced by the privileged position of tobacco in Indonesia as a socially acceptable product with high consumption. There are constraints on transferring ideas and evidence to successful policy adoption.ConclusionTobacco companies have substantially influenced both policy decisions and public perceptions, signifying a power imbalance within the government system and broader networks. Acceding to and enforcing the World Health Organization- Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO-FCTC) would enable the Indonesian government to shift the power imbalance towards public health stakeholders. Tobacco control advocates must enhance their network cohesion and embrace other community groups to improve engagement and communication with policymakers.

N2  - The meteoric rise of Islamic non-state actors is arguably the most significant development in the Turkish civil society sphere since the rise to power of the AKP (Justice and Development Party) in 2002. Throughout its tenure, the government has utilised its political power, state resources and legal bureaucracy to boost the number and organisational capacity of Islamic civil society groups. Today, Islamic non-governmental organisations and charities have become partners to the state in social welfare management, resource allocation, poverty alleviation, information politics, and education. Examining the mechanisms of clientelism and patronage that shape the state-civil society relationship in the AKP’s Turkey, the chapter highlights the ways in which authoritarian regimes strategically cultivate associational activity. The findings of the study suggest that, rather than functioning as a self-governing force that provides a counterweight to state power, Islamic civil society in Turkey has contributed to the consolidation of an authoritarian neo-liberal regime.

N2  - Decentralisation is a complex, yet basic feature of health care systems in many countries entailing the transfer of authority or dispersal of power in public planning, management and decision making from higher to lower levels of government. This paper describes the attempts made in Greece from 1923 until today to decentralise its highly centralised health care system, drawing on a thorough documentary analysis of legislative acts and official reports regarding regional health policy. The analysis shows that, although decentralisation has been attempted on several occasions, in the end it was abandoned every time. The first ever implementation of a decentralised system of governance in 2001 was also curtailed, resulting in only minor decentralisation of authority and real powers. It is suggested that decentralisation has been impeded by many factors, especially obstruction by opposition from key interest groups, absence of policy continuity between governments, the inability to tackle the bureaucratic and highly centralised system and lack of political will.

N2  - This article examines whether states shirked enforcement responsibilities in their principal-agent relationship with the federal government when implementing a delegated environmental program. It evaluates determinants of environmental enforcement stringency, particularly whether penalties were less when imposed by states than by the federal government. It analyzes 6,048 hazardous waste administrative penalties across 32 states and all U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regions over 14 years. It finds that state penalties are typically substantially lower than federal penalties, and that penalty amounts are typically also related to the partisan composition of elected officials and the characteristics of enforcement actions, such as the type, seriousness, and number of violations. Factors such as the influence of organized interest groups, agency sensitivity to economic conditions or the economic importance of regulated industries, and environmentalist preferences of elected officials and the public are typically unrelated to enforcement stringency.

N2  - The article empirically checks the hypothesis about weak discipline of following the regulations and procedures by civil servants in federal and regional public administrations due to insufficient level of salaries and significance of patronage links for carrier promotion, rather than qualitative work. The research showed that despite the original hypothesis, civil servants have a high enough level of labor motivation on the whole, irrelatively to salaries and carrier connections. Their labor motivation is based on carrying out assigned tasks on time and widely spread practice to work overtime and on weekends and holidays. The results of research allow to distinguish such factors of labor motivation as social status, stability and reliability of the occupation, if to compare with by far higher instability of employment in private business, self-realization and deserved carrier promotion (primarily for younger respondents) as heads of departments, or connection with something great - serving for the good of the country, social (civil) service. Under-pay for employees of the lowest and middle levels brings about staff flow (instability), thus decreasing the significance of motivation. Paradoxically though, this attracts people to pubic administration for whom salary does not matter much. At the same time high motivation and work ethics do not result in effective work and performance, especially when it concerns fulfilling tasks and directives.

N2  - This chapter examines the structure and basic tenets of the Egyptian regime, discuss the various challenges facing it, and assess its durability. The authoritarian principle still plays a dominant role in the Egyptian system. The president is the author of all important decisions in domestic and foreign matters and makes all major appointments to civilian and military posts. Egypt has long been viewed as a classical model of an “hydraulic society.” Traditional concepts, shaped by geography and Islamic teachings, combine to give the head of the Egyptian state a unique standing. In post-revolutionary Egypt, the notion of charisma has been synonymous with Nasser. Husni Mubarak inherited the leadership of Egypt after a long and exhausting period of intensive political action. The civil bureaucracy, another pillar of the regime, is an hierarchical system of ministries, agencies, and branches administered by the president’s appointed officials and their subordinates.

N2  - The purpose of this research is to analyze the performance of the State Civil Service Commission of the Republic of Indonesia with the Sabah Public Service Service of Malaysia. Previous research indicates that Malaysia has a superior governance system compared to Indonesia. To support the performance of civil servants, Malaysia has the Sabah Public Service Center. This institution performs a supervisory role and is also involved in career development. Malaysia ranked third in quality of governance among ASEAN countries as it always upholds the principles of professionalism. Although Malaysia previously had a reputation of corrupt practices, the Malaysian government immediately took measures to restore the country's image. Whereas in Indonesia, since regional autonomy, practices of corruption and politicization of the bureaucracy have always stigmatized the government both at central and regional levels. Although the State Civil Service Commission (KASN) is responsible for recruiting and developing a bureaucratic career, there are still practices of bribery and corruption. This provides the theoretical basis for comparing the performance of KASN with Malaysia's Suruhanjaya Ordinary Service. The purpose of this research to provide recommendations to the government in order to formulate policies to govern KASN. The result of this research paper will allow the government to address various historic issues related to recruitment and career development of ASN.

N2  - The current lobbying regulation system in the EU (the EP and the EC), in the form of the official documentation, lacks in many ways according to the project of International Standards for Lobbying Regulation. According to this project, the system is the strongest in its regulatory scope and transparency, and the weakest in the areas of oversight, sanctions, and integrity. The outcome of our analysis is in accordance with the EU's voluntary and self-regulatory system. The analysis has also shown that the European Commission fulfils over 50 % of the established standards. In contrast, the European Parliament fulfils less than 50 %. There is definitely a large space for improvement for both of these EU institutions, especially in the areas of integrity, participation, and access. The main problems of the Union regulation are inconsistency, a voluntary transparency register, the insufficiency of the data provided in the register, the absence of an independent oversight institution and stricter sanctions, and the lenient use of legislative footprints. © 2018 Institute of International Relations.

N2  - In this article the results of the research on the turnover and politicisation of senior career civil servants (in particular, secretaries, state secretaries and chancellors) in Lithuanian ministries in the period of 2001-2015 are presented. The research revealed that over the analysed period the average extent of politicisation of ministerial senior career civil servants amounted to 39%, while the total share of politicised servants varied between 25% and 45%. Evidence shows that demand-side factors, such as the scale of alteration of ruling majorities or alteration of parties holding minister portfolio, are insufficient to explain the turnover and politicisation of senior career civil servants in ministries. In contrast, supply-side factors, namely the existence of suitable partisan candidates to fill high-ranking positions in the ministries and opportunities for politicisation, have higher explanatory power. In addition, the negative relationship between structural and de facto politicisation, as well as the positive relationship between the amount of state budget allocations for institutions and agencies in the minister's field of activity and the degree of politicisation of senior career civil service in the respective ministries was identified. © Aušra Baceviciute, 2015.

N2  - This article contributes to the literature on the politicization of appointments to increase political control over public bureaucracies with often substantial managerial and policy autonomy. Using data from a large-scale executive survey from central government ministries and agencies in 18 European countries, the article provides a comprehensive cross-national and cross-organizational analysis of the autonomy-politicization conundrum and the drivers of the politicization of senior-level appointments. We find that national patterns of politicization correspond fairly well to country families as defined by administrative traditions, with some traditions being more coherent than others. At the organizational level, we find no evidence of efforts by politicians to compensate for extended autonomy by politicizing senior-level appointments, yet we provide evidence of differential effects of both formal and informal organizational characteristics on patterns of politicization. Our analyses show that politicization of senior appointments is lower in organizations with agency status, higher organizational social capital, higher financial autonomy and more extensive use of management tools. The article thereby not only offers comprehensive evidence of cross-country differences in politicization; it also adds to the literature on sub-national variation, by fleshing out an organizational perspective to the study of politicized appointments in the European context.

N2  - Having experienced benign neglect and inertia since the last major set of reforms when all public and subvented hospitals were corporatised in the early 1990s, Hong Kong's health system now faces another round of consultation about reform. This book provides a significant contribution to the discussions about the future of the system. The evidence-driven content draws from the deep expertise and experience of a wide spectrum of contributors, who represent virtually all relevant areas of the health system. Their multidisciplinary input, based on moral philosophy, political economy, macro-financing, health services research, business strategy and patients' experience, reveals areas that require urgent attention and focuses on the issues that matter most if Hong Kong is to achieve better population health through the health system. This book meets the critical need of students, academics, health care professionals, government officials, politicians, and the general public who have been struggling with how best to approach and understand the context and need for change. This book is a project of the Medical and Health Research Network, The University of Hong Kong. The Network, a University-wide multidisciplinary think tank, was established in 1999 in response to the release of the Harvard Report. Its research core members are academics in the fields of clinical medicine and nursing, public health, social work, statistics and actuarial science, economics and finance. It further draws from the wider policy and practice communities in its education, training and advocacy activities. Its mission is to collect, analyse, synthesise and disseminate evidence related to health, long-term and social care in Hong Kong and East Asia. © Hong Kong University Press 2006.

N2  - The concept of brain drain includes not only a physical emigration of highly qualified persons from one country to another but also a transfer from one department of an organization to another, as well as any other loss of skills and knowledge of one economic unit necessary for economic growth and development in favour of another economic unit. Brian drain occurs as a result of the factors of attraction and repulsion of migration of qualified specialists, scientists and students. Three levels of the reason for brain can be distinguished: individual, organization, and state. Brain drain occurs in all countries of the world with a varying extent and character. In the economically developed countries more attention is given to the problem of brain drain. It has become an object of interest and research in these countries much earlier than in the economies of transition. This can be proven by a more extensive and accurate statistics provided in different sources, as well as the abundance of different research. In Lithuania little analysis has been made on this phenomenon. It is difficult to determine the extent of brain drain from Lithuania due to the lack of statistical data and sociological research. The article underlines that the emigration of highly educated specialists from Lithuania may have negative economic, social, cultural and even political effects on the development of the country. Several social groups of Lithuania sensitive to the phenomenon of emigration have been listed in this article. It analyses the migration trends of business world, academic youth, scientists, as well as other highly qualified specialists and civil servants. It is stated in the article that the emigration of specialists from Lithuania is not massive, since the demand of qualified labour abroad is smaller than that of unqualified; however, high qualification and professional competence of workers from both public and private sector becomes a precondition of brain drain from Lithuania to other countries. The article provides the results of the research on the attitudes to migration by civil servants. The majority of the respondents who leave Lithuania are interested not only in the financial benefit; they associate their work abroad with the possibility to satisfy personal needs, first of all self-actualization, career, and professional development. The article maintains that high competence of specialists and knowledge acquired in Lithuania can be easily transferred abroad and this is what encourages the respondents to emigrate. Highly qualified specialists often find a job in their speciality and are satisfied with the evaluation of their work abroad. The analysis of the literature and the study into the migration of civil servants has given theoretical and empirical grounds to the above statement.

N2  - Born out of a Reagan-era desire to minimize regulatory costs, and not fundamentally reconsidered since its inception, the centralized review of agency rulemakings has arguably become the most important institutional feature of the regulatory state. Yet it is a puzzling feature: Although centralized review is sometimes justified on the ground it could harmonize the uncoordinated sprawl of the federal bureaucracy, the agency tasked with regulatory review, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has never embraced that role, ft has instead doggedly clung to its original cost-reduction mission, justifying its function as a check on the federal bureaucracy with reference to the pervasive belief that agencies will systematically ovenegulate. This Article shows why that belief is wrong. The claim that agencies are systematically biased in favor of regulation finds little support in public choice theory, the political science literature, or elsewhere. In any event, theories predicting rampant overregulation are no more plausible than alternative theories suggesting that agencies will routinely underregulate. Even if zealous agencies captured by powerful interest groups did characterize the regulatory state, OMB review is a curious and poorly designed counterweight. There is no reason to believe that OMB's location in the Executive Office of the President will inoculate OMB from the pathologies that afflict other agencies, and some reason to think that it will exacerbate them. As a response to these problems, we urge a reconsideration of the foundational role that centralized review should play in our regulatory state, and a revival and reconceptualization of the neglected principles of harmonization that once ostensibly animated the call for centralized review of administrative action.

N2  - Fiscal decentralization introduced as part of China's economic reform since 1979 has unleashed strong incentives for China's local governments to pursue economic development, but the same incentives have also led to local protectionist policies inhibiting the process of regional specialization. This paper focuses on the constraints or freedom with which local governments can implement their protectionist policies. Using a panel data of 29 China's regions over the time period of 1985-1997, we find that China's political system of bureaucratic integration (specifically, concurrent appointment of local government officials in the central government) imposes constraints on the local governments from practicing protectionism. We also find that the effectiveness of local protectionist policies is limited by market competition, specifically, competition from foreign-invested firms operating in China and foreign imports. Our results on the role of local protectionism remain robust to controls for the regional variations in the size of the economy and the stage of economic development.

N2  - Given their long tenure and broad powers, Supreme Court justices are among the most powerful actors in American politics. In this paper, we present a model of the nomination process that highlights the how uncertainty about a potential justice's preferences can lead a president to prefer a nominee with extreme preferences. In certain cases, Senators may also prefer extreme nominees, leading to the nomination and confirmation of justices whose preferences seem to diverge from those of elected officials. While our focus in this paper is on the Supreme Court, the analysis extends in many ways to other multimember appointed bodies as well.

N2  - Previous research has concluded that ownership of economic resources that are politically valued leads to preferential outcomes during interactions with government officials. However, how the political context, and specifically the roles of the government actors involved, influences the relationship between political valued resources (PVRs) and desired outcomes has to date been relatively unexplored. In our paper, we argue that in interactions with elected legislators, PVRs are much more likely to lead to preferential outcomes. Conversely, due to the lack of power these resources have with bureaucrats in charge of regulatory enforcement, PVRs are less likely to lead to preferential outcomes. We provide some support for our arguments by looking for shifting patterns of effects in outcome variables that typically fall under the jurisdiction of each political role type. We find that large firms, export firms, and technology firms largely report having favorable influence over laws and regulations due to lobbying and increased foreign ownership, while also spending more days in inspections and more managerial time dealing with regulations.

N2  - The chapter explores how corporate/private entrepreneurs try to move, beyond generating profits and providing employment opportunities, to create an enhanced role for themselves by influencing the decision-making processes of the local self-government. Simultaneously, politicians and bureaucrats have recognised that the corporate/private sector can have an increased role in urban policy formulation and planning for promoting brand ‘Bengaluru’. In Bengaluru, they are now actively supported by elitist NGOs, and they wield their collective might, lobbying for policy changes in various speculative mega-developmental local projects. Such planned interventions in investment and urban renewal projects are conceived by national- and state-level task forces, vision group networks and consultants redefining Bengaluru’s urban entrepreneurialism and its form of ‘competitiveness’. Therefore, the chapter seeks to illustrate how the democratic processes have been violated to implement such entrepreneurial development projects like the examples of Bombay First and the Confederation of Indian Industry and also Tender SURE road projects in Bengaluru.

N2  - From Sanitary Hegemony to Liberal Dominance: Investigating the Factors that Prevented a Liberal Inflection at the National Health Agency-ANS (2004-2014) This paper analyzes the policy on supplementary health regulation conducted by the National Health Insurance Agency – ANS, in the Portuguese acronym. We investigated how power disputes between sanitarians and liberals were transposed to the agency through political appointments to management positions and how this influenced the institution’s regulation between 2000 and 2014. To characterize the political groups in the different administrations, we built networks of connections between politicians and ANS directors, examined the role of health insurance companies in supporting ANS leaders, as well as the profile of directors. To identify regulatory outcomes, we analyzed key decisions made and the voting pattern of directors. The research, based on mixed methods, used document analysis and interviews with 45 key actors in the sector, which were the basis for network analysis. The study revealed that after a period of sanitary domination, the most liberal groups in the ANS became the majority. However, these changes in the board did not result in pro-market regulations. This is explained by the political game, as well as by institutional and sectoral factors such as the lack of consensus in the market, the sanitary bureaucracy of the ANS, which acted as a brake on liberalizing measures, and the regulatory framework, which limits the power of the ANS regarding pro-market actions.

N2  - Sri Mulyani's resignation as finance minister in May disturbed markets and aroused concern about the government's commitment to reform. This concern was partly alleviated by the appointment of two well-respected individuals as finance minister and deputy finance minister. Further progress with reform will depend heavily on this new team and other key officials. Strong presidential support will also be needed to resist attempts by parliament to interfere excessively with the finance ministry's work. The economy continued its steady recovery from the impact of the global financial crisis (GFC), but the recovery could still be jeopardised if sovereign debt concerns in Europe persist and block the rebound in global trade and commodity prices. Inflation continues to accelerate, suggesting little room for complacency on monetary policy. Fiscal policy, on the other hand, remains conservative. The higher deficit in the revised 2010 budget is not excessive, and is unlikely to be realised in any case. The real budget challenge is to spend budgeted amounts fully and well. The new five-year plan is also conservative and does little to clarify spending priorities, including for the president's `connectivity' agenda. Despite the GFC, poverty continued to decline, thanks largely to the uninterrupted expansion of GDP and to cash transfers to the poor. Unemployment also continued to fall, although particular groups suffered slight increases in unemployment (young workers 15-25 years old) and somewhat larger reductions in working hours (urban, non-poor, and male-headed households). Nevertheless the large and sustained deceleration of manufacturing growth and the closely related dramatic shift of employment from the formal to the informal sector provide cause for concern. Distortionary labour market policies may help to explain both. A new mining law significantly alters the legal environment for firms in this industry, and also introduces long discredited policies intended to `increase value added' by requiring the domestic processing of minerals. A new law on local government taxes attempts to reduce uncertainty for citizens and investors, but the nature of overall spending by local governments is of much greater importance for the investment climate. The central government has recently been seeking to restore the role of the `missing intermediate' level of government and to boost the centre's indirect control over local governments through provincial governments and governors. This strategy is unlikely to succeed, but it highlights the conflicting requirements for provincial governors to act as agents of the central government while also being accountable to their provincial electorates.

N2  - Background: The aggressive marketing of breastmilk substitutes (BMS) reduces breastfeeding, and harms child and maternal health globally. Yet forty years after the World Health Assembly adopted the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (The Code), many countries are still to fully implement its provisions into national law. Furthermore, despite The Code, commercial milk formula (CMF) markets have markedly expanded. In this paper, we adopt the Philippines as a case study to understand the battle for national Code implementation. In particular, we investigate the market and political strategies used by the baby food industry to shape the country’s ‘first-food system’, and in doing so, promote and sustain CMF consumption. We further investigate how breastfeeding coalitions and advocates have resisted these strategies, and generated political commitment for a world-leading breastfeeding policy framework and protection law (the ‘Milk Code’). We used a case study design and process tracing method, drawing from documentary and interview data. Results: The decline in breastfeeding in the Philippines in the mid-twentieth Century associated with intensive BMS marketing via health systems and consumer advertising. As regulations tightened, the industry more aggressively promoted CMFs for older infants and young children, thereby ‘marketing around’ the Milk Code. It established front groups to implement political strategies intended to weaken the country’s breastfeeding policy framework while also fostering a favourable image. This included lobbying government officials and international organizations, emphasising its economic importance and threats to foreign investment and trade, direct litigation against the government, messaging that framed marketing in terms of women’s choice and empowerment, and forging partnerships. A resurgence in breastfeeding from the mid-1980s onwards reflected strengthening political commitment for a national breastfeeding policy framework and Milk Code, resulting in-turn, from collective actions by breastfeeding coalitions, advocates and mothers. Conclusion: The Philippines illustrates the continuing battle for worldwide Code implementation, and in particular, how the baby food industry uses and adapts its market and political practices to promote and sustain CMF markets. Our results demonstrate that this industry’s political practices require much greater scrutiny. Furthermore, that mobilizing breastfeeding coalitions, advocacy groups and mothers is crucial to continually strengthen and protect national breastfeeding policy frameworks and Code implementation. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - The article deals with the issue of personnel recruitment of the ``gendarme supervision{''} on the private gold mining by officers in the second quarter of the 19th century. The main sources were unpublished materials of the III Department of the Imperial Chancellery and the Headquarters of the Gendarmerie from the State Archives of the Russian Federation, and imperial legal acts. The study of the appointing officers to positions with special powers to oversee extractive gold mining industry was not carried out before. Gendarmes with special powers to supervise the Siberian private gold industry (in the 1840s and 1850s) and the commanders of the gendarmerie districts in Siberia (in the 1830s and 1860s) were included in the studied subject group. It was determined that the posts of ``special officers{''} on gold mining were appointed for a long time. Commanders of Siberian gendarme district might not have experience of service in this region, but two of the four gendarme generals previously served in Siberia. They had the power to supervise the private gold mining. It was revealed that there were no special requirements in training or service experience in other state bodies of Russian Empire related to the counteraction of economic crimes to the officers by the main departments of Russian gendarmerie (Headquarters of the Gendarmerie Corps). Moreover, these requirements were not considered when appointing for a vacancy. In addition, officers who were given special assignments related to the rule monitoring in gold mines might not even have a long experience of serving in the Gendarmerie Corps. As to the question of belonging to a certain class of nobility, the study showed that the gendarme officers in Siberia were either landless or landhungry imperial aristocrats. In the study of service trajectories of each officer, it was found that for most of them the appointment to Siberia was the end of a career at a fairly mature age. This circumstance could also have an effect on the objectivity in the nature of the actions of gendarme officers forced during service in conflict situations with other representatives of the provincial bureaucracy. The author of the article concluded that the exercise of powers delegated to the Gendarmerie Corps for the supervision of private gold mining industry did not have a systematic and adequate personnel policy. This factor was also one of the obstacles to the formation of mining police on the basis of the Corps of Gendarmes in the form of a paramilitary police subordinate to the Chancery of Russian Emperor.

N2  - It has been suggested that the Canadian prime minister tends to enjoy
powers to a degree that is unhealthy in a democratic society. This
article evaluates the ``prime minister as autocrat{''} argument that has
gained currency, if not in the academic literature, certainly in the
popular media. It is suggested that while there has been a relative
increase in the concentration of power in the centre - the centre
defined as the prime minister, his entourage and key central agencies -
the portrait of prime ministerial autocracy has been overdrawn. None the
less, reforms are desirable. Particularly ones that create or enhance
counterweights to prime ministerial power will likely improve Canadian
democracy. These reforms should focus not so much on strengthening the
role of individual MP's but on reinforcing the position of cabinet, the
parliamentary caucus and senate vis-a-vis the prime minister. In this
respect, five possible reforms are discussed, and their prospects of
being adopted assessed: proportional representation for the House of
Commons, an elected senate, strengthened parliamentary caucuses, a fixed
time-table for elections and the New Zealand approach to the appointment
of senior officials.

N2  - Background: Promoting rural women’s agricultural entrepreneurship in the Global South has become a major policy and program priority for governments and development partners. Women’s income earning is viewed as a pathway to their empowerment and gender equality. The research goal was to understand how patriarchal socio-cultural norms and practices influence women’s participation in commercial vegetable farming (CVF) in the mid-hills of Sudurpashchim Pradesh, Nepal, and identify the specific and evolving strategies that women use to negotiate these changes. Methodology: Data for the study were generated through in-depth interviews with 16 smallholder couples, eight each in Dadeldhura and Achham districts. Additionally, 17 key informants who were government agency and development organization agriculture support officials at the district and national level were interviewed. Besides in-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) with women’s groups, women leaders, development actors, and government officials at district, regional, and national level were also conducted. Interview data analysis using NVivo was complemented with field notes, observations and government agency and development organization reports. Results: CVF possibilities initially motivated a few women to discuss with their husbands, organize self-help groups, and seek development program subsidies. With strong support from husbands and parents-in-law, they actively engage in CVF, generate income, form cooperatives for savings and credit, and improve household food security and their own economic status. CVF-associated groups, cooperatives, meetings, exposure visits, skill development training, knowledge sharing, counseling, and advocacy are vital tools. Through them, women build self-confidence, contest and transform entrenched socio-cultural barriers, and negotiate new socio-cultural norms and practices within and outside the household. Dissolving gender stereotypes regarding the division of labor in CVF plays a significant role in encouraging more women to join CVF and increases gender parity. However, a diminishing minority of women still struggle to overcome the legacy of prior negative experiences and subconsciously fear community backlash, especially regarding extended travel outside their village. Conclusion: Socio-cultural practices restricting women’s income-generating roles can be transformed through investment in women’s group initiatives, enhancing husbands’ and wives’ communication and livelihood planning, and community members increased appreciation for women’s role in contributing household income and food security. © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - In this article, we compare bureaucratic change in the European Commission with developments in the public administrations of the member states of the European Union using two standard features of the study of comparative public administration: the degree of politicisation of the higher management and the degree of openness of the career system. The empirical data shows that the Commission started as a public administration in the Continental tradition and over time partially moved towards the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian models. At the same time, the majority of the member states remained rather stable with regard to their position along the two administrative dimensions under study. We argue that none of the mechanisms commonly invoked to explain organisational change - functional adaptation, path dependency, isomorphism or policy windows - can convincingly account for the complete pattern and the magnitude of change that we observe in the case of the European Commission. While we find no convincing support for the relevance of functional adaptation or path dependency, the concepts of isomorphism and policy windows provide a more promising basis for understanding at least some aspects of the empirical development.

N2  - Although state resistance to federal mandates is a prevalent characteristic of contemporary American federalism, little is known about the factors that separate resisting states from states that do not oppose federal policy. This article examines state resistance through a framework that classifies public policies by salience and complexity and identifies societal interests and government officials who are hypothesised to influence policy making on issues of varying types. These hypotheses are investigated in the context of state resistance to four federal laws - the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, No Child Left Behind Act, Help America Vote Act and REAL ID Act. The results of the statistical analysis demonstrate the centrality of the characteristics of citizens, elected officials and specialised interest groups in conditioning state resistance to federal mandates. These results suggest that state resistance can be characterised as a strategic response to federal mandates that varies systematically across types of public policies.

N2  - This paper presents the broad political debate and politics of water management. It argues that the politics in water could be understood at different levels. However, the dominant interest groups reinforce current thinking from one level to another level. Overall, these groups' interest coincide that helps maintain status quo in water sector. This also helps the water resources department to maintain power and authority to remain dominant and resilient in the water sector. The real reform in water sector could only be brought through reorienting water resources departments such that a space is created for meaningful participation of local bodies. Absence of reorientation would only lead to compounding the problems. Thus, the current reforms in the Indian irrigation sector could at best be described as procedural reform and the irrigation bureaucracy is repositioning itself. The State after passing Acts and Rules, tries to create space for the participation of water users in the operation and maintenance of the water distribution systems only to reduce their burden and cost. The irrigation department remains firmly in control of the decision-making process and resources. It continues to remain unaccountable to water users and their institutions. The Irrigation Department determines the degree of people's participation. The current political economy and contestation to capture fresh water also reinforce the process, where the industrialists, municipalities and the powerful farmers' lobby garner the larger share of fresh water. These powerful groups along with the irrigation bureaucracy have a strong interest to maintain status quo. Reform in water sector in India needs restructuring of irrigation bureaucracy making them more accountable and transparent and balancing of power between farmers organisation and irrigation bureaucracy. The new water policy announced by the Government of India on April 2001 also does not create conditions to meet these expectations. Irrigation bureaucracy has been able to retain its authority and superiority in water sector. Thus, the sustainable water management is possible only through emphasising on equity related issues and catering to the needs of the poor, underprivileged small, marginal farmers and slum dwellers and those who are not supported by the existing dominant coalitions.

N2  - Several critical studies in accounting have approached the introduction of accounting systems in the public sector in terms of enforcing and sustaining competition-based resource allocation mechanisms. In this study, we reverse the question and ask: why has accounting not been used in certain public bureaucracies as much as it might? We investigate the extent to which accounting systems have been used in the management of the Greek National Health System (ESY) and find that accounting has played a marginal role in its development. Attempting to explain this puzzling feature we first note and then contrast the main underlying features of accounting systems with those of the Greek political system in general, and ESY in particular. Briefly, our explanation is that the historically high politicization that has characterized the Greek political system has tended to overshadow the economic-cum-managerial dimension of running public bureaucracies, favouring overtly political evaluation criteria of organizational and individual performance. In such an institutional environment, accounting has low symbolic significance and its use does not contribute to enhancing organizational legitimacy - hence its marginal role.

N2  - Interest groups face many choices when lobbying: when, who, and how to lobby. We study interest group lobbying across two stages of regulatory policymaking: the congressional and agency rulemaking stages. We investigate how the Securities and Exchange Commission responds to interest groups at the end of these stages using a new, comprehensive lobbying dataset on the Dodd-Frank Act. Our approach examines citations in the SEC's final rules which reference and acknowledge the lobbying activities of specific interest groups. We find that more than 2,900 organizations engaged in different types of lobbying activities either during the congressional bill stage, the agency rulemaking stage, or both. Meetings with the SEC and hiring former SEC employees are strongly associated with the citation of an organization in a final rule. Comments submitted by trade associations and members of Congress are cited more in a final rule compared to other organizations. While there is more variety in the types of organizations who lobby the bureaucracy than those who lobby Congress, presence does not necessarily lead to recognition or influence.

N2  - Does more citizen participation necessarily improve the democratic quality and/or the effectiveness of government? What forms of participation have the potential to accomplish these goals? And, more important, how can these participatory mechanisms be integrated into traditional representative and bureaucratic governance practices, in order to grasp this potential? We discuss these questions in the article, building on theories and empirical evidence provided by both political science and public administration studies. The conclusion we reach is that participatory empowered mechanisms, such as popular initiatives and referendums, and public–private co-governance councils, have a clear potential to enhance the effectiveness and responsiveness of public governance. However, we also find that in order to secure these benefits and not compromise equality and accountability, the introduction of these mechanisms needs to come together with strong and highly representative legislatures, and with reforms that align the powers and increase the representativeness of interest groups.

N2  - The health systems of Germany and France seem to face similar problems. At the same time there are major differences between the French majoritarian political system and the German consensus democracy. Therefore the health policy networks of both countries differ fundamentally despite of similar interest groups. The comparison of both health policy networks shows, that French health reforms are mainly initiated by civil servants while in Germany the political parties and external advisors play the most important roles. Both countries show increasing fragmentation and pluralization of interest organizations. Nonetheless these changes lead to different governance forms: In Germany the state increased its direct opportunity to introduce major political changes. In France on the other hand radical veto players have increased their influence. Therefore the comparison of both countries indicates that the French majoritarian political system may produce more effective veto players than the German consensus democracy.

N2  - Community participation remains central to development policy; but so do concerns that negotiations to achieve it have become a drill devoid of real meaning. Repeatedly, development interventions fail to unlock its presumed benefits: low-cost innovation, good governance and sustainability. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) in Pakistan, a well-known case of organic community participation, this article demonstrates that the ability to buy consent in the case of donor-funded projects erodes the capacity for real community negotiations to take place. The article argues for closer study of cases such as OPP, known for their strong element of community embeddedness, to understand where things go wrong in aid-induced community participatory projects. It shows how constant negotiations within the community that allowed for the building of trust, the merging of local and technical knowledge, the trialling and adjustments of interventions, and patient lobbying of government officials and field staff are key to unlocking the real benefits of community participation and ensuring social accountability on the part of government agencies. The quick fixes encouraged under development projects, which normally rely on material incentives to generate co-operation, undermine these very principles leading to growing evidence of failure of aid-induced community participatory projects.

N2  - This paper studies the impact of lobbying on policies in a centrally managed water economy. First, we develop an optimal control model in which long-run water-management policies are an outcome of negotiation between policymakers and a politically organized farming sector. We show that under equilibrium conditions in the political game, larger political power of the farmers' lobby leads to faster exhaustion of naturally replenished water resources, and expedites the investment in water-supply backstop technologies such as desalination. Then, we employ a detailed hydro-economic model of Israel's water economy to assess the validity of claims by scientists and bureaucrats that lobbying by the local agricultural sector has contributed to the depletion of the country's natural freshwater resources and thus accelerated the development of seawater desalination. Specifically, we compare observed trajectories of water-management policies in the years 2000–2020 to their simulated counterparts, and find a better fit for simulated scenarios that involve lobbying than for a socially optimal one; this result prevails under simulated conditions of extreme water shortage due to faster population growth or lower recharge of natural water sources. The best-fitted political-equilibrium scenarios indicate considerable deadweight loss. We discuss potential causes of over- and undervaluation of the lobbying effect.

N2  - Research Summary: We argue firms implementing political activities face a fundamental trade-off between the content and the speed of public officials' decisions. Firms can use their political capital to speed up public officials' decisions at the expense of less customized content, or to push for more tailored content at the expense of speed. How do firms respond to this trade-off? We argue firms' nonmarket strategies are determined by their market environment: they will push for content or speed depending upon the level of competitive pressures they face in the market. In the presence of high market pressures, firms are more likely to push for speed; whereas firms facing low market pressures are more likely to push for customized content. Managerial Summary: We show evidence of a trade-off between content and speed in the political arena looking at Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals: lobbying for broader drugs leads to longer revisions, whereas lobbying to speed up the review process leads to narrower drugs. We explore how firms respond to this trade-off in a sample of 540 new drug applications to the FDA from 1998 to 2015. We show firms' lobbying strategies depend upon the level of intellectual property (IP) protection behind their drugs: firms with high levels of IP protection are more likely to lobby for drug scope, whereas firms with low levels of IP protection are more likely to lobby for revision speed.

N2  - Is it possible to bridge the gap between the state's secrecy and the people who are ruled? Social and Political Bonds argues that mediation between people and purposes, parts and wholes, voluntariness and coercion, not only can but must occur in a fair society and outlines a range of strategies that can be used to join seemingly irreconcilable social and political contexts. Warning specifically against official moralistic rhetoric, the ignoring of civic demands, and hidden acts of power by anonymous governmental bureaucracies and lobbyists, F.M. Barnard uses an approach that blurs the boundaries of specialized fields of study in order to recognize the degree to which individual choice influences political force. He also shows how any attempt to achieve a balance between the state and society requires a developed political judgment and a measured view of what can be politically attained and demanded. A masterfully clear work that synthesizes centuries of political theory, Social and Political Bonds makes a powerful and well-reasoned case for the benefits of civic involvement and governmental cooperation. © McGill-Queen's University Press 2010.

N2  - Forest policy implementation is a political endeavor involving both state and non-state actors. We observe that civil society organizations (CSOs) often federate into civil society-led coalitions (CSCs) in order to shape forest policies in their favor. They appear to be successful in doing this during the policy design phase but we know little about whether they are able to see through to implementation the changes they have put in motion. Analyzing CSC strategies during policy implementation could help to explain variation in the extent to which forest policies are successfully implemented. This paper analyzes the strategy choices and potential impact during policy implementation of a loose CSC comprised of CSOs, activists, people's movements, researchers, and lawyers that advocates for the full implementation of the Forest Rights Act in India. Drawing from the Advocacy Coalition Framework's focus on belief systems, complemented by insights from political ecology and civil society/social movements literature, we develop a framework to analyze CSC strategy choices. Our analysis is conducted at the national level and in two states, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. We employ qualitative research methods, including 38 interviews with CSC and non-CSC members, and a comprehensive analysis of the main CSC listsery and 1000 relevant English language newspaper articles. Our study reveals that the CSC employs a range of conflictive and collaborative strategies in its attempts to influence state-led implementation processes, at both national and state levels. It draws on a loose, heterogeneous network with ability to connect internally and a clear moral justification of its involvement in FRA implementation. However the diverse range of views on the implementation issues held by CSC members, lack of dedicated funding for coordination, limited legitimacy in the eyes of some state actors and a constricting wider institutional setting, impedes the CSC's ability to make coalition-level strategy decisions. Our results lead us to argue that CSCs are undoubtedly active in forest policy implementation at the national level and in the two states analyzed, though limited coordination of strategies potentially restricts their impact on the policy implementation process.

N2  - Historians and contemporaries alike have criticized Chilean public administration during the Parliamentary period due to the emergence of clientelism in the selection of public workers. Notwithstanding, a great part of these impressions are not based on evidence. This article analyzes the development of administrative careers in public services between 1884 and 1920, specifically studying the hiring and promotion processes. It concludes that, despite the nonexistence of a bureaucratic framework for career management, in practice there was a de facto civil service system which permitted long administrative careers within public administration.

N2  - Most lobbying is invisible, meaning that interest groups routinely contact government officials “off the public record.” While such lobbying is ubiquitous, whether and how it may affect public policy decision-making remains largely unknown. I theorize that lobbying that employs both invisible and visible tactics is the most influential. I study the development of 38 health-related regulatory policies in Wisconsin to assess this argument. I employ government records, survey data from more than 350 individuals, and interviews with 15 state policymakers. I find that invisible and visible lobbying—when performed in combination—are associated with greater regulatory policy change. From a normative perspective, these results are both reassuring and troubling. On one hand, the results suggest that invisible lobbying, on its own, rarely drives state regulatory policy shifts. Yet, on the other hand, those interested parties with the resources necessary to lobby across multiple modes are more likely to see policy change.

N2  - Established in 1949 in the face of Fianna Fail hostility, and greeted
with suspicion by both the department of Industry and Commerce and the
department of Finance, the Industrial Development Authority within ten
years had carved out a powerful position for itself within the
bureaucracy. By the early 1950s, while Sean Lemass was still wedded to
the concept of import-substituting industrialisation, the I.D.A. was
formulating its vision for `industrialisation by invitation' and
lobbying internally for the introduction of export profits tax relief
The adoption of this measure in 1956 initiated the low corporation-tax
regime that remains in place to this day. Though frequently conflated,
the reorientation of industrial policy in the 1950s and the dismantling
of tariff barriers in the 1960s were quite separate initiatives. That
the establishment of the I.D.A. and the adoption of export profits tax
relief were opposed by the department of Finance and enacted by
inter-party governments clearly distinguishes them from the later
trade-liberalisation initiative associated with the partnership of T.K
Whitaker and Lemass. The present paper explores the circumstances
surrounding the establishment of the I.D.A. and traces its evolution and
expanding influence over the first ten years of its existence.

N2  - In this article, we reflect upon the backgrounds and career trajectories of judicial officers currently presiding over the Federal Court and Supreme Courts, which are some of the highest courts, in Australia. We gathered information through publicly available websites in Australia providing official biographical information, and drew on academic efforts to fill in more details about the judiciary. While patchy, the picture today in the Australian judiciary is of a relatively uniform educational and career background - for both male and female judges. Our analysis shows that judges are predominantly recruited from a long career at the private Bar. However, given continued professional barriers to women succeeding in the Australian legal profession which we describe, we argue that it is time to take seriously the stated goals of modern judicial appointment to widen the pool and consider merit that is not solely defined by a benchmark male career.

The Bracero program was the largest temporary "guest worker" labor program in US history. This study examines the motives underlying the House and Senate vote on the final extension of the vote on the Bracero Program in 1963 and the current House vote on the Mexican farm labor policy in 1996. It tests whether legislators respond to the rent-seeking behavior of competing special interest groups. The actual testimony on the Bracero program is used to identify some of the competing special interest groups and to develop a prohibit model of the vote.

N2  - The article presents the methodology used in building a panel of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the National Policy for the Integrative Health of the Black Population (PNSIPN). The methodology was developed in four stages: scenario identification, implementation context, PNSIPN indicators and validation of the indicators. The proponents of the policy, street-level bureaucrats, technical advisors of the collegiate representing the managers, representatives of social movements, of associations and forums of pathologies participated in every stage. Those actors identified and agreed on the panel's indicators, which have been categorized into indicators of coping with racism; indicators of sociodemographic conditions according to gender, age and race/color; and indicators of morbidity and mortality according to gender, age and race/color. The indicator panel for monitoring and evaluating the PNSIPN implementation is feasible and can be used at municipal, state and federal levels, possibly subsidizing the implementation process and enabling the improvement of management. The methodology contributes to the identification of indicators for public policies aimed at guaranteeing human rights, rights surveillance and advocacy.

N2  - Does the quality of the local bureaucracy reduce the failures in the implementation of resources of federal transfers to municipalities? This paper analyzes the process of policy implementation that makes use of federal funds, with a focus on irregularities identified in the implementation. Data from the ``Programa de Sorteios Publicos{''} of the General Controller Office, with a random sample of Brazilian municipalities (2003-2004), are used as a measure of the quality of implementation. As the main explanatory factor four measures of quality of bureaucracy are analyzed: inadequacy, the quantitative, the qualification and absence of politicization. Using negative binomial models, the results indicate that the greater the inadequacy of the bureaucracy, the grater the number of implementation failures and irregularities in the administration of federal transfers and the greater the number of employees per capita and the proportion of employees with higher education, the lower the number of failures and irregularities in the implementation of federal funds. These results indicate the importance of the quality of the bureaucracy to explain the implementation of decentralized policies.

N2  - The connections between Irish politicians and the private sector are the subject of constant speculation, particularly in the post Celtic Tiger period. However, there is little systematic evidence whether publicised cases of such ties represent the exception to the rule, or if they are symptomatic of a larger problem. In this paper we focus on one aspect of the public–private nexus and investigate whether a revolving door–the movement of individuals between public and private sectors–exists in Ireland. Using evidence from originally collected data on former TDs from 1989 to 2016, we find that almost one third of ex-politicians are in the private sector; however, many merely return to their previous occupations as solicitors or small business owners. Still, 11 per cent turn to consulting, lobbying or corporate board membership. We find that former cabinet ministers, the representatives of FF, PD and FG parties, as well as TDs who do not run and lose are more likely to join the corporate sector. We additionally compare former TDs with ex-officials in the civil service. Finally, placing Ireland in a comparative context, we find that the extent of the revolving door problem here is lower than in other democracies.

N2  - This paper offers a historical overview of the first century of hydropower in the US from today’s perspective of the water/energy nexus. Hydropower emerged as a technology in the 1880s and its development expanded until large dam building ended in the US in the 1970s-1980s. I summarize the century from the two different angles of the water sector and the electric power sector, as the roles and strategic importance of hydropower changed dramatically in the two sectors, in the parallel histories of water development and electric power development. The paper emphasizes the electricity side of the hydropower story because the water and environmental aspects are more widely known. During the first 50 years, hydropower dams were far more important to the electric power sector than they were to the water sector. Dams were juicy economic prizes that were fought over by private and public power utilities, politicians and government officials, and other interest groups, and that were built into the core of regional power grids during their foundational decades. Control of hydropower symbolized the deeper political and economic conflicts between public and private interests in the power sector, with hydropower becoming strongly identified with public power. In both sectors, there was a major turning point in the 1930s because of the growth and intervention of the Federal government in the New Deal. The earlier trends reversed and over the next 50 years hydropower became essential in the water sector - scaling up rapidly as the critical factor in paying for Federal multi-purpose water projects - and secondary in the power sector (with regional exceptions). In the power sector, hydropower’s trajectory after the 1930s was paradoxical. It boomed in absolute terms, quadrupling in generating capacity as Federal agencies built hundreds of large dams, but hydropower’s relative importance in the power sector declined steadily as the rest of the sector grew even faster. The half-century of hydropower’s greatest expansion ended by its taking a smaller role in the overall power grid. Over the long run, the dynamics of the energy sector have dominated the water sector, a lesson that may apply to other examples of the water/energy nexus in the US and abroad. © 2021 by the Natural Resources Journal Cover design by Ashley Baca.

N2  - Against a background of institutional change and organizational reform, we analyze the politicization of the European Commission's bureaucracy. Politicization can generally be defined as the substitution of bureaucratic neutrality by introducing political considerations into the human resource management and behaviour of civil servants. The concepts of direct and professional politicization serve as vantage points for our analysis. The empirical data are taken from documentary analysis and recent online and semi-structured surveys of Commission officials. We show that Commission bureaucrats, although they are highly sensitive to the political side of their job, are less politicized since the Kinnock reforms than before. While the College of the Commission seems to have indeed become more politically responsive to its supranational peers and national governments, the Commission's bureaucracy can be characterized as weakly politicized or, according to current debates, as quite instrumental in a Neo-Weberian sense.

N2  - Policy decisions are greatly affected by the way issues are understood collectively by policy-makers and the public. Naturally, advocates attempt to affect these dynamics by drawing attention to one dimension or another. Lobbyists outside government, such as political leaders and civil servants within governing institutions, try to spin or frame the issues on which they work. Research on framing is difficult, however, because of a methodological complication: no individual actor single-handedly determines how issues are defined collectively. The collective dynamics of agenda-setting and framing are subject to strong competitive forces, maintaining a stable equilibrium at most times, but also to threshold effects that can occasionally lead to rapid shifts in issue definitions. Research strategies used to study one face of framing (at the individual level) are ill suited to study the second face of framing (aggregate shifts in collective issue definitions). We discuss the two faces of framing as they relate to recent literature on policy-making in the European Union and we suggest some avenues for future research.

N2  - The complexities of multi-level advocacy within the EU create a number of challenges and opportunities for research. Here I focus on three issues: Advocacy, venues, and framing. Scholars investigating lobbying in the EU have made great strides and are now fully integrated into an international community of scholarship, more so than in previous decades. Being clear about the wide range of actors, including government officials, who may play the role of advocates, understanding the complexities of the various venues of policy-making within the EU, and studying framing processes systematically are important challenges as the literature continues to move forward.

N2  - In the 1990s, social movements against large dams in India were celebrated for crafting a powerful challenge to dominant policies of development. These grounded struggles were acclaimed for their critique of capitalist industrialization and their advocacy for an alternative model of socially just and ecologically sustainable development. Twenty years later, as large dams continue to be built, their critics have shifted the battle off the streets to new arenas - to courts and government committees, in particular - and switched to a techno-managerial discourse of maintaining river health. What accounts for this change? This article traces the trajectory of cultural politics around Indian rivers within the larger imagination of the nation, the rise of economic liberalization and Hindu nationalism, and the emergence of environmental bureaucracies. It argues that, alongside being shaped by this context, current anti-dam campaigns also contend with the legacy of earlier social movements, their gains as well as losses. This political field has narrowed the potential for radical critique, large-scale collective mobilization and, ultimately, keeping rivers alive.

N2  - Administrative styles are informal routines and standard operating procedures that characterise the behaviour and activities of public administrations in the policy-making process. They can be understood as the meso level of organisational culture. The ‘first generation’ of administrative styles can be considered a continuation of the policy styles and regulatory styles research tradition. As such they have been mostly employed to describe state-society relationships. Recently, a ‘second generation’ of administrative styles scholarship has emerged, which broadens the scope of the concept to also account for politico-administrative interactions and bureaucratic influence potentials. Administrative styles are guided by two orientations, namely positional and functional orientations. Depending on the prevalence of positional and functional orientations in behavioural patterns, it is possible to distinguish four ideal-typical administrative styles that apply to administrative routines of influencing policy-making processes and outputs: a servant style, an advocacy style, a consolidator style, and an entrepreneurial style. Variation in administrative styles across different organisations can be explained by the internal and external challenges organisations perceive. Understood this way, administrative styles could enable comparative assessments of bureaucratic routines and influence in policy-making across different countries or sectors as well as in sub-, supra-, and international bureaucracies. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Michael Howlett and Jale Tosun; individual chapters, the contributors.

N2  - This article examines the forms of state planning associated with neoliberalism, through a history and ethnography of the Kolkata Port Trust during liberalization. All state plans are promised futures which create a contested dialogue between bureaucrats and citizens. Neoliberal governance makes these interactions particularly ambiguous and opaque, because it relies on decentralized, speculative planning and the stimulation of public-private partnerships. These produce diverse, behind-the-scenes negotiations whose outcome is entirely different from the schemes initially outlined in textual state promises. It also places low-level bureaucrats in a liminal, Janus-faced role, in which they act both to create and to cross a boundary between public and private action. This new mode of rule is particularly problematic in settings such as the Hooghly River, where informality dominates in labor relationships. Bureaucrats deploy practices previously associated with "corruption" and patronage in order to enfold networks of unprotected labor into the revenue streams and plans of the state.

N2  - As a new regime emerges from a revolution, new political elites must define arrangements framing the functioning and composition of the state bureaucracy. Iran's 1979 revolution is no exception. While Pahlavi-era public officials were initially maintained in their posts, bureaucratic structures were ultimately dismantled and civil servants - including diplomats - were ousted. As of November 1979, changing power balances among revolutionary elites triggered profound diplomatic purges. International isolation, exogenous pressures and lasting conflict with Iraq threatened the new regime's durability. The Islamic Republic's new diplomatic apparatus thus needed to articulate three fundamental and interconnected imperatives: diplomats must be loyal, they must be skilled and their social characteristics must echo revolutionary expectations. Pahlavi diplomats were first replaced by young and politicised revolutionary militants, who were promoted through clerical elites' patronage, and often lacked diplomatic expertise. This very shortage of both diplomatic competencies and university credentials, combined with the absence of formalised recruitment processes, eventually challenged long-term regime consolidation. This paper examines how institutional instruments, set up to conduct the recruitment and training of the Islamic Republic's new diplomatic elite, were fashioned into existence and reformed over time. More precisely, it highlights the intricate articulation between, on the one hand, new diplomats' socio-political properties and the nature of their relations to political elites and, on the other hand, distinct sources of regime legitimation oriented towards the Iranian population and foreign diplomats. Relying on archival work, interviews, as well as data and network analyses, this work demonstrates how diplomats' recruitment and training institutions, striking a balance between specific forms of loyalty, expertise and representativeness, ensured stable political-administrative arrangements over time. It further highlights how the Islamic Republic's institutional duality regulates diverging elite agendas and interests, in that it facilitates a division of diplomatic labour between (1) the promotion of diplomatic overture and (2) the sustainment of a '.revolutionary' external agenda. © 2022 Brill Nijhoff.

N2  - Discussion of politico-administrative relations as well as the research on agencies generally treats the “politicisation” of agency management as a single, “black-box” concept, according to which agency managements (and other senior civil servants) are either political or not. Our paper shows that, using a strict, but widely applied defi nition of what constitutes a political appointment, agency heads in Slovakia are overwhelmingly “political”, but that the implications of politicisation vary, depending on the type of politicisation. In particular, we distinguish personal nominations of the responsible minister and contrast them with party nominations based on coalition agreements. Based on a series of interviews with senior policy-makers on both sides of the politico-administrative divide, we show that the selection mechanism, incentive structure and robustness of actual accountability mechanisms differs more between these two types of politicisations than between the ministerial and formally “non-political” appointment. © 2012, Versita.

N2  - This article analyses the role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the corporate governance of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including a case study of a central-level SOE holding group. Relying on official documents, secondary literature and interviews with enterprise managers, government officials and academics, the article documents how the CCP has actively formalized its role in Chinese business by embedding itself in the corporate governance structure of SOEs. Through the application of Chinese indigenous administrative corporate governance concepts such as "bidirectional entry, cross appointment"and "three majors, one big,"the CCP has consolidated its dominance of enterprise decision-making procedures and personnel appointment and created a hybrid, Party-led model of corporate governance. While this hybrid model can secure enterprise compliance, communication with higher state and Party organs, as well as long-term development planning, it is unlikely to help solve SOE efficiency problems and may even undermine other SOE reforms.

- type of bureaucrat (street-level)
N2  - This paper draws on research into the role of Independent Reviewing Officers (IROs) in England, exploring the dimensions and challenges of their `independence'. IROs are specialist social workers whose function is to review the cases of children in public care and ensure that they have appropriate plans and that these plans are being implemented in a timely manner. IROs are `independent' in the sense that they are not the social worker to whom a child's case is allocated, and do not have line management responsibility for the case, however they are employed by the same local authority. There are detailed regulations and government guidelines on their role, and high expectations, but what does independence mean in this context? The paper draws on a mixed methods study conducted by the authors in 2012-14, which included a survey of 122 files of children in care from four local authorities; interviews with 54 social workers, 54 IROs, 15 parents, and 15 young people; six focus groups; and nationally-distributed questionnaires for IROs (65), social work managers (46) and children's guardians (39). The study found five dimensions of independence: professional, operational, perceived, institutional and effective. The IROs and social workers generally took more nuanced and pragmatic approaches to their inter-professional working than prescribed in the policy guidance or the pronouncements of politicians and judges, seeing this as more likely to be effective. IROs are not, and cannot be, the solution to all the problems that exist in services for children in care, and the other professionals involved should not be seen as necessarily any less capable or committed to the best interests of the children. Rather, the IRO is part of an interactive system of checks and balances which, together, may increase the likelihood that professional judgement will be exercised effectively on the child's behalf.

N2  - In today's White House, implementing elaborate lobbying campaigns in support of the president's legislative initiatives is a familiar exercise. However, even as tales of presidential arm-twisting and deal making abound, still unclear are the general strategies by which presidents can build winning coalitions on Capitol Hill. Here I propose that presidents have available two basic options for influencing Congress: they can shift the distribution of preferences for roll-call votes, and they can censor the policy alternatives that make it that far. The first constitutes a vote-centered strategy, the second an agenda-centered strategy. After developing each within a framework that explains presidents choices of lobbying targets and tactics, hypotheses are tested against corresponding data on the interactions between administration officials and U.S. Senators for three important issues in the 107th Congress. © 2008 Southern Political Science Association.

N2  - Presidents' positive role in US lawmaking is as ubiquitous as it is unclear. While a rich literature has identified many macro-level factors that constrain presidents' policymaking potential, still unanswered is Richard Neustadt's micro-level question: how can presidents influence legislation given the context and Congress they happen to inherit? Developing a game theoretic model in which the president allocates scarce 'political capital' to induce changes in legislators' behavior, we deduce two lobbying strategies that White House officials may execute and, in turn, examine their impact on the laws that result. Comparative statics analysis not only shows how presidents can best target their persuasive arsenal, but further specifies the factors that condition those efforts' effectiveness. Interestingly, results show that standard roll-call-based tests likely underestimate presidents' legislative impact. We thus conclude by reconsidering the practice and potential of presidential leadership in national policymaking.

N2  - Innovations in military ranks are uncommon. An exception has been the evolution of warrant officer grades in the United States armed forces. Viewed as enlisted personnel for much of their history, warrant officers have moved ever closer to the roles and status of commissioned officers. The steps in this process have included the appointment of enlisted personnel to warrant officer grades to meet service needs rather than to provide individual rewards, the creation of a longer warrant officer career ladder, the conferral of commissions on warrant officers, the application of more stringent standards for warrant officers, the enhancement of warrant officer training and education, the provision of a rite of passage from enlisted to officer status, and the acknowledgement of the potential or actual command duties of warrant officers.

N2  - Frameworks that examine policy subsystems, networks, and coalitions view bureaucracies as part of the mix of policy actors that advocate policy positions in both domestic and international arenas. However, few examine bureaucracies as independent actors and how they exercise influence distinct from other pressure groups. The ways in which domestic bureaucracies engage in the international environment is woefully under examined, with only a few studies examining how domestic bureaucrats affect decision making in the international arena. However, it is not unreasonable to posit that bureaucratic engagement in the international arena may have political implications in the domestic sphere. Building on examinations of bureaucratic autonomy, this research queries the ways in which domestic bureaucracies can interact in the international arena to "change agendas and preferences" of domestic political actors. While it finds that attention to developing an international reputation can enhance political leverage at home, it may do so at a cost to domestic programs if insufficient attention is given to domestic aspects of the organization's mission. Nevertheless, as attention lurches from one arena to another, policy change is facilitated by the politically powerful resources of an international reputation in expertise, active engagement in the international policy community, and broadly based support for programmatic change.

N2  - This article documents the formation of a powerful political network stretching from the central bureaucracy to the provinces under the aegis of the Kiipriilii household, the most influential vizierial household in the seventeenth-century Ottoman Empire. Starting with the appointment of Kiipriilii Mehmed Pasha as a grand vizier in 1656, the members of the Kiipriilii household occupied in the years that followed the most important positions in the Ottoman administrative and military system. Thanks to their long-lasting incumbency, the Kiipriilii grand viziers managed to establish the most efficient political network in the Ottoman state during the seventeenth century. By exploring the roles of the kethudas, agas and scribes in the Kiipriilii household and by examining those of its clients and family members in the military and administrative system, this article sheds light on the transformation of the recruitment system and patronage patterns in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth century.

N2  - Missing from most studies of congressional staff is the insight gained from the representative bureaucracy literature that descriptive characteristics may affect the behavior of unelected bureaucrats. In considering congressional representation as an activity mediated by staff, we ask: Does descriptive representation of congressional committee staff lead to substantive representation? We explore this question, using gender as our descriptive characteristic of interest. We produce a typology of staff roles developed through in-depth interviews about two cases that illustrate how institutional factors affect and constrain women staffers' contributions as substantive representatives for issues concerning women. We posit that passive representation translates into the active representation only when: 1) interest groups hold expectations for passive representation on an issue and then in turn demand some level of active representation; 2) a staff member possesses the necessary resources of interest, expertise, and status, and 3) the opportunity structure of member-staff relations, staff autonomy, and political salience coincide. When these conditions are less than optimal, active representation will not occur.

N2  - The Digital Future Coalition (1996-2002) was an unprecedented public interest coalition on internet and copyright policy with much farther-ranging effects than has been recognized previously. Uniting commercial and noncommercial stakeholders to push back against intellectual property maximalism on the nascent internet, it altered both treaty and legislative language, entered a trope (“balance”) into national discourse on copyright policy, blocked US copyright protection for databases, enhanced popular engagement with fair use, and set the stage for the Right to Repair movement. This historical research was accomplished primarily by interviewing representatives of the Digital Future Coalition (DFC) and opposing groups, as well as one ex-official, and by consulting a hitherto-untapped private archive of documents relevant to the prehistory and 1996-2002 history of the DFC.

N2  - Although substantial advances have been made in our comprehension of functional politicization - political capacities and activities being taken on by bureaucrats in their administrative duties - questions surrounding its causal mechanisms remain. To shed light on these questions, we here explore increasing political polarization (and fragmentation) in Dutch politics and functional politicization over the period 2007-2019 to see how the two are related. To do so, we adopt a cross-time approach that observes which skills - political-strategic insight, substantive expertise (Fachwissen), or procedural knowledge (Dienstwissen) - senior civil servants perceive to be the most relevant to successfully and correctly exercise their profession in a period of increasing polarization in the Dutch political landscape. Drawing from surveys conducted with senior civil servants in 2007, 2013 and 2019, combined with semi-structured interviews conducted in 2019, the data depicts the prevalence of political astuteness in the profession and highlights the factors for its causes: institutional, organizational, and interpersonal dynamics. This indicates an (in)direct link between political polarization and functional politicization of the administrative apparatus that serves as a basis for further cross-time and cross-country investigation.

N2  - In recent years the extent of mismanagement and corruption in postconflict countries has been identified as a serious challenge to the efficiency and effectiveness of peacebuilding programmes. Perhaps more worryingly, sometimes the cure has been more damaging than the disease. Judicial prosecution has rarely resulted in visible and lasting results, mostly because of low capacity and corruption in the judiciary - typical of postconflict states. Likewise, the establishment of anti-corruption agencies, probably the most common executive anti-corruption approach in peacebuilding contexts, has obtained only meagre results (see John Heilbrunn’s contribution to this volume). In Afghanistan, Kosovo and Sierra Leone, not a single ‘big fish’ has been convicted by an anti-corruption agency. In some extreme cases, anti-corruption agencies are nothing more than another layer of corrupt bureaucracy (de Sousa 2009). It is in this context that policy makers and analysts have turned to civil society hoping to deal more effectively with fighting corruption than current executive-driven strategies (Bolongaita 2005: 13). This chapter acknowledges that civil society can play a positive role in anti-corruption activities, in particular by monitoring the behaviour of public authorities in the unstable and corruption-ridden transition from war towards peace and democracy, and also in providing a ‘voice’ to citizens’ demands for accountability and change. However, the relationship between civil society and corruption is not limited to the former fighting the latter. Civil society organisations in post-conflict states commonly incorporate and reflect the broader political and institutional context in which they operate. Where such a context is dominated by patronage, clientelism and corruption, as is regularly the case in post-conflict settings, civic associations also tend to replicate those vertical bonds. Thus, as this chapter will argue, civil society plays a dual role. At its best, civil society organisations are at the forefront of anti-corruption activities. Media reports of both civil society work and intimidation against whistleblowers confirm how the determination of individuals and groups is essential to exposing corrupt activities. At the same time, many civil society organisations are part of a broader network of patron-client relationships.

N2  - The interest in and enthusiasm for shifting food systems to community-based and local trajectories have increased exponentially over the past decade. Part of the appeal of community-based, local food systems is their potential to secure access to healthy food for local communities, expand sustainable farming practices, promote local food economies, and advance environmental and food justice. Interactions and collaborations within the spectrum of the food system's stakeholders-from farmers to local officials and organizations to local businesses and residents-are the cornerstone for effective food systems tailored to their community's needs. An increasing number of food system studies have applied stakeholder assessment approaches to map out complex situations among multiple stakeholder groups with different values and viewpoints regarding food system change. However, despite being an essential and influential political unit to target, counties have received very little attention in food system studies, as researchers and practitioners often focus on the federal and state levels of intervention to design food policies. This study examined the food system in Will County, Illinois, by applying the advocacy coalition framework and using a qualitative, semi-structured survey to engage a diverse set of stakeholders. The answers to the survey questions offered insights into three overlapping and divergent Will County stakeholder viewpoints (Pragmatic, Environmental and Food Justice Advocate, and Visionary), with the intent of informing and enacting food system transformation at the county level. The discussion within this paper focuses on coalition-building and collaboration between formal and informal groups to empower local communities to develop a distinctive food system identity that promotes community support, collaborative networks, and food justice at the county level.

N2  - This article publishes two petitions to the prefect of Egypt by a gymnasiarch of Oxyrhynchus named Quintus Marinus Claudianus, the son of a veteran. They were written on the respective sides of the same papyrus. The front carries a draft petition concerning appointments to municipal magistracies. On the back was copied another petition concerning the financing of spectacles by magistrates for a local festival, together with the official response. These texts provide an interesting window on some of the challenges facing civic magistracies in the towns of Roman Egypt in the late second century CE and state authorities' responses to them, as well as new evidence for related imperial constitutions. They also present us with the son of a veteran who held an unusually high status compared to most veterans and their descendants in Roman Egypt. An appendix considers the remote possibility that the second petition was addressed to the emperor Septimius Severas when he visited Egypt at the turn of the third century and revisits the chronology of his sojourn in the province.

N2  - Social policy scholarship assumes that left-wing governments favour a stronger public provision of services, while right-wing politics promote privatization, largely as a matter of ideology. Yet the findings on Canadian provinces’ market-based housing instruments suggest that alternative views are possible. Left-leaning governments introduced private delivery mechanisms for economic as well as non-economic reasons. The archival research and thematic analysis of interview responses with key actors (n = 56) suggest that the introduction of housing allowances in the policy toolbox largely results from bureaucratic initiatives, regardless of the party in power. Rather than political forces or advocacy by power interests, this policy change is mostly driven by considerations of equity and efficiency on the part of officials ‘muddling through’. The concept is revisited in the final discussion, where important strands of the privatization literature are challenged, as well as the political assumptions associated with the notion of users’ freedom. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - The paper analyses the development of the activities of non-governmental organisations of the disabled in the context of social integration. Social Integration Act (2013) emphasizes that during the implementation of social integration ideas, it is important to ensure equal rights and opportunities of the disabled in the society, to establish the principles of their social integration, to define social integration system and its prerequisites as well as the authorities implementing the social integration of people with disabilities. The NGO concept of social integration of people with disabilities in Lithuania is described presenting a variety of social integration concepts assumed by scientists, theorists and practitioners. Hereby is presented an empiric investigation, which purpose was to reveal the approach and experience of respondents towards the development of the NGOs activities. The findings of a qualitative research performed by the author of the article revealed that disabled people expected the most social services from the NGOs. The independence of disabled people is pursued by social services. Educational peculiarities are also characteristic to the activities of NGOs. The research findings demonstrated that the disabled, who joined NGOs, expressed their need for training and developing their self-expression. Analysing the experiences of respondents, it became clear that the need for material help was important to disabled people. The research showed that usually NGOs represented a group of disabled people. The more disabled people were represented, the more they integrated to the society itself. Talking about the forms of representation, the participants of the research emphasised that the representatives of authorities transferred to NGOs to solve the problems of disabled people. This demonstrated the trust in NGOs by people, who form a particular social policy, and the people, who implement it, whereas such organisations were more able to solve the problems of disabled people than state institutions. Applying qualitative research methods, the research helped to reveal the difficulties arising from the administration of NGOs and people forming and implementing the social policy representing the interests of disabled people. Difficulties limiting the social integration of disabled people were established: the bureaucracy of the representatives of the state authorities in respect of NGOs, the lack of public awareness of disabled people, too strict requirements of disabled people to the representatives of the authorities, and the transfer of conflicts to disabled people. These difficulties showed the lack of dialogue by all participants. The participants of the research actualised the factors, which were oriented towards the changes of the development of NGOs' activities, pursuing the social integration of disabled people. The representation of interests oriented towards the activeness of disabled people in the NGOs gaining the influence on the resolutions of authorities, the ability of disabled people to cooperate in NGOs pursuing the high quality representation of their interests, financial support for a person representing and solving personal problems, the representation of interests oriented towards decision-making by the members of NGOs, closer relationships with the representatives of the authorities, efficient organisation of the NGOs' activities, and NGOs as a measure to overcome the social exclusion of disabled people were listed as the important endeavours of NGOs. Hence, an NGO is a social overcoming tool, which encourages higher involvement into society through the participation of disabled people in the activities of NGOs.

N2  - Despite international mobilization for greater humanitarian mine action and despite considerable clearance achievements, the majority of mine-affected communities have not yet been involved in formal clearance activities. They adapt to the contamination largely by local means. The differing degree to which local adaptation is successful is now better understood as a result of the Global Landmine Survey, a multi-country survey project launched in the wake of the 1997 Ottawa treaty to ban anti-personnel mines. Socio-economic impact surveys have since been completed in several countries. In addition to landmines, the Global Landmine Survey records impacts also from unexploded ordnance (UXO). The ability to avoid mine incidents is used to measure adaptation success. We use a variant of Poisson regression models in order to identify community and contamination correlates of the number of recent landmine victims. We estimate separate models using data from the Yemen, Chad and Thailand surveys. We interpret them in a common framework that includes variables from three domains: Pressure on resources, intensity of past conflict and communities' institutional endowments. Statistically significant associations occur in all three domains and in all the three countries studied. Physical correlates are the most strongly associated, pointing to a lasting deadly legacy of violent conflict, but also significant learning effects over time are present. Despite different measurements of institutional endowments, in each country one factor signifying greater local development is correlated with reductions in victims, whereas factors commonly associated with the presence of government officials do not contribute to local capacity to diminish the landmine problem. Strong spatial effects are manifest in clusters of communities with recent victims. Two policy consequences emerge. Firstly, given humanitarian funding limits, trade-offs between clearing contaminated land and creating alternative employment away from that land need to be studied more deeply; the Global Landmine Survey will need to reach out to other bodies of knowledge in development. Secondly, communities with similar contamination types and levels often form local clusters that are smaller than the administrative districts of the government and encourage tailored planning approaches for mine action. These call for novel coalitions that bring advocacy and grassroots NGOs together with local governments, agricultural and forestry departments and professional mine clearance and awareness education agencies.

N2  - Along with the trend toward New Public Management (NPM) and replacing the legal culture of public bureaucracies with market logic through privatization, we are also witnessing instances of publicization, the application of public law norms and mechanisms to privatized services. The article explores the role of government lawyers and economists in the dynamics of these administrative reforms. Using a detailed case study of welfare-to-work reform in Israel, it shows that the reconstruction of decision making and accountability patterns under NPM was the result of competing efforts by these professional groups to appropriate the privatized state to accord with their own institutional logics and interests. While economists advanced a market logic, lawyers tried to reproduce the logic of law in the post-bureaucratic setting. The study demonstrates how eventually public law norms were re-infused into privatized welfare as a result of the increasing institutional power of the lawyers in the regulatory space, along with wider political and social support for the entrenched legalistic mechanisms of the administrative state. However, in addition to the battle of norms between lawyers and economists, there were also concessions that led to the redrawing of the boundaries of public law along more functional, rather than formal, lines.

This emergence can be explained by the existence of a metropolitan transportation authority (MTA), by the labeling of a bus riders union (BRU) as the legal official representative for transit users, and by the way transit projects are financed - requiring a two third majority of the voters of the entire metropolitan area. However, this public debate is being blurred by several factors. Firstly, community participation at a more local scale, as in particular by home owners associations, appear to have a much bigger say and lobbying power in the way transit policies are shaped and implemented. Secondly, transit service restructuring - though the privatization and the municipalization of bus service and through the decentralization of MTA whose administration is now split into different sectors - leads to an institutional fragmentation, whose maybe desired consequence is the disempowerment of the Bus Riders Union to negotiate with a centralized body over transit policies.

N2  - The vast majority of research on interest groups tends to focus on the state and national levels (Baumgartner et al. 2009; Bergan 2009; Kollman 1998, Leech et al. 2005). Recent scholarship has shifted to the local level, for good reason: there are a large number of cities that have organized interests and Political Action Committees (Anzia 2019a; Berry 2005; Reckhow 2009). Additionally, the local political context varies from state and national contexts in two key ways: many of these elections take place off-cycle, and many are nonpartisan (Anzia 2014; Davidson and Fraga 1988 https://doi.org/10.1177/106591298804100210; Hajnal and Trounstine 2005). Using data from an exit poll conducted during the 2017 municipal election in Durham, NC, I consider whether voters in Durham knew which Political Action Committees (PACs) endorsed which candidates and whether knowing the endorsements of candidates is associated with their support for those candidates. I explore when local PACs engage in activities that mirror state and national interest groups. In these nonpartisan contexts, PACs borrow from the playbook of political parties during election season by giving endorsements and sending mailers to their members. Outside of election season, they borrow from the playbook of interest groups by lobbying local elected officials.

N2  - This article proposes a narrative of city contestations beyond policy and programs. It considers why Indian metro elites, large land developers and international donors paradoxically lobby for comprehensive planning when confronting `vote bank politics' by the poor. Poor groups, claiming public services and safeguarding territorial claims, open up political spaces that appropriate institutions and fuel an economy that builds complex alliances. Such spaces, here termed `occupancy urbanism', are materialized by land shaped into multiple de-facto tenures deeply embedded in lower bureaucracy. While engaging the state, these locality politics remain autonomous of it. Such a narrative views city terrains as being constituted by multiple political spaces inscribed by complex local histories. This politics is substantial and poses multiple crises for global capital. Locally embedded institutions subvert high-end infrastructure and mega projects. `Occupancy urbanism' helps poor groups appropriate real estate surpluses via reconstituted land tenure to fuel small businesses whose commodities jeopardize branded chains. Finally, it poses a political consciousness that refuses to be disciplined by NGOs and well-meaning progressive activists and the rhetoric of `participatory planning'. This is also a politics that rejects `developmentalism' where `poverty' is ghettoized via programs for `basic needs' allowing the elite `globally competitive economic development'.

N2  - The transformation of land into a setting for clustering local economies can become an important cornerstone of poverty policy. This transformation has several functional aspects, which in turn have important institutional and political aspects. Underlying both the functional and institutional factors is the role of local government and local democracy. Such a conceptualization puts to center stage several paradoxes: A terrain that seems ``slum-like'' turns out to be highly productive and employment generating. Complex tenure forms and mixed land use seen as ``unplanned'' turn out to be pre-requisites for economic development. There are institutional paradoxes that contrast efforts at ``transparency'' and managerial ``best practices''. Here, the messiness of local bureaucracies in municipal government turns out to be critical for poor groups to influence interventions in their favor. Influencing the public process may be more effective in stealth-like ways rather taking a more visible approach. Most fundamentally these issues remind us that the potential of cities to reinforce or reduce poverty moved far beyond projects and programs and the normative frameworks used by planners and administrators. Instead, it is the transformative process of turning land into economic settings that might be at the center stage. This is a stage where poor groups are the central actors who stealth-like draw on complex alliances across ethnic and class lines to shapes cities in their interests.

N2  - We study how interest group lobbying of the bureaucracy affects policy outcomes and how it changes the legislature's willingness to delegate decision-making authority to the bureaucracy. We extend the standard model of delegation to account for interest group influence during the implementation stage of policy. We analyze how the decision to delegate changes when the bureaucratic agent is subject to external influence. The optimal degree of delegation as well as the extent to which interest groups influence policy outcomes differ depending on whether the system of government is characterized by unified or divided control. The result is a comparative theory of bureaucratic lobbying.

N2  - For the most part, privacy and data protection laws arose not through
grassroots pressure but through interactions between governmental and
business elites in the context of broader international harmonization
efforts. Thus, civil society activists have rarely been seen as a client
constituency with equivalent weight to governmental and business
interests. There is evidence, however, that the privacy advocacy network
is becoming more influential in comparative context. In most countries,
a network of advocates has emerged with a relatively distinct profile
from the ``official{''} data protection authorities. Individual
advocates play several conflicting roles and often exist within groups
with wider civil liberties, human rights, digital rights, or consumer
interests. Those at the center of the privacy advocacy network possess a
set of core beliefs about the importance of privacy, and as one passes
to the outer edges the issue becomes more and more peripheral. Privacy
advocacy is beginning to occur from both the inside, and the outside,
representing an important shift in the evolution of privacy protection
policy both nationally and internationally, and producing difficult
tensions between the two networks.

N2  - Introduction. Since the inception of emergency medical services (EMS), individuals have assumed the role of ``training officer{''} without a clear and concise description of the responsibilities inherent in this position. Furthermore, EMS system leaders rely heavily on these individuals to implement changes within an EMS system and to ensure the competency of practicing out-of-hospital professionals. The limited understanding of and research in training officer roles highlight the need for study in this area. Objectives. Specific objectives of our study were to describe demographic and work-life characteristics of training officers, estimate the number of hours spent on specific training officer tasks in a typical week, and determine methods of training officer appointment and education received after appointment. Methods. This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional census analysis of all training officers in the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) database. This questionnaire contained items related to demographics, work-life characteristics, and specific roles and responsibilities of training officers. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized to assess specific differences among training officers. Results. Over 2,500 individuals responded to this questionnaire (2,528/4,956). The majority of the respondents were male (79.0\%), held a full-time salaried position (64.9\%), and were of nonminority status (93.4\%). Individuals reported an overall median number of years worked in EMS of 19.0 (standard deviation {[}SD] = 8.7, range = 0-45) and a median of 4.0 years of serving as a training officer (SD = 5.1, range = 0-33), and planned to serve as a training officer for a median of 10.0 years (SD = 7.6, range = 0-50). The highest median numbers of hours spent on specific training officer tasks in a typical week were for providing patient care (median = 8.0, SD = 18.1); developing, delivering, and accounting for continuing education (median = 5.0, SD = 9.8); department administration (median = 5.0, SD = 12.8); and performing run reviews (median = 3.0, SD = 6.4). Conclusion. The role of the training officer in ensuring the continued competence of the EMS professional has not been delineated in this paper, and future efforts should seek to answer this research question.

N2  - This article compares the role of brokers in mediating access to public services in India and Indonesia. Brokered state-citizen interaction is generally considered to be detrimental to democratic accountability and governance. Yet recent studies are emphasizing that brokers can also be empowering. Reconciling these contrasting assessments, I argue in this paper that the character of brokerage networks shapes the capacity of citizens to hold their politicians and bureaucrats to account. Employing over two years of ethnographic fieldwork in both India and Indonesia, I develop a comparative framework that compares brokerage networks in terms of their degree of fragmentation, institutionalization and levelling. In Indonesia the versatile and more state-centered nature of brokers networks plays into the hands of incumbents, while the fragmented and more levelled nature of India's brokerage networks strengthens democratic accountability. I use this comparison to advance the argument that the evolution of brokerage networks constitutes an important, yet little-noticed dimension of democratization processes. When citizens gain access to public services through networks that are fragmented, institutionalized and less marked by social hierarchies, politicians and bureaucrats face stronger pressures to perform.

N2  - Political fixers are intermediaries who use political contacts and knowledge of official procedures to help citizens, particularly the poor, deal with state institutions. Variously referred to as dalaals, pyraveerkars or, more denigratingly, as chamchas or taporis, these brokers have acquired a key role in the flow of information and resources between state institutions and India’s citizens, and have accordingly been described as ‘lubricants’ or ‘enablers’ of India’s democracy (Reddy and Haragopal 1985; Manor 2000). While the often-lucrative nature of their work attracts derogatory comments about the selfishness of the ‘services’ (seva) which they provide, political fixers are generally indispensable for both citizens and power holders. They channel the demands of citizens to alien and often unresponsive state institutions and supply government officials with the information necessary to implement policies and uphold regulation. They also help politicians to trade access to state resources for electoral support. Such brokers are central to many post-colonial democracies, but it has been argued that they play a more prominent role in India than anywhere else (Manor 2000, 817). Given the centrality of political fixers to the everyday functioning of India’s democracy, there are surprisingly few studies devoted solely to them. They make regular appearances in writings on other subjects, like the literature on India’s political parties, which highlights how in India’s ‘patronage democracy’ brokers help politicians convert state resources into electoral support. They also appear in writings on governance and service delivery, which show how networks of politicians and political fixers interfere with state policies (Mooij 1999; Veron et al. 2003; Baud and de Wit 2008). © Cambridge University Press 2014.

Exclusion criteria: local level (a single region)
N2  - This article develops an explanation for why democratisation processes sometimes fail to foster effective civil service reform. Using ethnographic fieldwork on the evolving relationship between civil servants and politicians in Lampung, a rural backwater in the southern tip in Sumatra, this paper attributes the ineffectiveness of bureaucratic reform measures in Indonesia to the way in which elections trigger competition over control over state resources. I argue that a merit-based bureaucracy is particularly difficult to institute when a local bureaucracy enjoys strong discretionary control over the distribution of state resources. During Suharto's authoritarian regime, this control rested largely in the hands of bureaucrats. This authoritarian legacy generates strong incentives for politicians to prefer loyal bureaucrats over capable ones. Politicians need to use bureaucratic appointments as a means to obtain campaign support and to develop control over state resources. In developing these arguments, this paper offers an approach to incorporate informal and clientelistic dimensions of politics more explicitly into analyses of processes of bureaucratic reform.

N2  - Does restructuring security forces reduce the risk of civil war recurrence? Prior research has examined effects of military integration in alleviating commitment problems, but the evidence has been inconclusive. Other aspects of civil-military relations have received less attention. This article examines the effects of civil-military relations in the context of postwar struggles to consolidate authority. It outlines three pathways through which security forces contribute to renewed civil war: by excluding rival factions and facilitating insurgent mobilization, by exploiting control over resources to challenge the regime, or by escalating incipient insurgency through repression. Analysis of original, cross-national data on postwar civil-military relations shows that reducing the potential for exclusion and exploitation through diverse officer appointments and robust civilian oversight lowers the risk of civil war. These findings emphasize the distributive effects of restructuring security forces and highlight the value of examining political contests around state institutions to understand why civil wars restart.

N2  - Slow and complicated wind power planning and permitting procedures have been a large obstacle for wind power diffusion in Sweden and other countries. This paper complements previous siting-oriented literature with a planning perspective on these problems. The focus is two national planning instruments implemented in Sweden in the early 2000s: a national planning target and an appointment of areas of national interest for wind power. The paper identifies different types of conflicts of interest related to wind power - in addition to the conflict between wind power as a national public interest and various local private interests - and analyses the impact of the national planning instruments on the handling of these conflicts in the land-use planning process in the County of Östergötland. The analysis shows that the planning target actually made local planning officials even more inclined to treat wind power as a private rather than a public interest and that the method used to identify areas of national interest of wind power forced wind power to compete with the combined strengths of all other public interest. The planning instruments thus left wind power to fight an uphill battle rather than to meet other interests face-to-face on a level playing field.

It also identifies leading practices and frontiers in HRM practice and research. Technical HRM expertise in development exists in matching organizational performance with staffing, advancing decentralization, international project management, and training, and research also shows extensive concerns with patronage and anti-corruption. Frontiers are discussed in connection with strategic HRM, notably improved leadership development/talent management, workforce engagement in developing settings, re-thinking/professionalization of appointee-executive relations, comprehensive HRM strategies, and increased leadership for HRM itself. Although development studies often raise HRM implications, relatively few focus on HRM in development in a comprehensive fashion. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Effective democratic governance rests on the executive’s ability to forge coalitions that can advance policy and sustain the government against challengers. Scholars have long focused on cabinet appointments to understand how executives build coalitions with their legislative allies. In many democracies, however, cabinet appointments at the ministerial level may only represent the tip of the iceberg. We show that administrative political appointees (APAs) beneath the ministerial level constitute one of the most important ways that cooperation between legislative and executive is forged. Leveraging a unique and comprehensive database of an average 2600 Brazilian APAs per year over two decades, we evaluate their effect on coalition unity in critical legislative votes. We demonstrate that these APAs, which we collectively term the “patronage coalition,” have a significant effect on legislative support and thus are a critical tool for presidents. Our results are particularly relevant to a new emphasis in the political science literature on the “toolbox” that presidents utilize to address the challenges of simultaneously maintaining legislative support while implementing policy. These results demonstrate that the patronage coalition is a fundamental tool that should be more widely integrated into models of legislative-executive bargaining. © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - The politicization of the European Union has elicited a variety of views on the European polity. Public scepticism is often directed at the European Commission which is accused of being an unresponsive and illegitimate bureaucracy. How does politicization affect the institutional role conceptions of Commission officials? By building on the literature of politicization and norm-guided open system approaches, I develop theoretical propositions on how politicization may affect the institutional role conceptions of Commission officials. Grounded on the proposition that Commission officials are most likely to respond to politicization in their home country, an exploratory case study of Dutch officials (21 in-depth interviews) was performed to flesh out the mechanisms at play. The findings tentatively reveal that, in varying degrees, most officials respond to politicization by adapting their institutional role conception into a more pragmatic direction, in which subsidiarity or legitimacy concerns are central.

Exclusion criteria: local government
N2  - Local governments invest in public infrastructure to develop their regions. When they depend on intergovernmental grants for local development and have opportunities to lobby upper-level governments for such grants, horizontal intergovernmental competition in lobbying activity may emerge in addition to competition over public infrastructure. This paper empirically examines the existence of these interactions between Japanese localities, by using data on the value of industrial parks as infrastructure provisions and on personnel interchanges between the central and local governments as a measure of lobbying activity. Our results suggest that a Japanese local government's choice of the size of industrial parks and its invitation to central officers to act as a director on loan are positive responses to the neighboring local government's policy choices. As the value of the industrial parks in a district is affected by the neighboring districts' lobby activities and their industrial park values, we can interpret these results as evidence of inter-regional competition in these two dimensions, rather than control by the central government in this unitary state.

This ethnic nationalism was inspired by the advances of the Afrikaans language movement and the formation of the National Party (NP) in 1914 as a political home to many Afrikaners. An objective with the establishment of Sanlam as a life assurance company was the economic empowerment of Afrikaners in South Africa. Economic upliftment was the goal. From the beginning, the company was known principally as an Afrikaans institution focusing on Afrikaner interests. Sanlam wanted to establish itself as a South African establishment rendering a service to the entire South African community. That vision made business sense - a successful enterprise in the South African market that also contributed to Afrikaner empowerment. The question is whether that focus resulted in the company relying on an exclusive Afrikaansspeaking NP supporter base in its staff composition. This question is raised especially in view of Sanlam's Afrikaans slogan at that time: ``Uit die volk gebore om die volk te dien{''}. The interpretation of the meaning of the word ``volk{''} is contrasting. Afrikaners of that period understood the word as referring to the Afrikaner people. ``Volk{''} is translated into English as ``people{''} or ``nation{''}. The slogan therefore reads as follows in English: ``Born from the people to serve the people{''} implying a wider involvement than only the Afrikaners. Pronouncements of Afrikaner politicians contributed to this confusion of tongues. The Afrikaner leader JBM Hertzog, for instance, on the one hand considered the concept ``Afrikaners{''} to include Afrikaans and English speakers. On the other hand, he maintained that the two groups perhaps will be united somewhere in the future. Sanlam leaders' views in this regard varied between a reference to the ``Afrikaans-speaking section{''} of the ``Afrikanervolk{''} and a statement that the company is a truly Afrikaans national institution in the broadest interpretation of the word. Another reference in this regard is the view that Sanlam had developed from service to the section of the population from which it originated and that the staff members are in the service of the Afrikanervolk. Regardless of all the rhetoric, business sense played the determining role eventually. The company indeed saw the light of day with three non-Afrikaners as staff members in its midst. Two Scotsmen occupied senior positions in the new company and a Jewish woman assisted the personnel in the correct use of business Afrikaans. During the establishment years, a number of English-speakers were appointed. However, the staff overwhelmingly remained Afrikaans-speaking. Despite or perhaps as a result of the disparate interpretation of the company slogan, non-Afrikaners were involved in the company from the beginning as well as a senior Afrikaans staff member who openly exhibited his support for a party other than the NP. Although a minority by far, they were accepted as normal staff members. From the preceding analysis it turns out that the Sanlam slogan retrospectively can be rephrased as ``Mainly, but not completely born from the Afrikaner people to serve the South African nation{''}.

N2  - This article examines to what extent European interest associations combine public political strategies with traditional forms of inside lobbying or the seeking of access to public officials. I compare two theoretical perspectives: a resource-based explanation focusing on the nature of the mobilized interest and an institutional account emphasizing the explanatory power of varying institutional conditions. My data show that institutional variables have a significant effect on whether and how, public and inside strategies are combined. Although the institutional supply of access favours specific interests, the European Union contains important institutional opportunities for diffuse interests that aim to expand the scope of political conflict or signal policy concerns by using public political strategies.

N2  - The degree to which interest groups gain access to policymakers has often been explained by focusing on the exchange of resources in a dyadic relation between interest groups and policymakers. This article argues that the position an interest group occupies within a coalition and the relations it has outside its coalition substantially affect the likelihood of gaining access to policymakers. Our empirical focus is on the Dutch interest group system for which we examine how coalitions among groups and the network position of interest groups within and between such coalitions shape access. The analysis, based on data collected among 107 Dutch interest groups and 28 policymakers, leads to the conclusion that network positions count differently for elected and non-elected officials, and that network ties that bridge different coalitions add significant explanatory leverage to resource-based explanations of access. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

N2  - Often it is argued that the EU depoliticizes political issues as bureaucrats and nonmajoritarian institutions are key in the policy-making process. However, recent research rejects this perspective and shows that domestic political cleavages organize the European political space. This article demonstrates that (a) political cleavages affect the organization of policy networks among Euro-level bureaucrats, politicians, and societal interests; and (b) that the institutional organization of government facilitates the emergence of advocacy coalitions mobilizing these political cleavages. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the European political space is dominated by a cleavage between a progrowth coalition and a sustainability coalition. Furthermore, it shows that political officials occupy a pivotal position enabling them to mediate between these two coalitions. Finally, data on the actors' resource reputations suggest that in granting access, public officials attach considerable value to the public support coalitions enjoy.

N2  - The 1970s are an important period for our understanding of the contemporary phenomenon of state reform. During that period, three dynamics contributed to the notion of the administration as a "public problem". The press increasingly decried bureaucracy, devoting page after page to the only remedy for it, administrative reform. This made for a publicising and "socialising" of administrative matters, previously shaped only by internal issues of the state apparatus. During the same period, the administration also became a subject of political importance, at the core of a two-sided electoral competition with rightand left-wing programmes. Inherent in this politicisation was the demand for greater control of the administration by elected representatives. Then, New Public Management and its neo-liberal recipes began making their way to top-level administration and feeding into various reform positions, as testified to by the writings of high-level civil servants published in the 1970s. These partially independent but nonetheless interwoven elements continued to shape and naturalise "state reform", the critical attention paid to the functioning and arcane complexities of administrative machinery.

N2  - Research has shown that interest organizations seeking influence on
public decision making pay increasing attention to parliamentary actors.
No distinction has, however, been made between attempts to affect
law-making directly and attempts to gain influence on other
parliamentary activities such as agenda setting and control of
bureaucracy. Drawing on data about organizational approaches to the
Danish parliament, this article demonstrates that interest organizations
influence strategies in relation to different parliamentary activities
show dissimilar patterns. Strategies in regard to law-making fluctuate
with the strength of parliament vis-a-vis the government, while
strategies concerned with more general parliamentary activities depend
more on the level of these activities and secondarily on increases in
parliamentary resources. The analysis thus confirms that organizations
react to changes in the political role of parliament, but takes the
understanding of this a step further by emphasizing that changes in
direct parliamentary influence on law-making and in more general
parliamentary activities affect different aspects of organizations'
influence strategies.

N2  - Public bureaucracies are increasingly characterized by employee diversity in terms of ethnicity. Investigating relations between ethnic groups in bureaucracies is therefore important. This article focuses on the particularly interesting case of the Greenlandic administration. Being a former Danish colony, Greenland still recruits bureaucrats from mainland Denmark. These work alongside locally hired employees resulting in an administration with different ethnicities, cultures and languages. The analysis of ethnic relations is based on 28 interviews with bureaucrats of Danish and Greenlandic origin. Even though overall relations are found to be largely harmonious, ethnicity makes a difference. Interviewees describe differences in ethnic traits and behaviour and processes of social categorization. Particularly among Greenlanders, Danes are described as dominant and this dominance is reinforced by co-variation between ethnicity, language skills and education. Finally, inter-group relations are found to vary with the numerical balance of ethnic groups in different parts of the bureaucracy.

N2  - Interest group research has focused extensively on political access. While access does not guarantee influence, it is customarily seen as a crucial step towards gaining political influence. It is argued that groups with access are, all else equal, more likely to be influential than groups without access. Biased access may thus result in biased influence. On the basis of a review of this literature, the article shows how the concept of access rests on an intuitive understanding rather than an explicit definition. This hampers methodological discussions of measurement. We propose to define access as instances where a group has entered a political arena (parliament, administration, or media) passing a threshold controlled by relevant gatekeepers (politicians, civil servants, or journalists). On the basis of this discussion, we compare operationalisations based on our proposed definition with some of the major alternatives found in the literature.

N2  - Drawing on claims about the supposed powers wielded by the King of Great
Britain at the time of the Framing, proponents of the ``unitary
executive{''} theory of the presidency have long contended that the
powers to remove and direct all executive-branch officials are inherent
components of the ``executive Power{''} vested in the President by
Article II of the Constitution. These claims have had a powerful impact
on judges and scholars attempting to discern the limits of Congress's
ability to shield special prosecutors and the heads of independent
agencies from removal and other forms of presidential control.
As this Article shows, however, the unitarians' claims about the
original meaning of the executive power are largely unfounded. The
ability to remove executive officials was not one of the prerogative
powers of the British Crown. Moreover, the King neither appointed nor
was able to remove all of his principal officers, many of whom held
their offices for life or pursuant to other forms of tenure and who
operated independent of the King's direction or control. While the King
possessed plenary authority to choose his high-level advisors and the
officers who carried out his prerogatives over the military and foreign
affairs, Parliament frequently regulated the appointment,
qualifications, and tenure of other executive officials in Great
Britain, including by protecting them from removal by the King or his
ministers when there was good reason to do so.
The evidence surveyed in this Article has important implications for
debates over the unitary executive theory in general and for debates
over the constitutionality of independent agencies and officers in the
United States in particular. It suggests that the Constitution does not
proscribe efforts by Congress to insulate regulatory and law enforcement
officials from political interference in appropriate instances.

N2  - This chapter investigates whether public appointments in Denmark really are as untainted by party politics as its reputation suggests. The evidence presented indicates that meritbased appointments are indeed a large part of the story. It is not the only one, however. In fact, the results indicate that a fairly sharp line can be drawn between the civil service on the one hand, and executing institutions and auxiliary institutions, such as councils and committees, on the other. In the former, the minister's role is circumscribed and influence appears to be exercised on professional rather than political terms. In the latter, some sectors present a more blurry picture, as political motives blend with professional criteria without replacing them. Moreover, it is notable that politics is most evident in appointments to auxiliary institutions. Finally, potential historical and institutional explanations for the existing balance between parties and the state in Denmark are discussed. © Petr Kopeckỳ, the estate of Petr Mair, and Maria Spirova 2012.

N2  - In the struggle to control the federal bureaucracy, presidents have an overlooked but powerful tool: the recess appointment. By making recess appointments, presidents can fill vacancies without the advice and consent of the Senate. The authors delineate three conditions that define presidential unilateral powers and demonstrate how recess appointments fit within that paradigm. Presidents, the authors argue, should be more likely to make recess appointments to important policy-making positions, namely, major independent agencies. The authors compile a data set of every civilian nomination and recess appointment between 1987 and 2004. After controlling for other factors, the authors find strong support for their theory.

N2  - Opium poppy cultivation and drug trafficking have become significant factors in Afghanistan's fragile political and economic order over the last 25 years. In 2005, Afghanistan remained the source of 87% of the world's illicit opium, in spite of ongoing efforts by the Afghan government, the United States, and their international partners to combat poppy cultivation and drug trafficking. U.N. officials estimate that in-country illicit profits from the 2005 opium poppy crop were equivalent in value to 50% of the country's legitimate GDP, sustaining fears that Afghanistan's economic recovery continues to be underwritten by drug profits. Across Afghanistan, regional militia commanders, criminal organizations, and corrupt government officials have exploited opium production and drug trafficking as reliable sources of revenue and patronage, which has perpetuated the threat these groups pose to the country's fragile internal security and the legitimacy of its embryonic democratic government. The trafficking of Afghan drugs also appears to provide financial and logistical support to a range of extremist groups that continue to operate in and around Afghanistan, including remnants of the Taliban regime and some Al Qaeda operatives. Although coalition forces may be less frequently relying on figures involved with narcotics for intelligence and security support, many observers have warned that drug related corruption among appointed and newly elected Afghan officials may create new political obstacles to further progress. The initial failure of U.S. and international counternarcotics efforts to disrupt the Afghan opium trade or sever its links to warlordism and corruption after the fall of the Taliban led some observers to warn that without redoubled multilateral action, Afghanistan would succumb to a state of lawlessness and reemerge as a sanctuary for terrorists. Following his election in late 2004, Afghan president Hamid Karzai identified counternarcotics as the top priority for his administration and since has stated his belief that -the fight against drugs is the fight for Afghanistan. In 2005, U.S. and Afghan officials implemented a new strategy to provide viable economic alternatives to poppy cultivation and to disrupt corruption and narco-terrorist linkages. According to a U.N. survey, these new initiatives contributed to a 21% decrease in the amount of opium poppy cultivation across Afghanistan in the 2004-2005 growing season. However, better weather and higher crop yields ensured that overall opium output remained nearly static at 4,100 metric tons. Survey results and official opinions suggest output may rise again in 2006. In addition to describing the structure and development of the Afghan narcotics trade, this report provides current statistical information, profiles the trade's various participants, explores alleged narco-terrorist linkages, and reviews U.S. and international policy responses since late 2001. The report also considers current policy debates regarding the role of the U.S. military in counternarcotics operations, opium poppy eradication, alternative livelihood development, and funding issues for Congress.

N2  - There is general agreement that mass political parties emerged during the Jacksonian era, but there is no consensus about their precise origins. Institutional theorists within political science contend that political parties trace their beginnings to elite who nurtured them within the civil service bureaucracy, whereas theorists in political science who rely on microlevel explanations consider that parties developed to solve problems of social choice and collective action. Historians, in contrast, indicate that newspaper patronage in Washington, DC, beginning with Jefferson, was critical for the emergence of federal political parties. This study systematically examines the empirical implications of that assumption and considers both the organizational and political processes that underlie establishment of newspapers in the Capital, contributing to the understanding that newspapers provided a model both for the civil service and for political parties.

N2  - Mafias develop in failing states. Such states often continue failing because of the very presence of mafias and their collusion with politicians and civil servants. This happened in western Sicily in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with the development of a modern market economy that was left without protection and created a demand for alternative protection. Men skilled in the use of violence and loosely organized in autonomous, informal, local groups, called mafias, enforced alternative, nonstate ("criminal") protection. Following the abolition of feudalism and the confiscation of church domains, vast landed estates (latifundia) came up for sale. The reforms increased the number of absentee landlords and widened the gaps between them and the peasants left without compensation for the lost user rights on the estates. Mafiosi operated as powerbrokers between absentee landlords and a growing peasant proletariat. The expansion of the suffrage in the twentieth century reinforced existing power relations based on patronage. Once more, a democratic innovation favored mafia structures, organized as political machines to gather votes and keeping at bay a barely controlled class war. Mafia presence was particularly strong in western Sicily: in and around Palermo and in its vast and desolate hinterland of large cereal-pasture holdings and isolated agro-towns on hilltops that separated the peasants from the land. The near absence of mafia in the eastern part of Sicily coincides with a less colonial and a less "feudal" past, resulting in a more equal distribution of land, more intensive and diversified cultivation patterns, an advanced infrastructure, and more democratic institutions, similar to areas in the northern parts of Italy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Oral history materials from the South Wales Miners' Library are used to examine the communal understandings of, and collective responses to, the scourge of Miners' Lung (pneumoconiosis) in the 1920s and 1930s. Lay epidemiology in mining communities attributed an aetiological role to coaldust at a time when many experts believed miners' pulmonary disease to be bronchitic, or to be silica-induced. In their efforts to secure compensation claims for their members, union officials instrumentally used scientific expertise in a variety of forms: they contributed to epidemiological evidence; they lobbied for more government-funded research; they `bought' experts; they duped expert witnesses; and they made sophisticated instrumental appeals to the supposed independence of favourable expert judgements. Eventually, miners' situated `local knowledge' became scientific orthodoxy, a success story which may be associated with the class-conscious miners' `bump of irreverence' about expert knowledge, and with the divided character of the expert core-set, sections of which were receptive to miners' `local knowledge' claims.

N2  - The subject. The article is devoted to conflictology as one of the most relevant, almost significant, debatable problems in law theory, legal sciences, political science, philosophy, psychology and economics. The author analyzes specific examples of conflicts of interest in various corruption spheres and manifestations, for example, in the sphere of participation of economic actors in the procurement announced by state and municipal authorities. The methodology. The author uses comparisons of common and private, cause and effect, patterns and randomness, content and form, essence and phenomenon, the transition of quantity into quality, as well as the methods of sociology and psychology. The main results, scope of application. The article analyzes the relationship between corruption and nepotism. The article discusses legal and moral ways to prevent conflict, the role of ethical standards in conflict prevention, regulatory framework for preventing and settling them, the ratio of conflict of interest and employee qualifications, balance of material and personal interest, Commissions to prevent conflicts of interest, guaranteeing the role of writing notice of a conflict of interest, Features of the notification procedure, moral means of preventing and resolve conflicts of interest. Exclusively legal methods are insufficient to prevent and eliminate conflicts of interest and corruption-related risks. A combination of legal and moral measures is necessary, and most importantly, the exclusion of kinship and other forms of nepotism in the formation of government bodies and the appointment of officials, the hiring of state and municipal employees. It is necessary to exclude formalism from the institution of competitive selection of civil servants. Conclusions. The elimination of the contradictions between some federal anti-corruption laws has much less effect on the state of corruption in the state than the flourishing nepotism. The exercise of official functions takes place in the form of law enforcement: if there is no application of the law - there is no corruption. The main emphasis should be directed to the process of forming the apparatus of state and municipal authorities, employees of state and municipal institutions, primarily in the educational sphere, on which the upbringing of new generations of employees depends, the steady observance of high professional and moral requirements imposed on state and municipal employees and teachers in schools and universities.

N2  - This article tests the theory of advocates who celebrate the potential of civil society to promote and deepen democracy in Africa, by examining whether the human rights ministry of a Catholic parish in Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya was able to consolidate democracy through a civic education programme during 2002-5. It concludes, from an analysis of the social, economic and political environment in Kibera, that parishioners who participated in the programme demonstrated an observable improvement in their democratic values and behaviour at a localised level within their own parish groups. However, civic education did not stimulate most participants to increase their involvement in advocacy and lobbying efforts to hold government officials to account for their abuse of power in Kibera. Parishioners were inhibited from promoting their rights primarily due to fears of violent retaliation by local government officials and politically sponsored youth wingers. Other factors such as apathy, ethnic divisions, limited resources and restrictive church protocols further curtailed parishioners' actions.

N2  - The intellectual efforts made by the World Bank and its off-spring, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), to become international facilitators of investments in global environmental protection and sustainable development in the energy sector are outlined with reference to the Framework Convention on Climate Change and its troubled Kyoto Protocol. These efforts are interpreted as part of a search for markets by Northern money and expertise. Highly paid professionals trained in a small number of. universities are the immediate beneficiaries of actions to be taken against the emission of specified gases into the atmosphere. Under pressure from environmental lobbies, the Bank and GEF employ a growing number of these environmental experts. Their rationale is threefold: belief in dangerous anthropogenic `global warming',(1) calculation of monetary `global environmental benefit', and identification of this benefit with the `cost-effective decarbonisation' of energy supplies. Without this rationale, transfers of knowledge-intensive technology, capacity building and new forms of governance would forfeit legitimacy as well as many immediate professional gains. Evidence is provided to demonstrate this and it is argued that these efforts support bureaucracies in efforts to develop a global plan for `ecological modernisation', or `sustainable development' that will primarily benefit the North.

N2  - We provide the first comprehensive study of lobbying across venues by studying interest group registrations in both the legislative and administrative branches. We present four major findings based on Federal and state data. Firstly, groups engage in substantial administrative lobbying relative to legislative lobbying. Secondly, the vast majority of groups lobby the legislature, but a large proportion of groups also lobby the bureaucracy. Thirdly, representational biases in legislative lobbying are replicated across venues: business groups dominate administrative lobbying at least as much as they do legislative lobbying. Finally, the level of interest group activity in one venue for a given policy area is strongly related to its level in the other venue. The findings potentially have important implications for the impact of institutional design on both the form and promotion of broad participation in policy-making as well as the ultimate content of policies chosen by democratic governments, broadly construed.

N2  - The aim of the article is to review the audit as a form of control of the State Financial Inspection of Ukraine and to analyse its forms and types. The subject of the study is the audit as a form of control of the State Financial Inspection of Ukraine. Research methodology. The research is based on the use of general scientific and special-scientific methods and techniques of scientific knowledge. The dialectical method made it possible to investigate the definition of the audit as a form of control of the State Financial Inspection of Ukraine and the procedure for its appointment. The comparative legal method was used in order to compare doctrinal approaches to this issue. Interpretation of the content of normative legal acts of domestic legislation was carried out with the help of the normative-dogmatic method. These acts regulate the problem of appointment and conduction of the audit. The system-structural method was used for the study of the audit institution as a whole (system) with the coordinated functioning of all its elements. Methods of analysis and synthesis helped to study some parts of this institute to formulate further conclusions about its most optimal functioning. Practical impact. The analysis of types of audits, as well as their characteristic features, helped to develop recommendations for improving the procedure for conducting audits by the State Financial Inspection of Ukraine, as well as to identify problematic issues that require further consideration and research. Correlation/originality. In the research, there was made a proposal about audits, which are carried out by the State Financial Inspection of Ukraine and its territorial bodies. The proposal was to make them a form of forecasting control. It was recommended to qualify the fact of prevention the officials of the controlling body from carrying out the audit, checking or not providing the necessary documents for audit and verification as an administrative offense. A special attention was paid to the timeliness of the selection of explanations from the involved persons during the detection of offenses.

N2  - Does civil society lobbying affect states' policies on climate change? Does it facilitate or hamper cooperation towards 'greener' policies? Environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) and business lobbying groups alike are increasingly seeking to access states' negotiation delegations at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in order to affect or even change official delegates' policies. Previous studies have failed to control for the fact that the set of states that have granted civil society access to their delegations is unlikely to be a random sample. Moreover, the fact that a delegation's policy outputs may converge with the preferences of a civil society group cannot be taken as evidence that it was caused by civil society lobbying. A matching approach that addresses both problems is proposed, which corrects for the non-random assignment of civil society organizations to state delegations and forms quasi-experimental contrasts by sampling a set of 'most similar' cases that only differ in their treatment; i.e. civil society lobbying. This approach facilitates a causal interpretation of lobbying efforts. The results indicate that only business groups are likely to exert a causal influence on states' climate delegations. However, contrary to expectations, these groups appear to have enhanced states' efforts towards environmentally friendly policies.Policy relevanceWhat impact can non-governmental actors have in influencing states' policies at the climate change negotiations? This question is addressed empirically using a matching approach, which corrects potential challenges in the research on interest group influence. It is shown that business groups are likely to influence states' policies at the UNFCCC - unlike green interest groups or civil society in general. In light of these findings, three policy implications are derived that might be of importance for states and non-governmental decision makers alike. Most importantly, ENGOs should refocus their efforts for exerting their influence. ENGOs could make their lobbying more effective by first identifying the states that may be more receptive to their preferences and positions.

N2  - Although there is a substantial amount of research that studies how environmental interest groups/non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) influence international environmental negotiations, both the theoretical work and the empirical evidence were not yet able to answer comprehensively if this makes it more likely that states, in turn, commit to stronger environmental agreements. This article seeks to contribute to clarifying this. First, the authors argue that a higher degree of ENGO access to official negotiations and a larger number of ENGOs actively participating during bargaining processes can facilitate outcomes of environmental negotiations. The authors then analyze quantitative data on international environmental regimes and their members' commitment levels from 1946 to 1998 and obtain robust support for their claims. However, the rationale on the introduced explanatory factors also implies that the impact of ENGO access on states' commitment levels should vary conditional on the number of ENGOs actively participating. The paper finds evidence for such an interaction, although the results go against our expectations.

N2  - This article studies how administrations seek to shape the federal
workforce through the budget process. I develop a theory of personnel
politics in which presidents balance ideological and interest group
demands in distributing human resources across the federal government. I
argue administrations advantage organizations with which they are
ideologically aligned and that agencies with higher levels of union
penetration see increased budgeted personnel levels, particularly during
Democratic presidencies. Using an original dataset of budgeted personnel
levels from fiscal years (FY) 1983-2016 and a series of regression
analyses, I find strong support for these hypotheses. I also examine the
sensitivity of presidential strategy to congressional preferences,
agency professionalization, and leadership politicization, providing
insights into how this control strategy interacts with the broader
environment. Overall, these results have implications for understanding
the political dynamics of human capital and capacity in the federal
bureaucracy, the administrative presidency, and the politics of
performance in federal agencies.

N2  - Discretion is fundamental to understanding interbranch interactions in the US separation-of-powers system. Yet, measuring discretion is challenging. The few existing measures have difficulty capturing both delegation and constraint in a consistent way over time. In this article, we propose a novel measure of executive discretion based on legislative appropriations to all agencies, weighted by spending limitations imposed by Congress in appropriations committee reports. We provide evidence for the validity of the measure, including a test of the ally principle to establish construct validity. Finally, we demonstrate the wider utility of the measure by employing it to evaluate hypotheses about how political control over the bureaucracy influences congressional policy making in the context of discretion. We show that agency design and presidential control are important factors in congressional decisions. Overall, we present a versatile measure of discretion that researchers can use to explore a variety of questions in American politics.

N2  - Article II Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives both the Senate and the President a role in the appointment of public bureaucrats. Yet, since the drafting of that constitutional passage, changes within the Senate and Executive have created new ways for officials to influence who gets appointed to the public bureaucracy. The Senate has developed intricate vetting procedures within its committees, while the Executive Branch has created new methods-such as the Schedule C designation-to facilitate the unilateral staffing of "inferior offices." To what extent do these institutional changes affect the ideological composition of appointments to the public bureaucracy? Our formal theory predicts that the investigative procedures of Senate committees allow chairs to block ideologically disparate nominations, thus compelling presidents to nominate moderates to Senate-confirmed post while placing extremists in Schedule C positions. Empirical analyses support these predictions: the probability of Senate confirmation declines with a nominee's ideological distance from the relevant committee chair and Schedule C appointees exhibit greater ideological extremism than Senate-confirmed appointees. These findings reveal how modern, institutional modifications of Article II Section 2 influence both the ideological composition of appointed federal bureaucrats and the struggle for power between branches of the U.S. federal government.

N2  - We study how frame congruence – the degree to which key policy-makers’ frames correspond to the frames of lobbyists – is distributed between different types of interest groups. We argue that two contextual factors are particularly important for whether the frames of business interests dominate those of civil society interests in the minds of European Commission officials. First, the broader the scope of the conflict, i.e., the more affected interests active in the process, the more difficult it will be to promote narrow self-regarding frames, a fact that benefits civil society interests. Second, as business dominates the media coverage of European Union legislative proposals, the more publicity the proposals receive the higher the frame congruence of business lobbyists and Commission officials. Our empirical analysis is based on 144 face-to-face interviews with Commission officials and lobbyists in relation to 55 legislative proposals that were put forward by the Commission during 2008–10.

N2  - We study the effect of politics on the distribution of intergovernmental grants. We consider a model where local government officials lobby the central government who in turn distributes grants based on the local governments' lobbying efforts. We argue that the marginal costs of lobbying increase with the geographical and 'political' distance from the central government capital. Hence, in equilibrium, grants should decrease with a jurisdiction's distance from the capital. Moreover, grants to a jurisdiction which produces spillover benefits for other jurisdictions will meet less opposition. Therefore, higher spillover benefits will imply more grants to the jurisdiction producing the spillover in equilibrium. Using data from California counties, we find support for our model.

It seeks to trace the connections between electoral politics, bureaucracy, formulation and implementation of social policies in the sphere of states. It focuses on the political construction and renovation of state schools in Bahia over two terms (1999-2002 and 2003-2006). This paper concentrates on the impact of electoral and party politics over the allocation of investments in the Secretary of Education between the municipalities of the state, and also examines the role of appointments of senior positions in the sectorial bureaucracy in the construction of public policy. The analysis relies on a multimethod strategy, which combines multivariate statistical models and traditional techniques of case studies.

Involving collaboration between NGOs and civil servants, reports make demands upon the state and seek to hold the government accountable for promises of welfare entitlements. Once written, reports are mobile technologies used to negotiate with governmental bodies, to galvanize and constitute the nonprofit sector as a coherent entity, to justify the value of NGO work, and to argue for laws enabling nonprofits in an increasingly competitive arena of social welfare provision. © 2019, University of Pennsylvania Press.

N2  - This article argues that Mexican migrants have become politicized through participation in hometown organizations. It traces the increasing organizational complexity of hometown associations (HTAs) from the state of Guerrero formed in Chicago since the late 1980s and the parallel development of Mexican government programs in response to migrants' growing economic and political strength. As migrants negotiate with government officials to take advantage of matching funds for public works in their natal villages - currently institutionalized in the Programa 3x1 para Migrantes - they become more aware of how power structures work and how to engage them to their own advantage. As a result, some migrants now participate in explicitly political activities - both in Mexico and the United States - campaigning for candidates, lobbying for migrants' rights or even seeking political office.

N2  - The analysis we propose aims at identifying those limitations of the acts of knowledge that have emerged under the pressure of bureaucracy and politicization of institutions that administer public knowledge—the school at all levels, research centers, academies, etc. It seems of first urgency to examine without prejudice some topics such as: 1) knowledge and the institutions that manage it. We note the institutionalization of the forms of the procedural unfolding of knowledge and the standardization of the narratives that express it. This fact has social consequences that are easy to identify: No knowledge (truth) is recognized unless it enters the circuit of the institutions that manage the knowledge networks and alternative narratives (to the standard ones) develop epistemologically relevant effects only when they are allocated relevant expression space (the institutional mechanisms of authoritarian imposition block any attempt at non-conforming discourse). 2) formal narratives of knowledge and their political function prove the entry of the sciences into the circuit of the economy of symbolic goods. In social practice, the mutual negotiation between the various forms of public authority and the (compliant) education systems is transparent. Public education puts into circulation metanarratives about science that have an implicit ideo-logical dimension.

N2  - This article examines to what extent human rights NGOs influence the European Union (EU)’s promotion of human rights in the post-Soviet space, and what factors explain that influence. The article hypothesises that there will be variation in the extent to which human rights NGOs influence the EU’s human rights promotion depending on a number of factors relating to how human rights NGOs gather and transmit information. To test the hypothesised explanations, a multivariate regression analysis is applied based on data retrieved through an online survey with human rights NGOs. The article finds that human rights NGOs have a moderate degree of influence on the EU’s human rights promotion in post-Soviet countries. The NGOs’ influence depends on whether they provide information timely, whether the information provided fulfils the officials’ informational needs and is based on (scientific) research, and whether the NGOs use different tactics for conveying the information to the officials.

N2  - We study political budget cycles in infrastructure spending that are conditional on bureaucratic organization. Bureaucrats can facilitate or hinder politicians' ability to engage in voter-friendly spending around elections. To test this idea, we use civil service reforms undertaken by US states in the second half of the 20th century to study political budget cycles in highway spending under civil service and patronage. We find that under patronage, highway spending is 12\% higher in election years and 9\% higher in the year before an election. By contrast, under civil service highway spending is essentially smooth over the electoral cycle. These findings provide a novel way through which civil service rules can stabilize government activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Many private equity and venture capital firms believe that few, if any, of their funds' portfolio companies engage in traditional governmental affairs activities such as lobbying or making political contributions to elected officials or candidates. Consequently, they often opt not to conduct a proper due diligence analysis on the political activity of a current or potential portfolio company target. We consistently find, however, that many companies across a range of industries do in fact engage in political activity to varying degrees, and the same attributes that make a company an attractive potential acquisition are also those that would lead a company to be politically active. Higher Security and Exchange Commission scrutiny on private funds will not only reveal compliance issues with regulatory consequences, but also raise issues for the fundraising for future funds. .

N2  - Most studies of the relationship between deputy ministers (DMs) and ministers have focused on majority governments. This paper analyses the impact of minority government on that relationship in four areas (personnel in key positions, the role of central agencies, agendas and daily relationships) on the basis of an analysis of the history of DM appointments and departures under minority governments in Canada and interviews with current DMs. It is found that, under minority governments, relationships of trust are more difficult to develop, there is a stronger tendency to develop public policy on an urgent basis and with a view to short-term issues, greater importance is attached to public opinion, and control is more centralised.

N2  - This chapter has reviewed the political processes inherent in the development of health policies and the community health nurse's policy and advocacy roles within those processes. The foundations of political action and advocacy stem from a rich history of PHNs, like Lillian Wald, who strived to provide a voice for vulnerable and disenfranchised populations. Social justice remains a pillar of our current practice. Advocacy for our clients is always important, but professional advocacy through affiliation and activity in our professional nursing organizations is also vital so that we, as PHNs, may have a "collective voice." This chapter highlighted examples of nurses who are serving as elected officials-many of whom came to power through grassroots efforts. Politics may be uncomfortable and foreign to many of us, yet it provides the methods for needed change through lobbying or influencing legislators. Nurses and special interests groups can gain access to legislators individually or through the services of a professional lobbyist or PACs. Policies are actions or agendas that can be used to implement important goals and objectives, such as the health objectives found in Healthy People 2020. Distributive, redistributive, and regulatory health policies were defined and discussed, along with the processes that can be used by PHNs to impact policy formulation, adoption, implementation, and evaluation. Tips on how to influence policy makers were outlined, and nurses may consider volunteering time to a candidate of their choice as a means of gaining greater access to the political process. Nurses' role in health care reform was discussed, along with IOM's The Future of Nursing, and lobbying efforts by the ANA. Community health nursing is by nature political because we deal with many issues that affect the health and wellbeing of the diverse populations we serve. Power and empowerment are important concepts to both public health nursing and politics, and political action and advocacy skills should be honed by every community health nurse. .

N2  - The lobbying process has been described as an auction (see, for instance, Bernheim and Whinston [4]). While the auction rules picked are supposed to be descriptive, they vary from author to author. Examples show that these different auction rules make different predictions of what policy is the outcome of the lobbying process. Further, which proposed auction rule is the most preferred by the government official depends on the preferences of lobbies. If off-the-equilibrium negative contributions (i.e., contributions from the government official to lobbies) are possible, there is a best possible auction for the government official. Such an auction leads to the same policy as in [4], although contributions are higher. If negative contributions are not possible, the government official is made worse off. It follows that since the auction rules used in the literature to describe lobbying do not allow negative contributions, none of them are optimal from the government official's perspective.

N2  - This paper seeks to situate Jewish individuals from the upper echelons of the Mongol government in Iran and Iraq (1258-1335) in relation to the process of confessional, Sunnī-Shī ī polarization. Focusing on the case of the Baghdadi Jewish physician and vizier Sad al-Dawla (d. 1291), I explore how the Jewish minister sought to take advantage of Twelver-Shī ī rise to prominence under the Mongols. I argue that the vizier attempted to strike an alliance with the Shī ī communities in Iraq and with influential Shī ī families with long-established ties to the Mongol regime, in order to curtail resistance to his policies and to the Jewish dominance in the realm's bureaucracy. I consider Sad al-Dawla's endeavors within the broader historical context of Shī ī-Jewish relations. The article concludes by examining the two decades following Sad al-Dawla's downfall, when a group of eminent Jewish physicians at the Mongol court converted to Islam. I show how these converts continued to exploit the process of politicization of confessional identities under the Mongols.

N2  - The theory of representative bureaucracy suggests that a demographically diverse public sector workforce (passive representation) will lead to policy outcomes that reflect the interests of all groups represented, including historically disadvantaged communities (active representation). Implicit in the passive-active link is the expectation that minority public administrators, in particular, will have similar attitudes to minority citizens on issues of critical import and relevance to those citizens, and those attitudes, in turn, will influence policy decisions. This research examines the attitudes of citizens and administrators on a series of survey items focused on the responsibilities of local government administrators to advocate for the interests of the African-American community. The survey results confirm the hypothesis that African-American citizens and administrators are more likely than white citizens and administrators to support governmental behaviors that specifically target the interests of the African-American community and that African-American citizens and administrators hold markedly different attitudes from white administrators. Most significantly, attitude congruence with the views of African-American citizens by administrators is shown to be a significant predictor of the adoption of an African-American representative administrative role, overwhelming the influence of other variables including race.

N2  - Although the relationship between Russian government and society in the nineteenth century is often portrayed in terms of conflict, cooperation was more typically the rule. The tsarist state encouraged, sanctioned and patronized private associations dedicated to the pursuit of national betterment and the prestige of the realm. The interests of state and society appeared to be shared interests, and on many projects monarchy and officialdom were willing to collaborate with private individuals. However, the increasing civic activism of private associations during the second half of the nineteenth century challenged the authorities' ability to control the public sphere, and the relationship between state and society turned gradually from cooperation to conflict. We may chart the trajectory from cooperation to confrontation by examining the Free Economic Society's involvement in education. Although the government bureaucracy, the zemstvos, and teachers' professional organizations have received the attention of historians, less is known about the work of Russia's science societies. The involvement of private associations in popular education during the second half of the nineteenth century demonstrates the opportunities, as well as the limitations, of nongovernmental public action. An examination of a division of the Free Economic Society known as the Literacy Committee will also provide a case study of the interaction between officialdom, an association, and the broader public as well as an example of the horizontal linkages in society that associations facilitated. The initial partnership between state and society turned into conflict, as the Literacy Committee spearheaded a rise in public activity in the 1890s. This civic activism, as well as the claim of the Literacy Committee's leaders to a voice in public policy, raised the specter of a vast archipelago of unauthorized and unscrutinized public initiative in education; conflict more and more entered into the relationship between government and society. By operating in a legally sanctioned public sphere and by mobilizing a public, the Literacy Committee, along with other education associations, the zemstvos and the city councils, were a lever used by activists in an attempt to wrest education from government tutelage. However constrained by the government, participation in nongovernmental associations gave the public a voice and allowed activists to challenge government tutelage. Using the vehicle of the association, Russian education activists framed public opinion, organized public meetings around issues of concern, and claimed an advocacy role in public policy.

N2  - Research on bureaucratic power typically focusses on rulemaking and policy implementation, while bureaucrats' participation in the legislative process remains underexplored. We theorise and test a specific mechanism by which bureaucrats attempt to sway legislative outcomes, which we term indirect bureaucratic lobbying. Using a novel survey of state-based health lobbyists in 25 states, we show that state Medicaid agency staff routinely request lobbying assistance from provider associations and consumer advocates. We also provide the first systematic evidence of the conditions under which indirect bureaucratic lobbying is likely to occur. Our results suggest that individual-level policy agreement interacts with institutional factors, most notably agency performance and gubernatorial power, to increase the likelihood that bureaucrats will use this strategy to attempt to influence legislative deliberations.

N2  - This case study of the Bromsgrove Poor Law Union provides an addition to the literature by examining the early years of a union which welcomed the New Poor Law, and asking how effective it was in implementing it. Other studies have tended to focus on areas of opposition. The union was situated in Worcestershire, on the edge of the Black Country; its nail- and needle-makers and agricultural labourers suffered significant deprivation and ill-health. In 1837, the guardians petitioned Parliament, highlighting properly managed officers, better relief for the needy, and reduced incentives for the idle, as key benefits of the new system. This study finds that, by introducing a proper appointment system, and to a lesser extent by holding officers to account, the union attracted diligent staff. The needy benefited from medical services, moderate success at containing disease, and a relatively humane workhouse, although the latter still acted as a deterrent. Efforts to keep the able-bodied working were inhibited by the system, and Bromsgrove responded pragmatically, continuing to provide out-relief after its abolition, and classifying families as sick wherever possible. Throughout, the degree to which the union sought, obtained and followed the advice and approval of the Poor Law Commission, is striking. Finally, as a new case study, this contributes to the development of a regional approach to the New Poor Law.

N2  - The purpose of the study is to show up the practice of educational, communicative and administrative training of the Byzantine political elite - the imperial ambassadors according to their historical and literary works and epistolary heritage. The methodological basis of the study constitutes the principle of historicism, which is based on the research strategy of the life stories from the first person. Scientific novelty. For the first time in Ukrainian historiography the criteria for selecting an imperial ambassador, the procedure for his appointment, the preparation of the ambassador and the other embassy staff for the diplomatic missions, their level of education, personal qualities, protocol requirements for the ambassador's behaviour, risks and dangers of diplomatic activities are studied. Conclusions. The main criterion for the appointment of the imperial ambassador in the Byzantine Empire was the trust of the emperor and a narrow circle of his advisers to the person who was entrusted to head the diplomatic mission. The ambassador was a direct representative of the byzantine emperor and had to meet certain social, educational, presentative and managerial criteria. Ambassadors were appointed not simply from the highranking officials, representatives of the Constantinople nobility and military leaders. Of great importance in choosing the candidacy of ambassador was his education level: knowledge of history, philosophy, law, public speaking, the ability to persuade and negotiate, knowledge of protocol rules of diplomatic conduct. The natural intelligence, sedateness, prudence and wisdom were also valued. In addition, the imperial ambassadors had to have an excellent reputation, experience in administrative or military management.

European Public Choice Meeting, Durham, ENGLAND, 2005
N2  - We develop a model of bureaucratic budget catching, where bureaucracies compete for resources just like fishermen. Considering taxpayers' money a free access resource in the absence of tight fiscal control (passive sponsors), bureaucratic self-interest may induce excessive lobbying behaviour even from the perspective of the bureaucrats themselves. Our contribution is to extend the original Niskanen (1971) model by suggesting that bureaucrats will expend resources on lobbying rather than provide public goods, thus rendering the bureaus more inefficient. Such decreases in public good provision affect production in society negatively in the next period, leaving fewer resources for the total group of bureaucrats. One possible empirical implication could be bureaucratic lobbying within the EU due to the institutional stronghold of the Commission. Arguably, the weak institutional position of the European Parliament probably contributed to the observable priority of public goods provision. However, rigorous empirical investigations are needed in future to verify or reject our theoretical claims.

N2  - Can civil servants in a developing democracy successfully resist political capture in the distribution of public goods? Existing research tends to highlight political patronage logics of distribution, and scholarship focuses primarily on politicians’ motivations. But service decisions are often made by bureaucrats, who sometimes explicitly try to avoid capture and allocate on the basis of need. Using qualitative interviews and spatial regressions with geo-coded data from a solar panel program in Ghana, we examine such a situation. We show that, despite considerable efforts to thwart it, national-level civil servants were unable to fully resist political capture. While solar panel distribution partially corresponded to need for electricity, we find that panels also went to areas where voter turnout was historically inconsistent, likely to motivate voter turnout. The direction of these relationships was consistent across subnational space, but the magnitudes varied considerably and were strongest in districts adjacent to Lake Volta. Qualitative data analysis reveals that this subnational variation reflects the logistics of space and the historical politics of place. The article contributes to theories of distributive politics and of voting behavior, and highlights the need for subnational disaggregation across space. © 2019

the factors influencing Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to choose
their locations within a country. Interpreting the findings from a range
of models evaluating 4,210 organizations in 70 districts, and drawing on
in-country interviews with NGO leaders and workers, government
officials, and politicians. it finds that sub-national NGO location
corresponds to an area's objective level of need, as well as the
convenience of the location for accessing beneficiaries, donors, and
elite goods. Contrary to dominant theories of African political economy,
political factors like patronage appear to have little or no significant
influence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - We show that local politicians' probability of being employed by a municipality increases when they have a strong party connection to its mayor. Using a regression discontinuity design, we compare the employment outcomes of individuals connected to the winner vis-à-vis those connected to the runner-up in close mayoral races in Ecuador. Among candidates to local councils who lose their bid, the probability of getting a job in the municipality increases tenfold when their own party's mayoral nominee is elected. The effect is very strong for low-ranking positions, which suggests that it is the result of political patronage. Three additional results shed light on where patronage is more likely to emerge. First, the effect is stronger in poorer municipalities, where public sector jobs are more valuable. Second, benefits go largely to politicians better positioned within the party structure. Third, the effect is concentrated among younger mayors, who have a longer career ahead of them to capitalize clientelist arrangements.

This paper seeks to place them in context, examining not only the state of the industries themselves in the periods before, during and after the First World War, but also the impact upon them of pressure groups, bureaucrats and academics. It suggests that what at first appears to be a freestanding piece of investigative work was in fact the product of a long evolutionary process which can only be explained in terms of agricultural policy, the internal politics of government departments and academic institutions, and long-term technical and economic change.

N2  - This article explores the nature of long-term interactions between bureaucrats and interest groups by examining two behavioral logics associated with stability in public policy making. In addition to the implicit short-term strategic choices that usually feature in resource-exchange explanations of interest group access to policy makers, this article shows that bureaucracy-interest group interactions are likely to be dictated by routine behavior and anticipating future consequences as well. By drawing on survey and face-to-face interview data of Dutch senior civil servants and interest groups, the analyses reveal that a practice of regular consultations, the need for political support, and a perceived influential position together explain why bureaucrats maintain interactions with interest groups. The combination of these behavioral logics adds important explanatory leverage to existing resource-exchange explanations and shows that organizational processes as well as long-term strategic considerations should be taken into account to fully explain bureaucracy-interest group interactions. © 2012 SAGE Publications.

N2  - Consultation of major interest groups is a widespread administrative practice in many EU member states. To date it is unclear, however, how advancing European integration influences domestic consultation practices. This article examines the impact of European integration on domestic consultation practices by conceptualizing how the underlying rationales of government-interest group interactions and the level of involvement of interest groups are affected by European integration. The study draws on original survey data on senior civil servants in Britain and the Netherlands to empirically examine these effects. European integration is related in a limited way to domestic consultation practices, both in Britain and the Netherlands. This small but significant effect is mostly observed during the process of domestic preference formulation in EU-level policy making. Our findings suggest that intra-organizational processes, for example organizational routines and task-specialization, potentially play a greater role than has thus far been appreciated in Europeanization studies.

N2  - Principal-agent models in public administration concentrate upon policy drift-when agencies allow policy to drift away from the bliss point of executive politicians. We distinguish two types of policy drift: policy shifting and agent shirking. The first occurs when agents' political bliss points are located differently from those of their principals. The second occurs when agents do not competently carry out their principals' wishes. One response to policy shift is to appoint agents who share the bliss point of the principal, allowing the reduction of costly monitoring. Through 10 cases in three Israeli cities where political appointments were made to push through structural changes to contract out services, we show that political appointees are less effective than career bureaucrats, so that solving shifting often increases shirking, especially when monitoring is reduced. The agency problems thus created were only solved by increasing monitoring and returning to career civil servants.

N2  - A fourth kind of citizens' rights-the republican rights-are being recognized and enforced in the last quarter of the twentieth century, after the civil, political, and social rights have been defined. Republican rights are the rights that every citizen has that the public patrimony, the res publica, is utilized on behalf of the public interest. While civil rights protect citizens against a powerful state, republican rights protect the state against powerful citizens involved in several forms of rent-seeking. Three major types of republican rights are identified: rights to the environment, to the historical patrimony, and to the economic patrimony. The last, in flow terms, corresponds to the state's revenues, which are permanently threatened by businessmen, bureaucrats, and all kinds of special interest groups, sometimes in subtle ways. To identify and contain these threats is a major challenge for modern institutions and law systems.

N2  - When do politicians in developing democracies prioritize meritocratic recruitment over patronage hiring for public sector jobs? I distinguish between low- and high-skilled positions and argue that the former are valuable for sustaining party machines, while manipulating the latter can undermine state performance. Accordingly, politicians will interfere to ensure their copartisans are hired to low-skilled jobs but select bureaucrats for high-skilled positions based on meritocratic criteria. I test my argument using novel bureaucrat-level data from Ghana (n=17,942) and leverage a change in the governing party to investigate hiring patterns. The results suggest that partisan bias is confined to low-ranked jobs. The findings shed light on the mixed effects of electoral competition on patronage identified in prior studies: competition may dissuade politicians from interfering in recruitment to high-ranked positions but encourage them to hire partisans for low-ranked positions.

N2  - This paper examines the determinants of sector-specific regulation imposed on broadband markets related both to efficiency objectives of regulators and to those of narrowly defined interest groups. We test hypotheses derived from the normative and positive theoretical literature employing recent panel data on 27 European Union member states taking into account endogeneity of the underlying regulation and market structure variables. Our empirical specification employs three different estimators based on instrumental variables in order to identify causal effects. We find evidence supporting both regulators pursuing normative objectives and inefficiencies related to regulatory path dependence, bureaucracy goals and an inadequate consideration of competition from mobile broadband networks. Our results call for adjustments in the institutional design of the decision-making process under the current European Union regulatory framework.

N2  - This interdisciplinary study finds that the way laws are written and treated by state regulators measurably affects bureaucratic performance: the care taken by legislatures and state agencies in developing domestic elder abuse law affects how lower-level bureaucrats investigate and reporte abuse. Perhaps more interesting, however, are two robust findings about state law making. Both legislator characteristics ( here, being middle-aged or slightly older) and lobbying by seemingly the most important interest group ( here, the American Association of Retired Persons [AARP]) sometimes have an unexpected effect. We surmise that these legislators and lobbyists find other issues both more politically attractive and more pressing since elder abuse is almost exclusively confined to the very old and helpless. However, the presence of state AARP lobbyists does predict more concern for the elderly at the administrative level. The difference between legislative and regulatory lobbying may thus reflect the differing public scrutiny given to the two.

N2  - The impact of HIV/AIDS on food security and rural livelihoods is still insufficiently understood. It is evident, however, that rural development professionals need to respond to the changes that have taken place in rural areas due to the pandemic. This article explores competencies that they need in order to deal with the complex HIV/AIDS issues related to their work with farming families. Initially 45 rural development professionals from developing countries in the southern hemisphere were interviewed about these competencies, using case stories and questionnaires. Subsequently, 34 individual in-depth interviews were conducted with rural development professionals from East Africa and Zambian government officials. A focus group discussion with 15 Zambian agricultural extension workers completed the empirical part of the research. The study reveals that there is an urgent need to complement the technical competencies of rural development professionals with more social competencies, such as counselling and communication, lobbying and networking. Recommendations are formulated for competence development of rural development professionals who have to deal with the consequences of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in rural areas.

Combining new empirical information about political behavior with a close examination of the capacity of the state's government, this second edition is a comprehensive and pointed study of the ability of the state's government to respond to the needs of a largely rural and relatively low-income population. The authors discuss public demands on state government, the shaping of the political agenda by interest groups, elections and the role of political parties, and the influence of the federal government on the state's political and administrative functions. The book also examines the nature of the state's constitution and the role of governmental institutions, including the state legislature, the governor, and the state bureaucracy, in the making of public policy and the construction of a state budget, as well as the judiciary and local governments. The concluding chapter assesses the future of governance in the state. © 2009 University of Nebraska Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: According to the traditional view of public administration, a critical component of good policy formulation is the provision of frank and fearless advice to elected decision-makers. This advice can be provided by permanent public officials or by the people selected by the elected governments to fill key and continuing posts. However, there are major questions as to whether new Governor-in-Council (GIC) appointment processes rooted in new public governance (NPG) are yielding the expected results promised, such as less partisanism, as a consideration for appointment. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a mixed methods approach to examine the GIC process as it is used in Canada. In using these methods, the authors employed interviews with senior officials, governmental documents review and expert validation interviews to triangulate its main findings. Findings: The paper uses the case of the revised appointment process for GIC appointments in Canada and suggests that the new arrangements do not deliver on merit-based criteria that ensures independence is protected between political executive and senior bureaucratic officials. Although new processes may be more open and transparent than past processes, the paper suggests that such processes are more susceptible to partisan influence under the guise of being merit-based. Research limitations/implications: The research was limited to one country context, Canada. As such, it will be necessary to expand this to other Westminster countries. Testing whether manifestations of new public governance in appointment processes elsewhere will be important to validate whether Canada is unique or not. Practical implications: The authors are left to wonder if this innovation of merit-based appointments in the new administrative state is obscuring the lines of accountability and whether it forms the basis for good policy advice despite promises to the contrary. Social implications: Trust in the government is affected by decisions behind closed doors. They appear partisan, even when they may not be. Process matters if only to highlight increased value placed on meritorious appointments. Originality/value: Previous studies on GIC appointments have generally been to explore representation as a value. That is, studies have questioned whether diversity is maintained, for example. However, few studies have explored appointment processes using institutional approaches to examine whether reforms to such processes have respected key principles, such as merit and accountability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - There is an increasing interest in the public management literature in questions related to street-level bureaucrats' (SLBs) behaviors and attitudes and how these can be influenced. Complex and ambiguous working environments require SLBs to exercise discretion, and thereby bend rules to perform their daily tasks. This study identifies factors influencing SLBs' rule-bending behaviors for procedural improvements. The concept of unbureaucratic behavior, defined as a rule-bending behavior for procedural improvements, serves as a theoretical basis. Relying on data of 1,003 enforcement officers from the German state police, this study's findings indicate that SLBs' unbureaucratic behavior can be influenced by stimulating employees' voice behavior and their readiness for strategy. Surprisingly, SLBs' access to resources does not significantly affect their exercise of unbureaucratic behavior.

N2  - This article asks if low political competition is associated with more restricted public procurement processes. Using unique Swedish municipal data from 2009 to 2015, it demonstrates that when one party dominates local politics, noncompetitive outcomes from public procurement processes are more common. What is most striking is that the risk of receiving only one bid, on what is intended to be an open and competitive tender, considerably increases with long-standing one-party rule. The article contributes to a significant body of work on the detrimental effects of low political competition, and the results are particularly interesting from a comparative perspective because Sweden—an old democracy with a meritocratic bureaucracy, characterized by low levels of corruption and clientelism—is a highly unlikely case in which to find such tendencies.

N2  - Civil-military relations has been a subject of Parameters’ articles for the life of the journal. Although interest in the topic waxes and wanes, in recent years it has been the focus of concern due to the appointment of two recently retired general officers to the post of Secretary of Defense and the ahistorical proposed use of the military by a president to address internal unrest. Undue worry over this issue, however, detracts from other more pressing problems facing civil society and our democracy today.

N2  - New medicines represent exciting possibilities to individual patients for improved futures through reduced morbidity, as well as the potential for disappointment where promised outcomes are not forthcoming. For healthcare systems these technologies can enable enhanced effectiveness as well as spiralling costs, depending on value-for-money offered. Amidst uncertainty over efficacy and pricing, institutions such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have been set up to regulate the cost-effectiveness of new products. The increased transparency of this new regulation, combined with inescapable uncertainties, leads to the heightened politicisation of decision-making and an insidious subjectivity beneath a veneer of rational-bureaucracy. This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding the infl uence of hope within such contexts. Conceptualised here as ideological, affective and prone to lapsing into trust, hope is considered to shape the lifeworld-background of regulatory decisions and mask uncertainty around effectiveness. These processes challenge regulator legitimacy and effectiveness within polycentric regimes, through the distortion of communication and the manipulation of blame.

N2  - This paper models the effect of firm-level profitability (earnings before interest and taxes and return on sales) against certification by former members of the U.S. Congress. Although some scholars have studied certification, none have studied certification in the public policy market as is done in the current work. Likewise, although scholars have studied the effects of lobbying and political connections on firms' outcomes, none have studied lobbying through former Congress members specifically. The findings confirm that, after controlling for numerous factors, firms can use former Congress members to effectively lobby and certify their intentions. Both firm-level earnings before interest and taxes and return on sales were significantly associated with prior lobbying efforts by these former elected federal officials in several different estimation techniques employed in the study.

N2  - Scholars consider the development of public relations ethics to be an integral component in professionalizing public relations. If this connection exists, the solidifying of the profession that took place from the interwar to postwar periods should provide not only evidence for this linkage, but also insight into a philosophy of public relations practice and its key ethical considerations. This study establishes the bookend years of 1936, which marked the founding of the first professional public relations association, and 1964, which marked the start of Public Relations Society of America's accreditation for practice, as defining moments in establishing a profession. An analysis of speeches from business leaders, government officials, and communication practitioners shed light on practices and ethics. The uneasiness many current scholars and professionals express toward persuasive strategies was largely absent during the formative years, as truthful advocacy via two-way communication became emblematic of public relations practice.

N2  - All EU institutions have recently faced the challenge of enlargement, the impact of which has not been limited to a change in the number of officials present or languages utilized. The transformation called into question the capacity of the common institutions to maintain an institutional identity and to absorb new members, integrating them properly into the institutional structures and procedures. The Committee of the Regions (CoR) is distinguished among the EU institutions for the broad range and variety of interests represented, a feature often identified as an obstacle for the smooth and effective work of the institution. In this context, the process of enlargement, which has substantially increased the CoR's membership and made the diversity of interests even broader, inevitably triggers the expectation of a growing degree of conflict in the Committee's internal policy-making process. The working hypothesis here is that enlargement has increased the level of internal conflict in the CoR and contributed to a further split of interests and the creation of new interest groups.

N2  - One of the fundamental features of the legal regime of collective labour relations in North America lies in bestowing, by law, a monopoly of exclusive representation upon the trade union that wins the endorsement of the majority of employees. An analogy between this type of organization and our system of representative democracy has often been made in that the people's representatives are also elected by majority rule. However, unlike parliamentary democracy, which formally allows for a margin of dissent to be expressed by representatives of the Opposition, the organization of collective labour relations fails to provide a similar forum to voice minority interests. Neglected by legislators, trade union dissent has traditionally only been able to express itself in the private circles of the trade union apparatus. However, a new phenomenon is slowly emerging in Quebec. Reacting against the wage concessions accepted by their trade unions in the wake of the government's battle against budget deficits, young teachers, young police officers and young civil servants have established their own associations: the Association pour la defense des jeunes enseignants du Quebec (ADJEQ), the Groupe d'action pour l'equite et l'egalite salariale du SPCUM (GAPES) and the Association des jeunes de la fonction publique du Quebec (AJFP). These associations are using public forums, such as parliamentary commissions, to voice their demands. Furthermore, their web sites allow minority employees to express their discontent and grievances anonymously. These new groups reflect clearly the growing complexity of labour relations in our pluralist societies and the inherent difficulties of trying to reconcile collective rights and individual rights. In their own way, those associations are also expressing real dissatisfaction with the way trade union democracy is carried out in some work environments. The new associations may possibly be the result of a transient trend linked solely to the issue of the so-called ``orphan{''} clauses, but the trade union movement would be ill-advised to disregard them. Rather, their emergence should incite trade union leaders to display greater openness, to begin dialogue and, more generally, to think about their conception of democracy and the underlying notion of equality, for such an approach has become necessary in the age of fundamental individual rights.

N2  - Within the Australian context of a shortage of skilled professionals, this article uses the Harvard model of human resources management (HRM) to conceptualise how changes in stakeholder interests coupled with changes to situational factors affect public sector HRM policy choices that in turn affect HRM outcomes for different types of public sector employees. The findings obtained using path analysis suggest that the proposed model explained almost 50\% for nurses and less than 14\% for police officers. In the case of nurses, the strong significant relationship between HRM inputs and outputs may provide a further plausible explanation for one of the long-term consequences of new public management - namely, the inability to retain skilled employees (especially those in the health sector) across numerous OECD countries. The implication of these findings is that the present public sector HRM policy choice should be re-examined because of its impact on HRM outcomes. Moreover, public sector employees should not be regarded as one uniform group that responds alike to the same policy. Whilst the merits of pursuing a strong auditing focus may have benefited organisations financially, the benefits can only remain if public sector employees, including professionals, are prepared to work under those conditions. The inability to retain nurses in numerous countries, coupled with past studies that have identified (poor) management as a contributing factor, suggests that past HRM policy choices may have to be replaced by new HRM policy choices that focus on employees' perceptions of well-being. However, more studies using different types of professionals are required to confirm the generalisability of these findings.

N2  - The politics of fair employment policy revolves around the shift from equal employment opportunity to affirmative action. Federal judges, presidents and bureaucrats, members of Congress, political parties, coalitions of interest groups, and political activists have functioned within a political environment that has evolved from controversy and divisiveness to general consensus and agreement to renewed conflict and tension. Congress was slow to respond to demands for civil rights legislation; no such action was taken between Reconstruction and 1957. By the middle of 1963, debate in Congress focused on the public accommodations provisions of the civil rights bills that were before it because great attention had been generated by the sit-ins and demonstrations directed at restaurant and hotel operators who refused to serve black customers. The passage of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 was a defeat for civil rights groups, whose major goal had been to empower the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to issue cease-and-desist orders against discriminatory employment practices.

N2  - This research investigated the role of a public interest group, Canada's Coalition for Public Information, in the federal information policymaking process for the information highway. The investigation followed the example of naturalistic methods described in grounded theory and extended case methodologies. Two public policy models that explore the policy-making process and policy community were used as the framework for building an understanding of events, context, stakeholders, strategies, and influence. The researcher concluded that CPI exercised little influence over policy outcomes. CPI remained outside the decision-making network of government officials and private sector representatives owing to its limited resources, limited political experience, and its late entry into the policy process. However, CPI did succeed in helping to bring a perspective other than the market agenda to the public and to the policy community.

N2  - A growing body of literature suggests that the personal characteristics of public officials have an effect on policy outcomes. But scholars differ as to which of the two primary methods for selecting public officials-elections and appointments-are more likely to produce high quality officials. Using original data on the backgrounds of Russian mayors between 2000 and 2012, we examine how the biographies of elected and appointed mayors differ. We find that differences between the two types of officials are modest, but noteworthy. On the one hand, elected mayors have more experience holding elected office and are more educated, which could indicate that they are of higher quality. Moreover, elected mayors turn over at a much lower rate, which indicates lower levels of political instability. Yet appointed mayors have more executive governing experience and are less likely to come from business backgrounds, which may indicate that elections provide more opportunities for business capture. Overall, our findings indicate that Russia's flawed elections may be a double-edged sword when it comes to the selection of quality officials.

N2  - Understanding how coalition parties in multiparty governments divide office and policy payoffs is one of the greatest challenges in political science. Gamson’s Law predicts that ministries are allocated proportionally with the coalition members’ legislative seat holding. However, doubts remain about how differences in the valuation of portfolios affect their distribution. The challenge is not only to determine whether government parties receive their fair share of cabinet payoffs once the importance of individual ministerial posts is taken into consideration, but also to develop a measure of portfolio importance that takes time and context into account. This article proposes a new method of measuring portfolio salience using official records of cabinet appointments in the Fifth French Republic that list ministerial posts hierarchically. The result is a more nuanced measure of portfolio importance, which is context sensitive and varies with time. The article argues that the new measure is able to reduce artificial deviations from the one-to-one linkage of seat shares and portfolio shares and that it can travel beyond the French case.

N2  - Introduction As we made our way through the narrow alleys that cut across Nima and Maamobi, two adjacent low-income communities in Accra, Ghana, Joe, a local human rights activist, updated me about some of the recent events in the community. We passed concrete and plywood homes and small shops, while navigating around livestock and the deteriorating open drains that bisect many of the walkways. There are only a few roads in the community that are large enough for vehicles, so residents generally travel by way of the labyrinth of paths that wind through the densely populated neighbourhoods. Nima and Maamobi, although not officially separate municipalities, joined together to become a self-designated human rights city. In addition to their status as a human rights city, the two neighbourhoods are united by the fact that they are often perceived by outsiders as being distinct from the surrounding city. In contrast to the rest of Accra, which is largely Christian and relatively wealthy, Nima and Maamobi have a large Islamic population and many residents are significantly poorer than other Accra residents. The neighbourhoods of Nima and Maamobi are unplanned and have long carried the reputation of being migrant communities. In 1973, Grindal estimated that 90 per cent of the communities’ population ‘is ethnically non-indigenous, consisting of northern tribesmen and a significantly large proportion of non-Ghanaians from northern Togo and Upper Volta’ (1973: 335). Some residents feel that the ethnic, religious, and economic diversity of the area has led them to be treated by policy makers as non-indigenous and transitory, and therefore less worthy of much-needed development funds. In this chapter, I argue that the status of the Nima and Maamobi human rights city (as a ‘city within a city’ (White 2011: 275)) poses unique challenges for local human rights activists. One of the primary challenges faced by local activists is how to pursue large-scale community development projects using the human rights framework rather than the system of political patronage, which is prevalent in Ghana. Although common across Ghana (Hasty 2005; Lentz 1998; Nugent 1995), strong patronage relationships are particularly prevalent in unplanned communities where residents often find difficulty accessing things like employment, credit, and government officials (Fox 2014). © Cambridge University Press 2016.

N2  - Studies of venue shopping have typically analyzed the case of an individual advocacy group or issue campaign rather than comparing venue strategies across multiple groups. Moreover, this literature focuses on interest groups and advocacy coalitions whose principal mandate is to influence public policy. Using original data, we test theories of venue selection among nonprofit organizations that report engaging in policy processes but the majority of which do not self-identify as an advocacy group. Our analyses explore the "where" of nonprofit advocacy across three different venue types: branch (executive, legislative), domain (bureaucracy, elected officials), and level of government (local, state, federal). Like interest groups, we find that nonprofits shop among both executive and legislative branches and among elected and bureaucratic domains; however, they tend to specialize in one level of government. Geographic scope and revenue source predicted venue targeting, but most other organizational characteristics including age, capacity, and structure did not.

N2  - The article deals with the issue of structural and cohesion funding by the European Union in Poland. Although all funds for the first programming period 2004-6 were allocated, the process did not occur without problems. Therefore, in our paper we point to the weaknesses of the system and some of the crucial barriers that hindered efficient fund allocation: faulty institutional and legal framework, bureaucracy, corruption and personnel deficits. We base our findings on research of interviews carried out in four regions of Poland. Referring to Niklas Luhmann's theory of autopoietic system, we sketch an image of an unevenly differentiated political system, in which administration and politics prevail over the underdeveloped and weak public, incapable of counteracting trends of politicization and expanded.

N2  - How bureaucracies respond publicly to policy inputs received in the context of stakeholder participation in policymaking provides important insights into their reputation-building strategies. We examine the European Commission's public engagement with stakeholders' inputs. We argue this is driven by its attempts to simultaneously consolidate its core, well-established reputation as a responsible policymaker, and cultivate a newer reputation as a responsive to public demands institution. This helps navigating the challenges of having to find new sources of authority and legitimacy (embedded in participatory policymaking) while also maintaining its more established ones (embedded in evidence-based policymaking). We analyse a new dataset recording stakeholders' inputs received as part of the EC's legislative simplification programme. We find the Commission prioritised strengthening its core reputation over cultivating its emergent one. Evidence-based inputs were significantly more likely to receive an EC public response and inform its legislative simplification programme relative to opinion-based ones. Citizens' inputs were significantly less likely to receive a response and inform the programme. Our findings diverge from research indicating bureaucracies prioritise defending their emerging reputations, highlight the Commission's commitment to maintain its reputational and institutional uniqueness in the EU regulatory state, and reveal a reputation-building approach akin to that of EU agencies.

N2  - The paper investigates the link between the sub-national variation of political regimes in a (at the federal level) non-democratic country and the appointments of federal officials in the sub-national provinces. In particular, we look at the appointment of the chief federal inspectors to the regions in Putin's Russia in 2000-2012. Our main research question is whether appointment patterns can be explained by top-down concerns of the central government willing to keep control over the most unruly regions or by bottom-up self-selection of bureaucrats belonging to influential groups into more attractive positions more suitable for rent-seeking. The advantage of our case is that data we have at hand allow us to distinguish these two logics. Our results indicate that for the Russian chief federal inspectors in 2000-2012 bottom-up self-selection appears to be the more plausible explanation of the link between sub-national political regimes and appointment patterns.

N2  - Scholarly work in the 1990s indicated that the values of civil servants in late colonial Hong Kong were evolving from those of classical bureaucrats to those of more political bureaucrats as the political and social environment changed. Based on in-depth interviews with 58 politicians and senior civil servants carried out between 2009 and 2012, we argue that Hong Kong civil service values have adapted owing in part to external shocks such as regime change and governance reform. Still, traditional civil service values such as fiscal prudence and balancing various community interests continue to be prominent. We illustrate the influence of civil service values in two policymaking cases: small-class teaching and minimum-wage legislation.

N2  - One conclusion in the literature on domestic European Union (EU) coordination is that the formal institutional properties of countries-devolved versus centralized or unitary-affect the nature of coordination practices. Basically, the view has emerged that domestic coordination is a largely bureaucratic process in which political control mechanisms remain relatively weak. Instead of only looking at public authorities and their formal networks, this article relies on a data set that allows us to analyse informal political-administrative networks and look at how societal interests mobilize and target policymakers in order to shape the position governments defend at the EU level. One of our conclusions is that despite devolution in Belgium, its intergovernmental coordination shows a considerable level of network centralization, even when compared to unitary countries such as France and the Netherlands, meaning that there are large differences between the three states with respect to the connectedness of the actors involved.

N2  - Interest organizations are hypothesized to strongly affect public policy, but the evidence that they do so is mixed. This article argues that one reason for the disparity is a gap between theory and research: theory suggests that information provided by interest organizations should strongly influence elected officials, but there is no systematic research on its impact. We examine a potentially important source of information for members of the U.S. Congress - testimony at committee hearings - to ascertain if it affects the enactment of policy proposals. The data, based on content analysis of almost 1,000 testimonies on a stratified random sample of policy proposals, describe who testifies, their arguments, and the evidence they provide. Supporters of a proposal emphasize the importance of the problem being addressed, while opponents claim the proposed policy will be ineffective and try to reframe the debate. Information - particularly information regarding policy effectiveness - does affect the likelihood that a policy proposal will be enacted.

N2  - The Public Defender's Office is essential for the Justice System functioning, so that evaluating the performance of this organization is fundamental to improving the provision of justice services in the country. This article aims to propose and test an index of performance for the Brazilian Federal Public Defender's Office (DPU). The data were collected through interviews with defenders and managers and on secondary official bases of the organization and analyzed through content analysis and exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis. The results show that, in the interviewees' perception, the performance of the Public Defender's Office should be based on the following categories: productivity, success, service capacity, quality of service, speed, access, decongesting and extrajudicial action. The results of the factorial analysis demonstrate the validity of a performance index composed of four factors, such as: assistance to citizens, number of citizens assisted, extrajudicial conciliation and success rate. The application of the index shows that the performance of the DPU has been decreasing over the last years - 2014 to 2017.

N2  - This article develops the concept of `mediating bureaucrats' by exploring their role during liberal reforms that led to rehabilitation of the sugar industry in Mozambique. By focusing on how relations between the state, government and business are mediated by a group of cadres who have occupied positions in different social domains, the article argues that these `mediating bureaucrats' cannot easily be identified in one-dimensional terms as belonging to either the public or private sector, the state or the market. It is argued that as `socially embedded actors', the group of `mediating bureaucrats' are in a position to translate and mediate between diverse and sometimes conflicting interests and aspirations of the state, the government and business. We use the rehabilitation of the sugar industry in Mozambique to show how mediating bureaucrats adopted two practices - muddling through and translation - in order to straddle conflicting interests during different reform initiatives in post-independence Mozambique.

N2  - This paper examines the nature of state-business relations and how interest groups utilise the budget process to lobby for tax and expenditure policies in Zambia, using information compiled from budget proposals interest groups submit towards the budget and lobbying activity data published in the daily newspapers between 2006 and 2008. The data shows a significant increase in interest groups formed especially in the civil society segmented and improvements in state-business relations, although not formalised and institutionalised, since political liberalisation in 1991. Analysis of lobbying data indicates that interest groups utilise the formal budget processes and informal policy networks such as the media to lobby unilaterally and collectively for favourable tax and expenditure policies. Tax proposals submitted through government departments had a greater chance of being adopted in the budget as bureaucrats assisted to shepherd them through the budget process. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - This article explores how local civil servants produce the conditions of possibility for bureaucratic authority in Nepal's contested political environment of war and post-war 'transition'. Specifically, it examines the everyday practices of local civil servants as they attempt to influence the distribution of such public resources as agricultural inputs and local government budgets. The article asks: how do local civil servants produce the authority necessary to get things done in the face of changing local government structures and rival authority claims from both wartime Maoist People's Governments and resurgent patronage politics in the post-war period? In a context characterized as 'ordinary extraordinary', the article suggests that local civil servants employ a form of practice that has been termed 'tactical government' and proposes three distinct forms of this practice. However, the article also argues that tactical practice tells only part of the story and that it can be insightful to enrich our understanding of tactical government with an analysis of more general life projects. Bureaucratic practices are also motivated by factors such as the significance of the contested resource and paternal ideas of 'the common good'. Such a suggestion is in line with recent work on everyday lives in situations of protracted violent conflict and insecurity, and on the role of culture in producing civil servants/services. Looking at these two forms of practice together, in particular their interconnections, gives us a fuller account of how authority is produced. Furthermore, it allows more nuanced and detailed perspectives into the complex process of state-making.

N2  - In addition to his very considerable and influential body of scholarship, and his roles as a pathfinder and senior leader of cultural studies in Australia and beyond, Graeme Turner has made a profound if less well-known contribution as an advocate and adviser at the national level, for cultural studies and the wider humanities. Turner's election in 2004 as President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities was greeted by elements of the conservative commentariat as the final proof of the complete annihilation of sense and meaning in Australian universities. Within four years, Turner had garnered sufficient respect to be appointed personally to the nation's preeminent science and research advisory body, the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, a distinction confirmed by his reappointment in 2012. This article offers an intimate account of Turner's advocacy and policy activities, detailing many of the achievements, along with some of the frustrating near-misses, of his work during and after his Presidency. It traces his development from a seasoned institutional player and accomplished scholar, encountering the dual challenges of slippery politics and leaden bureaucracy, to his rapid emergence as an expert political operator quite at home (if a little cold) in Canberra. The article proposes a theory of Turner's approach, beyond his well-known work ethic, intellectual acuity and force of personality, conceiving of his advocacy and policy work as a species of cultural studies itself - an enactment of a politically engaged cultural practice - as much as an initiative on its behalf. This account looks back to Turner's own cultural scholarship for insights into his deployment of a highly sophisticated intellectual toolkit in a theoretically informed practice, to gain the attention, respect and support of politicians, public servants, industry leaders and the powerful science lobby.

N2  - Greece has shouldered a heavy burden in the global economic crisis, struggling with political and financial insecurity. Greece has also the most porous external border of the European Union, tasked with ensuring that the EU's boundaries are both "secure and humanitarian" and hosting enormous numbers of migrants and asylum seekers who arrive by land and sea. The recent leadership and fiscal crises have led to a breakdown of legal entitlements for both Greek citizens and those seeking refuge within the country's borders. On the Doorstep of Europe is an ethnographic study of the asylum system in Greece, tracing the ways asylum seekers, bureaucrats, and service providers attempt to navigate the dilemmas of governance, ethics, knowledge, and sociability that emerge through this legal process. Centering on the work of an asylum advocacy NGO in Athens, Heath Cabot explores how workers and clients grapple with predicaments endemic to Europeanization and rights-based protection. Drawing inspiration from classical Greek tragedy to highlight both the transformative potential and the violence of law, Cabot charts the structural violence effected through European governance, rights frameworks, and humanitarian intervention while also exploring how Athenian society is being remade from the inside out. She shows how, in contemporary Greece, relationships between insiders and outsiders are radically reconfigured through legal, political, and economic crises. In addition to providing a textured, on-the-ground account of the fraught context of asylum and immigration in Europe's borderlands, On the Doorstep of Europe highlights the unpredictable and transformative ways in which those in host nations navigate legal and political violence, even in contexts of inexorable duress and inequality. © 2014 University of Pennsylvania Press.

N2  - Recent literature on "soft authoritarianism" has called into question the extent to which policy, rather than personality and patronage, sets the direction of elite politics in the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). This strand of thinking argues that the state's direction toward "reform" is not as coherent as commonly believed, a relevant model for examining the role of the state-owned print and online press as an arm of Vietnam's post-communist marketization project. It argues that Party leaders, facing a breakdown of consensus across the spectrum of political and business elites, are using the press in an attempt to manage a growing number of voices in the political system, but that reporting on many political and corruption scandals has simply become unmanageable for state leaders. Under this paradigm, policy debates between "reformers" and "conservatives" in Vietnam fall short of explaining press censorship. This semidemocratic concept of the media's role opens up room for a wider understanding of civil society under transitional regimes in Asia. This paper draws on twenty-nine interviews with Vietnamese journalists, editors, media executives, Vietnamese and foreign journalism trainers, and government officials from 2010 to 2011, as well as an analysis of press coverage and internal newsroom documents. © The Author(s) 2013.

N2  - Since 1999, when the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act expired, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has had in place regulations providing for the appointment of "special counsels"who possess "the full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney."Appointments under these regulations, such as the May 17, 2017 appointment of Robert S. Mueller to investigate the Trump campaign, are patently unlawful, for three distinct reasons. First, all federal offices must be "established by Law,"and there is no statute authorizing such an office in the DOJ. We conduct what we think is the first thorough examination of the statutes structuring the DOJ to show that the statutory provisions relied upon by the DOJ and lower courts for the appointment of special counsels over the past two decades do not - and even obviously do not - authorize the creation and appointment of special counsels at the level of United States Attorneys. They authorize the creation and appointment of special counsels to "assist"United States Attorneys, and they allow existing Senate-confirmed United States Attorneys to serve also as special counsels, but they do not remotely authorize the creation of the kind of special counsels represented by Robert Mueller who replace rather than assist United States Attorneys. United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), does not hold to the contrary, because no question was raised in that case about the validity of the independent counsel's appointment. Second, even if one chooses to overlook the absence of statutory authority for the position, there is no statute specifically authorizing the Attorney General, rather than the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint such a special counsel. Under the Appointments Clause, inferior officers can be appointed by department heads only if Congress so directs by statute - and so directs specifically enough to overcome a clear-statement presumption in favor of presidential appointment and senatorial confirmation. No such statute exists for the special counsel. Third, the special counsel is, in all events, a superior rather than inferior officer, and thus cannot be appointed by any means other than presidential appointment and senatorial confirmation regardless of what any statutes purport to say. This is obviously true as a matter of original meaning, and it is even true as a matter of case law once one understands that neither Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), nor Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651 (1997), can plausibly be read to say that any person who is in any fashion subordinate to another executive official is an "inferior"officer. Such a reading of those decisions leads to the ludicrous result that there is only one noninferior officer in every federal department, which is a good reason not to read them that way. There are surely times when special counsels are appropriate. Both statutes and the Constitution provide ample means for such appointments through the use of existing United States Attorneys with unimpeachable credentials and reputations for standing above politics. Any number of United States Attorneys have performed these functions with distinction. Statutes and the Constitution do not, however, permit the Attorney General to appoint a private citizen as a substitute United States Attorney under the title "special counsel."That is what happened on May 17, 2017. That appointment was unlawful, as are all of the legal actions that have flowed from it. The D.C. Circuit's unreasoned February 26, 2019 opinion in In re Grand Jury Investigation upholding Mueller's appointment does not come to grips with any of these arguments. The panel decision asserts (falsely) that the issues were either waived by the party challenging the appointment or are readily resolved by Supreme Court precedent. If the latter claim was true, those precedents would cry out for clarification or reconsideration by the Court. But that latter claim is only even minimally plausible based on the most superficial skimming of the applicable precedents. The statutory and constitutional structure of federal law enforcement is a serious matter, and one might have hoped that the federal courts - and the Department of Justice - would devote a bit more mental energy to that matter than they have thus far expended.

N2  - This paper examines the appointment of male versus female career diplomats to ambassadorial posts. We assess the role played by ambassadors' individual characteristics, including education, marital status, and number of children, and host countries' characteristics, such as quality of life and regime type, in determining if a male or female is appointed to ambassadorial positions to represent the United States in foreign countries. The time frame of this study is the entire presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush (1993-2008), during which 603 career diplomats were appointed as ambassadors. The study provides empirical evidence that there remain significant differences between women and men serving as ambassadors. Female ambassadors are more likely to be single and have no children and are less likely to be Ivy League graduates than male ambassadors. Furthermore, they are more likely to be appointed to countries with lower quality of life and better human rights records. Finally, time plays a role in the likelihood of a woman being appointed as ambassador.

N2  - This article examines the way in which the news media frame public policy issues and the extent to which other political players (e.g., interest groups, politicians) influence this issue framing process. Our analysis focuses on the issue of gun control, comparing the rhetoric generated by interest groups and public officials on the Brady Bill and Assault Weapons Ban with actual network news coverage of this legislation from 1988 to 1996. Results indicate that both sets of political players employed several interpretative issue frames and worked hard to put their preferred themes on the agenda. However, at times, the media intervened in the framing process, especially as the debate matured. Specifically, the news media (a) structured the overall tone of the gun control debate, (b) adopted a distribution of framing perspectives different from that of politicians and interest groups, and (c) packaged policy discourse more often than not in terms of the "culture of violence" theme. These findings point toward previously ignored media effects and attest to the potential role the media play in shaping public policy debates.

N2  - A synopsis of the state of affairs of the Vietnam veterans lobby illustrates that veterans' interest-group activity is filled with conflict. First, we acknowledge the efforts of the veterans' community before Vietnam. Second, we summarize the activism that developed during the Vietnam decade, noting the conflict between the World War II/Korea veterans and the Vietnam "Homecomers." That clash provided the rationale for two bureaucratic "wars" over control of veterans' policy, programs, budgets, and the client base of Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans: one involving the (then) Veterans Administration (VA) and Health, Education, and Welfare over veterans' educational programs, the other involving the VA and Department of Labor over veteran outreach centers. We summarize two salient issues: Agent Orange and small-business opportunities. Finally, we illustrate that the difficulties confronted by the Vietnam generation also confront the Gulf War/Afghanistan and Iraq veterans. We conclude with comments about the possible future of the veterans as an interest group and the Department of Veterans Affairs. © 2007 Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society.

N2  - This article is an analysis of a controversial policy decision on the part of the newly elected Democratic Alliance local administration in Cape Town, South Africa, to fire senior officials of the previous African National Congress administration and to introduce an interim policy for senior managers that stated that such positions should be filled by people who are 'politically suitable and acceptable' to the ruling party. The author of this article was part of a team that reviewed this policy. This article is an account of this process. The author developed, on the basis of comparative experience, a heuristic model that could serve as the basis for gauging the extent of politicians' involvement in the appointment of staff. A continuum illustrating the different approaches to council appointment of staff was generated. Five different approaches were identified, namely neutral, minimalist appointment of senior staff, appoinment of top and middle-level staff, large-scale appointment in all ranks and fusion of party/state. The report concluded that the most appropriate of these models is the minimalist appoinment model whereby councillors should have the right to appoint certain selected senior staff.

N2  - This article is an overview of shifting political-administrative relationships in South Africa, with particular reference to growing politicization (partisan control of the bureaucracy). Studies of politicization of public services are important because political involvement in management has often led to negative effects on service delivery. The article sets out a theoretical framework for political-administrative relationships, examining the growing politicization of public services, the impact of New Public Management (NPM) and political-administrative relationships in developing countries. It then looks at political-administrative relationships in South Africa, including the apartheid history, the development of a new framework in the democratic South Africa and politicization in the staffing of the public service. It examines three functional areas - the decentralization of powers, contract appointments and performance management - and discusses the implications of this changing framework for service delivery. The methodology consisted of interviews with a number of senior government officials, including three current directors-general and a former Minister for the Public Service and Administration, an analysis of government legislation, Public Service Commission (PSC) data including surveys, unpublished data of the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA), policy papers of the African National Congress (ANC) and an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study of political involvement in bureaucracies. The article concludes that growing politicization of the public service has contributed to poor service delivery, and that the South African government needs to place greater emphasis on merit as the basis for appointments and promotions. Points for practitioners This article is useful for professionals working in public management and administration because it looks at the following debates and issues, which have practical implications: frameworks for understanding political-administrative relationships in the public service; the impact of the politicization of staff in the public service; and how merit-based appointment can improve government effectiveness. The article also offers lessons to developing countries wishing to create more professional public services.

N2  - Corruption undermines government effectiveness and performance pay may be used as a “legal bribe” to encourage bureaucrats to act honestly. However, if performance pay is awarded based on loyalty rather than performance, its use may aggravate corruption rather than reduce it. Collusion is facilitated when patronage crowds out merit in the public sector recruitment process, and this study, therefore, tests whether the relationship between performance pay and corruption is conditioned by patronage-based recruitment. A model of corruption is estimated using data from an expert survey of performance pay usage in government in over 100 countries and both a survey-based measure of patronage and a multi-source patronage risk index. A series of cross-country regressions suggest that the effect of performance pay on corruption is negative when patronage is low but either non-significant or positive in countries where patronage pervades the recruitment process. This study demonstrates how a popular anti-corruption reform may interact with competing incentives embedded in the context of implementation to worsen corruption. © 2020

N2  - For some thirty years now I have been trying to study various issues of public policy in Japan. Although unfortunately policy studies are not very trendy in the general field of political science at the moment, they have been popular among Japan specialists for a long time and are still seen as mainstream. While some who do policy studies emphasize a structural approach (particularly in political economy) and others mostly employ a "unitary rational actor" model (particularly to analyze foreign policy), people like me try to relate aspects of political process (what bureaucracies, parties, or interest groups actually do) to the substance of policy (what governments do, why they implement one kind of policy-good or bad-rather than another). Any of these approaches to public policy can be substantially enriched by comparing Japan with other countries. © 2003 by University of Hawai'i Press.

type/locus (customs)
N2  - An ethnographic approach is applied to Cameroon customs to explore the role and capacity of bureaucratic elites to reform. Fighting against corruption has led to the extraction and circulation of legal 'collective money' that fuels internal funds. This collective money is the core of the senior officers' power and authority. Nevertheless, when reforming, senior officers face major problems. Reformers depend on an unpredictable appointment process, driven by the political will to fight against corruption and the fact that the political authority has to keep a close eye on the customs apparatus that tends towards autonomy, thanks to its internal funds. Violence and collective representations weaken the legitimacy of the senior officers, even the reformers, by pushing individual skills into the background. This chapter questions whether Cameroon's use of customs data to evaluate individual performance can open up fissures among customs elites such that reformers are distinguished from others.

N2  - In recent years, the Chinese government emphasizes the civil servants team should be younger in age and that young civil servants under the age of 30 which account for about 20\% of the total have become the main force of the policy implementation. The study suggests that organizational citizenship behaviors have played an important role in promoting the overall performance of civil servants, advancing the government mechanism reform and building a service-oriented government. The thesis, based on young civil servants as the research object, analyzed the situation of young civil servants in organizational citizenship behavior which is not high. Moreover, it analyzes the causes for such features and puts forward measures with the aim of promoting organizational citizenship behaviors of young civil servant. Our country is in a crucial stage of administrative system reform and speeding up the reform of the administrative system and building a service-oriented government has become a current priority task. The service consciousness of civil servants is fundamental for building a public service government, while young civil servants have accounted for a large part of the civil servant groups. The research suggests, however, there is an obvious utilitarian value in young civil servants, also, there are problems such as excessive pursuit of material interests, lack of social responsibility and higher emotional job burnout. What's more, due to the specialty of the public sector, the area of responsibility of the civil servants cannot be clearly defined. The study focuses on issues which are how to break the limitation of responsibility and encourage young civil servants to perform their duties as well as how to take initiative to do the organizational citizenship behaviors without personal private interests and for the sake of the public interests.

N2  - This paper explores the discretion issue of social workers (educators, social-health operators, and administrative employees included) in light of the street-level theory and the concept of “situated agency”. From the analysis of the interviews administered in two public services in Northern Italy, the lack of resources has emerged as the most important dilemma for social workers, as well as the prime mover of their coping strategies: it requires the selection of users and the service rationing; it affects discretion, since it reduces the options for deliverable interventions and the relationship space for users; and, finally, it risks transforming social work into relational support. Even in this situation, social workers seem to be policy makers only in a narrower sense than the one assumed in literature, since they do not participate in social planning and in that one of their organization, and they actually renounce to voice and policy advocacy.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to explain the logic of the appointment process for officer and commander of the National Guard in Chile, in the mid-nineteenth century. The study of the recommendations for these civic positions, reviewed in the General Archive of the Army and in documents of the Ministry of War, indicates that public order would not reside as much in the imposition of the State as in the willingness of decent men to collaborate. In effect, local powers assume the positions and mobilize their social resources, recommending those who have the capacity to ensure tranquility in their territories. This 'logic of the acquaintance' would explain the functioning of the National Guard in the diffuse boundaries between State and society and would show that this is not a consolidated State but one in construction that, despite its precariousness, well uses the strengths of the local social fabric.

N2  - This article describes the recruitment, training and career paths of women judges and public prosecutors in Syria over a period of 30 years (1975–2005). It analyses both quantitative and qualitative data drawn from official statistics and interviews conducted with 67 women judges and public prosecutors in Syria’s largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo. The paper focuses on how training of the judiciary has changed since the founding of the new Institute of Judicial Studies and the effect this change has had on women’s career paths. The entry of women to the judiciary in 1975 and the restructuring of the training system in 2002 are the two most important events in the recent history of the judiciary in Syria.

N2  - This article discusses the politicization of the bureaucratic structures of the Brazilian municipalities based on appointed positions. The intention is to demonstrate patterns of political appointments that reflect institutional performance. The data were provided by Munic/IBGE 2005/14 and IpoC- Mstituicoes Politicas Comparadas/UFRGS. Firstly, the study observed the degree of variability of the distribution of these positions in municipal structures, and the quality of the appointees' education. Then, an analysis of spatial, global, and local dependence was performed. In addition, the difference in performance among municipalities was statistically tested using the independent t-test. The test compared municipalities' performance concerning the number and education of appointees. The study used the Municipal GDP-Per-Capita, the Indice Firjan de Desenvolvimento Municipal (IFDM), and the Indice de Governanca Municipal (IGM) created by the Federal Board of Administration as proxies for performance. The results stress the complexity of local public management since some of the tests indicate the number and education of appointees as predictors of high performance while other studies do not find the same relationship.

N2  - This paper describes types, processes and importance of rent-seeking in the allocation of timber rights in Ghana. It is based on an analysis of 30 interviews with large-, medium-and small-scale timber firms, as well as government officials and timber industry organizations in Ghana. The paper documents that timber rights allocation is associated with both bureaucratic and political corruption. The latter comes in two forms. First, the findings suggest that well-established relationships exist between politicians and senior bureaucrats on the one side and large-scale timber firms on the other involving exchange of timber rights for political support and/or material, personal benefits. Second, timber rights are allocated to persons or firms outside the timber sector allegedly as payment for political support. The paper concludes that the Voluntary Partnership Agreement between Ghana and the EU is likely to reduce the observed practises in the future through increased transparency.

N2  - The contestability of delegated government actions remains one of the bedrock questions of administrative law. In what sense are policies and decisions that may ultimately reflect the will of the elective branches of American government, but that are necessarily given to administrative officials, subject to challenge by those affected, or even by those who are not? In the wake of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) of 1946, an entire literature and subdiscipline of law has arisen, seeking to define the appropriate bounds of administrative discretion and to identify those institutions – whether in APA-related procedures of notice-and-comment rulemaking or in cost–benefit analysis of proposed rules coupled with unitary executive review – that best constrain this discretion while preserving socially beneficial public policies. No self-respecting law school neglects to fill out a roster of administrative law teachers and scholars, and there remain many applied fields of law (food and drug law, communications law, environmental law) in which the institutions and precepts of American administrative law figure critically in teaching and scholarship. Political scientists and other social scientists have, finally, rendered their own contributions to the field of administrative law. These contributions came in several waves, not least in the sober reminders of scholars that the APA and its institutions could be used for political control over the bureaucratic state, that rulemaking institutions attract special interest pressure, and, most recently, that executive regulatory review itself is an important site of lobbying. Institutions that constrain the administrative state open themselves yet more venues for special interest influence. To this day, however, a prominent and occasionally influential practice of contestation – the petition to an administrative agency – has largely escaped the administrative lawyer’s notice. The collective ignorance of the administrative petition appears especially puzzling, given the frequent use of these institutions by businesses, consumer groups, law firms, and other entities in American political economy. The rulemaking petitions with which administrative lawyers are familiar today compose just the tendril legacy of a much richer pattern of supplicating administrative officials and organizations, a pattern that goes back centuries.

N2  - The US government creates astonishingly complete records of policy creation in executive agencies. In this article, we describe the major kinds of data that have proven useful to scholars studying interest group behavior and influence in bureaucratic politics, how to obtain them, and challenges that we as users have encountered in working with these data. We discuss established databases such as regulations.gov, which contains comments on draft agency rules, and newer sources of data, such as ex-parte meeting logs, which describe the interest groups and individual lobbyists that bureaucrats are meeting face-to-face about proposed policies. One challenge is that much of these data are not machine-readable. We argue that scholars should invest in several projects to make these datasets machine-readable and to link them to each other as well as to other databases.

N2  - A deep understanding of the use of deliberative processes requires a political ethnography able to detect their consequences for the participants and for the public sphere. This article analyses a participatory process organised in France by an activist-professional facilitator with a small group of bureaucrats and marginalized individuals, designed to promote mutual understanding and raise public issues. This ethnography shows that deliberation in small groups, rather than merely producing consensus and reproducing inequalities in accessing forms of public expression as is sometimes alleged, may generate at least preliminary politicization and the publicization of social issues in working-class districts. These rather fragile effects raise the question of the continuity of collective action and institutional transformations generated by deliberative processes. © 2016, © 2016 European Sociological Association.

N2  - This article focuses on practices and meanings of time and waiting experienced by poor, low-class Dalits and Muslims in their routine encounters with the state in India. Drawing on ethnographic research from Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, it presents experiences of waiting around queuing and applying for paperwork, cards, and welfare schemes, in order to examine the role of temporal processes in the production of citizenship and citizen agency. An analysis of various forms of waiting – ‘on the day’, ‘to and fro’, and ‘chronic’ waiting – reveals how temporal processes operate as mechanisms of power and control through which state actors and other mediators produce differentiated forms of citizenship and citizens. Temporal processes and their material outcomes, we argue, are shaped by class, caste and religion, while also drawing on – and reproducing – gendered identities and inequalities. However, rather than being ‘passive’ patients of the state, we show how ordinary people draw on money, patronage networks and various performative acts in an attempt to secure their rights as citizens of India.

N2  - The level or rank of an administrative division in China—a structural condition of the sub-national territorial administrative system—is a correlate of administrative rank. State reterritorialization of the administrative divisions, through establishment and expansion of hundreds of cities, introduces a political economy of differentiation and change by which city governments take the measure of their administrative reach and economic capacity. How do changes to the administrative divisions involve administrative rank, economic status and territorial governing power? In Suzhou, a prefecture-level city, incommensurability between the economic status of the city and its administrative rank reveals how ‘unfair’ rank in the administrative hierarchy becomes implicated in negotiations over territorial adjustments and cadre appointments, leading to creative forms of rank adjustment. Dynamics of the administrative divisions reflect rank consciousness, influence official positions and structure urban transformation in contemporary China.

N2  - Several authors have analysed how institutionalized women's movements impact policy, but research has devoted little attention to the differentiated impact of institutionalized movements on the substantive and symbolic dimensions of the same policy. I investigate this issue by focusing on the Bolivian movement of domestic workers, a paradigmatic case of an institutionalized women's movement that had a sound impact on the symbolic dimension of the policy on domestic workers' rights but a much weaker impact on its substantive dimension. The research is based on qualitative content analysis of documents produced by the movement and the government, and semi-structured interviews with key actors. I have reached three main findings. First, institutionalization facilitates the achievement of symbolic policy out-comes, but does not necessarily allow the achievement of substantive policy outcomes. Second, the inclusion of movements in deliberative processes that imply the joint elaboration of policy seems to be the form of institutionalization that allows the strongest impact on the substantive dimension of policy, while the appointment of movement members to official positions is less effective. Third, a form of institutionalization that was not included in existent typologies has been identified: the recognition of the importance of a movement by the government.

N2  - The Trade Union Act 2016 contains further changes to the role of the Certification Officer (CO) following the changes introduced by the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014 which gave supervisory, investigative and enforcement powers over new membership record requirements designed to assist with legal challenges to industrial action. The enhanced powers of investigation and the ability to exercise powers without receiving a complaint from a trade union member are now applied across much of the CO's jurisdiction. To these are added additional enforcement powers and the power to impose financial penalties, with the Secretary of State having power to make provision for the CO to impose a levy on trade unions. The role of the CO, now described by the Government as that of a 'regulator', is politicised to an unprecedented degree and is transformed into that of instigator, investigator, prosecutor, adjudicator and sentencer. Unlike even the measures introduced by Conservative governments from 1980 to 1997, the provisions fail to take account of the protection of trade union autonomy in international law. Having already optimised the opportunities for legal challenges to industrial action, these measures are designed to heap unwarranted administrative burdens and expense on trade unions.

N2  - Even though some level of politicization is pressed into the "genetic material" of administrative systems, the majority of experts agree that a system with high levels of politicization is less efficient, as most individuals do not have the chance to develop their full potential. The weaknesses of politicization are even more devastating in smaller states such as Slovenia, as they have a limited amount of human resources available. Based on a detailed analysis of the politicization of civil service in Slovenia, the authors can confirm that the level of politicization is quite high. After accession into the European Union (2004) and the adoption of austerity laws (2010-2013), politicization increased even further. Despite the formal existence of a meritocratic civil service system, politicians have an increasingly decisive role in the employment and advancement of civil servants, and total control over the appointment and dismissal of senior civil servants. The authors conclude that the predominance of politicians with relationships to senior civil servants can be changed with relatively simple adjustments to formal acts.

N2  - This article deals with the relationship between bureaucratic corruption and political corruption from the perspective of the industrial structure of a country. In so doing, we discuss whether political corruption and bureaucratic corruption can coexist. For this purpose, a suitable theoretical game model with imperfect information is constructed and solved. We demonstrate that the size of capital of a specific firm influences the decision of such firm to bribe the bureaucrat or lobby the government. Therefore, political and bureaucratic corruption are substitutes at the level of the firm because they depend on the capital of the firm, but they can coexist at a macro level. Some numerical experiments validate the theoretical model.

N2  - In Mexico there have been severe challenges to the modernization of the public school system and the implementation of much-needed reform. The backwardness of Mexico’s education sector has persisted into the twenty-first century. Public education has exhibited a jarring lack of transparency as monitoring and evaluation systems have, at least until recently, been extremely weak. The sector has displayed major teacher payroll irregularities, chronic teacher absenteeism, and patronage-based practices in teacher hiring and management. In 2014, The Economist reported that 13 percent of the teacher payroll - or 298, 000 teachers - did not show up for work. In the state of Nayarit, a local boss of the teachers” union and his family members simultaneously held positions as salaried classroom teachers, school principals, and district supervisors - and enjoyed a sizable income stream - without performing any of the duties that these positions entailed (del Valle 2014c). These types of practices have contributed to the low quality of public schools. National and international standardized tests show that Mexican public school students have not learned basic skills in reading, math, and science. Mexico had the lowest average score of all OECD countries in those subjects on the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). While socio-economic status heavily influenced these results (OECD 2013), the politicization of schools has surely also impacted achievement. The political clout of the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE) helps to account for the backwardness of public education and the inability of governments to enact significant changes in policy. Since the union was founded in 1943, SNTE has incrementally expanded its patrimonial power over the public school system. According to Max Weber, patrimonial power is a traditional form of domination in which a leader, who is not constrained by legal-rational rules, uses his or her official power to serve personal ends (Weber 1968). Embodying the concept of patrimonialism, union leaders exerted influence over the appointment of high-level officials in the education bureaucracy, placed union loyalists in significant administrative positions in schools, and influenced teacher hiring and promotion up the salary scale. Only in 2013, after the implementation of landmark education laws that reasserted the state’s authority over the education sector, were there signs that the union’s political power may have reached its limits.

N2  - Through an ethnographic focus on Muslim neighbourhoods in a North Indian city, this article traces the effects of increasing digitisation of Public Distribution Systems (PDS) and ID provision in India by examining the implications for relations between the state, low-level political actors and local populaces. The article explores the practice of sifarish (leaning on someone to get something done) which, it is argued, cannot be seen within simplistic rubrics of ‘corruption’ but instead comprises a socially embedded ethical continuum. With one of the stated aims of digitisation being the displacing of informal mediation, the ethnographic material illuminates the efforts of low-level political actors to navigate emerging digital infrastructures. Digitisation, however, does not end mediation and carries with it ideological, political and economic interests. This, the article argues, enables state/people spaces of mediation to be commodified and marketized and further cements processes of marginalisation experienced by India’s Muslim minority.

N2  - Recent protests in Iraq have brought focus to many issues currently affecting the Iraqi government's ability to govern. A source of some of these issues is the 2005 Constitution. The Constitution's biggest flaw is its ambiguity that has led to a confused political order whereby Iraq's political elite seek to interpret and take advantage of the Constitution for their personal benefits. Iraq's first Prime Minister, and the longest reigning since the 2003 Occupation, Nouri al-Maliki, was the first to exploit constitutional ambiguity and perhaps the most effective at it. Two questions arise to the issue of constitutional ambiguity and its exploitation by the Prime Minister. Where did the ambiguity in the Iraqi Constitution come from and how exactly was the constitution ambiguous? And how and through what processes did Nouri al-Maliki exploit ambiguities in the Iraqi Constitution? This paper will argue that constitutional ambiguity was (I) brought about by the rushed drafting of the 2005 Iraqi Constitution that saw American interference in the process result in an ambiguous document posing problems in four key areas, and (II) that the first Prime Minister who dealt with the Constitution, Nouri al-Maliki, exploited the Constitution through three distinct processes: co-opting the Judiciary, bypassing bureaucracy through patronage networks, and legitimising decisions that suited his own benefit using the Constitution as justification. This paper hopes to serve as a case study for the exploitation of constitutional ambiguity in post-occupation countries, where constitutional drafting was in one way or another flawed or mishandled; and a explanation as to how and through what processes constitutional ambiguity can be exploited by a country's executive leadership.

N2  - This paper reports findings from the first social cohesion survey in Hong Kong. Social cohesion is understood as a multi-dimensional concept, having a horizontal dimension which is concerned with both feelings and actions of members of society, and a vertical dimension that taps those between society and the government. It is found that horizontally, society feels cohesive but the feeling is not supported by corresponding behaviour such as participation in organizations and engagement in giving and helping. Vertically, society has much higher trust in bureaucracies of justice administration than the executive branch of the government. The level of civic engagement is respectable despite a general dissatisfaction with government performance. We conclude that however cohesively society feels, it is achieved with little institutional mediation and social engagement. We postulate that this is possible because lending support to advocacy groups, participation in small group activities and close family ties might have rendered institutional mediation less significant. © The China Quarterly, 2006.

N2  - In 1997, the Wood Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service concluded that a state of 'systemic and entrenched corruption' existed in the police organization. Major reforms were introduced in the wake of the Commission, including the appointment of a new Police Commissioner, organizational restructuring, a complete revamp of recruit education, as well as increased monitoring and accountability. The magnitude and scope of the Commission's reform programme was bold and ambitious by international standards. This article takes stock of the impact of the Commission 10 years after the publication of its Final Report. Drawing on interviews with key informants, official reports and other documentary sources, the article analyses the activities of the Commission, the intentions of its recommendations and the implementation and consequences of reform. The lessons of the NSW experience are salutary not only for understanding the vagaries of police reform, they also demonstrate the complex relationship between police organizations and the volatile political environments in which they increasingly need to operate.

N2  - The Ryukyu Kingdom was annexed by Meiji Japan in late 1879. Past scholarly works have focused on Li Hongzhang and the Zongli Yamen, the stewards of affairs relating to foreigners, in examining the Qing court’s responses to Japan’s annexation of its tributary state. By incorporating the latest arguments of Western and especially Chinese scholarship, this article investigates the attempts by He Ruzhang, China’s first minister to Japan, to reestablish Ryukyu’s tributary relationship with China and maintain Ryukyu’s independence. It reassesses the Ryukyu issue by contextualizing it in late Qing bureaucratic culture and institutional innovations. Although the Qing state’s system of appointments enabled He Ruzhang to serve as minister to Japan, factionalism, political rivalry, and a lack of coordination among the new institutions and personnel tasked to manage foreign affairs ultimately frustrated his attempts as a traditional scholar-official to uphold the Chinese tributary system.

N2  - In comparison with Western European bureaucracies the administrative system of the United States seems far removed from the Weberian ideal type. It appears to be a highly politicised structure in which its senior officers are personal appointees of the President who will resign as soon as the chief executive leaves office. The system therefore appears to have stagnated in the early nineteenth century and resembles, apart from its size, the pre-Northcote-Trevelyan bureaucracy of Britain. It is, however, often presumed that an advantage of this structure is that it ensures the obedience of the bureaucracy to the elected chief executive. These perceptions are misleading. The bureaucracy of the United States may be very different from those of Europe but it is also far removed from early-nineteenth-century patterns of patronage. The country has developed a bureaucratic system that is highly modern and efficient in the context of a system of government based on very different principles from European parliamentary systems that are founded on cohesive party structures. © 1990 J.E.

N2  - In Western countries, the grassroots NGO coalition plays a significant role in promoting the public expression of vulnerable communities. Grassroots NGO coalition has gradually become the leading actor of national policy advocacy by resources and scale of community members. However, China's grassroots NGOs coalition face many restrictions regarding organizational resources and political opportunities structure. Firstly, the grassroots NGOs relatively lack professionalism, funding, and other critical organizational resources. Secondly, the grassroots NGOs themselves and their coalition have difficulty obtaining legal status and have no institutional channels for policy expression. This unfavorable situation requires them to innovate 'alternative' strategies for public expression. The article finds that the grassroots NGO coalition of vulnerable communities has built up the political legitimacy of advocacy action by absorbing powerful social and political elites. It has also cooperated with international NGO to make up for the lack of internal and external resources, which also can expand the social impact and public attention on policy advocacy. Then, the grassroots NGO coalition selects the existing institutional channel for individuals as an intermediary to contacting government officials, submitting policy proposals. Meanwhile, the grassroots NGO coalition adopts professional elites to build the professionalism and social legitimacy of proposals. National policy advocacy also expands the political opportunities structure of local advocacy by promoting local citizens and grassroots NGOs to conduct social surveys, providing policy templates, and communicating with daily virtual communities. The changing structure offers the possibility for continuous advocacy action.

N2  - The Sierra Leone Police Force has its origins in British colonial administration. After Independence and with the consolidation of one-party rule the force slid into disrepute. The outbreak of civil conflict in 1991 largely decimated the force but the gradual restoration of peace provided an opportunity for police reform. This article covers the aspects of the political and institutional environment that helped engender change, as well as constraints faced by the reform agenda. It considers how the officers actually carried out the task at hand, and shares lessons as to what reform tactics worked and which were less successful. While several challenges remain, the reform programme has been largely successful, hinging on - among other factors - the appointment of a British Inspector General of Police; the availability of a core of reform-minded officers; long-term external technical and financial assistance; and a conducive political environment for change.

N2  - This paper charts the history and emergence of the 'senior police voice' within the UK. Before the 1990s, that voice was fragmented, hostile and contradictory. Cultural and political change plus a desire from within the senior echelons of the police service to professionalise began a long process of acceptance of the centrality of politics and the media within policing. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO, representing the senior ranks of the police service) in particular moved from the relative safety and anonymity of a 'private' organisation to a body, which was much more centre stage within criminal justice policy making. This paper analyses the development of a more corporate senior police voice through the Association's media activity and cultural change. It does this through an analysis of interviews with the members of ACPO, in particular its Presidents, who served as ACPO members from the late 1950s onwards.

N2  - Indigenous populations worldwide endure disparities in access to biomedical health care. This article suggests that institutional bureaucracy is an important and underexamined barrier to health care for indigenous Maya people in Guatemala. Based on interviews, participant observation, and seven years of experience with a non-governmental organization's patient advocacy program, we examine how biomedical institutions' administrative systems impede indigenous patients' abilities to obtain specialty medical treatments. Particularly, we examine the roles that street-level bureaucrats such as security guards and nurses play in restricting access to health care as well as how bureaucratic adherence to procedure can override clinical concerns in ways that actively harm patient health. We also highlight how indigenous Maya patients with limited Spanish language abilities and low literacy tend not to have the cultural capital to successfully navigate hospital environments. As such, bureaucracy in biomedical institutions replicates colonial and postcolonial social inequalities in ways that restrict access to care. Patient navigation is a valuable and urgently-needed service for Maya patients and a gap that could be filled by the numerous health service organizations operating in Guatemala.

N2  - This article attempts to understand state practices of restructuring of urban space and modes of governance, the role and strategies of the different actors involved and their participatory implications related to neoliberal urban transformation in Indian cities. Intergovernmental competition and inter-party conflict have constrained India's attempts towards state rescaling', marked by incomplete devolution of authority and resources to the cities. In contrast to decentralization, a new networked form of local governance restructures and shifts the authority and resources from the municipality to the private sector, civil society groups or other agencies or branches within governments. These forms have institutionalized highly insulated and discretionary processes of decision-making to serve interest and priorities of upper-and middle-class population. Powers of the municipal officials and elected representatives have been weakened. Such political discursive processes and practices have rendered urban poor and their interests invisible within transformative cities. All these necessitate grounded deeper evaluations of such policies that are celebrated as technically sound and efficient or promote good governance'.

N2  - Interest representation plays a significant role in policy-initiation and policy-making in the European Union (EU). Whether of corporatist or pluralist pattern, European interest activity is evident in all stages of European policy-making. A plethora of organized interests exist in the framework of European institutions with the aim of influencing European officials in the formation of European policy on their behalf. The diversity of interests with a stake at European sport is large. This article examines the emergence and activity of sport-related interest groups in the EU framework in terms of corporatist and pluralist representation. Following European institutional mobilization in the field of sport, various traditional and newly emerged organized sport interests have gained access to the EU policy-making mechanism and perform a variety of lobbying activities. The article argues that in the case of sport-related European policy-making, pluralism and corporatism coexist as patterns of interest representation.

N2  - When studying the formation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, scholars have usually focused on interest groups and electoral politics. This essay, by contrast, suggests that the reputation and network influences of an existing federal agency, the Bureau of Corporations, also shaped the creation of its successor, the FTC. Building on the concept of bureaucratic autonomy, the essay examines the structure of the bureau, its connections, and its preferences. The bureau's leaders favored a clear separation from the Department of Justice and argued for a quasi-judicial process for antitrust, which they felt would be more effective than the courts. They advocated discretion in covering small firms and mandatory annual reports, while seeking to avoid being assigned authority to clear business agreements in advance. Well before the 1914 debates, leaders at the bureau directed substantial funds toward influencing trust legislation. They contacted academics and civic leaders, tracked existing legislative proposals, and analyzed key legal terms. Internal studies examined major questions, such as how to define and regulate unfair trade practices. Bureau officials came to argue Congress could never define these in legislation. Instead a bureaucracy with appropriate authority could adapt definitions of unfair practices to changes in business. When the bureau became the nucleus of the FTC, it received much of the discretionary power it sought.

N2  - In China’s political selection system, officials capable of growing local economies are rewarded with promotions. Eager to demonstrate economic achievements, newly appointed local leaders may raise tax revenues to expand fiscal expenditures on infrastructure projects. Against this backdrop, we study how political appointments influence local firms’ tax planning. Based on a sample of locally administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs), we find that firms decrease their tax avoidance after new leaders take office. The political-turnover effect on these firms’ tax positions is more evident when the incoming leaders have more political clout over SOE managers, the incentives to divert resources are stronger, or politician-manager networks are present, and subsides following the launch of the anticorruption campaign. Furthermore, firms with higher post-turnover tax payments subsequently receive more government contracts or subsidies. Overall, our findings suggest political incentives shape the tax-planning activities of SOE managers in a ‘‘two-way favor exchange’’ manner. © 2021 American Accounting Association.

N2  - Against the backdrop of new research evidence suggesting breast screening causes avoidable harms and that women are not being given enough information to make informed decisions, we sought to explore the positions on breast screening adopted by a range of stakeholders and the coverage of this debate in the media. We sampled material from national newspapers, charity bodies' websites and official bodies' websites over a two-year period, and analysed this using thematic content analysis. Charities' and official bodies' positions were similar in that they were supportive of the NHS breast screening programme, and tended to defend it against its critics. They acknowledged, and partially explained the imperfect nature of breast screening but often omitted important information such as simple frequency statistics. There was a tendency for newspapers to cover the screening debate in an oblique way - presenting case studies of real' women and celebrities. These were mostly positive accounts of women who believed they had benefited from screening and supported the programme. Engagement with the debate in terms of discussion of the criticisms of the programme was lacking. The debate about breast cancer screening, and the increasing focus on its potential harms, received less coverage in the popular media than might have been expected. Interested stakeholder groups do make publicly available information about their positions on the relative value of screening, but these tend to focus on emphasising the potential benefits and less on the possible harms.

N2  - Air pollution control has been incorporated into the performance appraisal system of local officials in China. It is necessary to explore the underlying reasons behind China's air pollution. In this study, we measure the effects of different types of official turnover (OT) on air quality using a sharp regression discontinuity model, and collect the appointment information of mayors and municipal party secretaries from 333 cities in China between December 2013 and January 2018. Results show: (a) OT leads to a significant increase in air pollution discharges and this result remains valid after a series of robustness checks; (b) the level of air pollution increases when newly appointed officials are from the local district; (c) officials promoted from other districts tend to break the existing political connections and do not aggravate local air pollution; (d) when officials come from the central government, they often do not take any actions to control air pollution; (e) from the perspective of heterogeneity, we find that frequency of turnover, ex-officials, and the age, place of birth, and region of the officials have a heterogeneous impact on the officials' behavior. These findings shed new light on the determinants of air quality and suggest that OT is important in controlling air pollution. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - This paper explores how a government officer enacts "optimum" import policy when confronting lobbies on trade policies from both domestic and foreign firms in a transition economy. Two results are found: firstly, if the inducement from the foreign firm on the government officer works, then the optimum tariff is negative, that is, import subsidy. However, this subsidy will turn to a positive tariff rate with the increasing lobbying inducement from domestic firms. Secondly, zero tariff duty is not an optimum choice under most circumstances. Besides, an asymmetric result is that when these two firms' marginal costs are different, the optimum policy is to levy an import tariff on the one whose marginal cost is relatively small, while the other firm will get an import subsidy.

N2  - Performance measurement translates organizational goals into objectives and actions. Empirical performance information scores and ranks functional departments based on their implementation capacity; such capacity indexes can be linked to strategic planning and the adjustment thereof. Does the participation of various stakeholders in the strategic planning process enhance the use of performance information? Do external stakeholders generate a different effect on the use of performance information when compared to internal stakeholders? The author attempts to answer these questions by examining whether the participation of external stakeholders (including interest groups and citizen groups) and internal stakeholders (including Chief Administrative Officers {[}CAOs], local government staff, and elected officials) in strategic plans could positively influence the application of performance information to strategic planning. Data are mainly from the 2006 International City/County Management Association (ICMA) ``State of the Profession{''} survey. The statistical method of logistic regression was employed. The research findings indicate that the participation of CAOs, local government staff, and elected officials positively and significantly influences the application of performance information to strategic planning. Based on technical rationality, managerial effectiveness, and political accountability, internal stakeholders can generate a more significant effect on the use of performance information than external stakeholders.

N2  - There have been noteworthy changes in the ways in which the Chinese Communist Party assess, use, and manage its cadres under different historical conditions. Such changes are associated with the varying agendas for ruling China under the administrations headed by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping, respectively. This paper systematically examines pertinent official documents from the past four decades to reveal the role played by ideology in the CCP's cadre selection and management mechanism, as well as the resulting incentives and pressures for the Chinese cadres. Findings show that the reinforcing of political correctness through the finely designed Ideological Responsibility System (yisixingtai zerenzhi) effectively increases the cadres' loyalty to the central authority. However, there are also unintended and possibly negative implications with regard to some of the related changes.

N2  - Local governments in China operate within a hierarchical system of bureaucratic control in which each level of government has to be accountable to the next higher level, and provincial governments must accept the unified leadership of the State Council. The system is buttressed by the Party's nomenclatura system tightly controlling the appointments of officials at all levels. Local governments officials do not have to be answerable to voters, but they have to undergo detailed performance assessments annually by their superiors within the Party state. Local governments in China, assume a significant role in economic development. They own enterprises and also compete against each other, for example, they all try to attract more foreign investment. Chinese people are increasingly concerned with environmental pollution, food security, health care reforms, education reforms, etc. These are the new tests for local government leaders.

N2  - Using hand-collected data in China from 2001 to 2019, we examine how political uncertainty affects corporate political activities, including corporate corruption and corporate charitable donations, and whether the anti-corruption campaign moderates the relationship between political uncertainty and corporate political activities. First, we find that when city government officials change, local firms significantly increase corporate charitable donations while reducing corporate corruption. Second, the anti-corruption campaign strengthens the effects of political uncertainty on corporate political activities. Third, our results also show that political uncertainty has stronger effects 1) when new government officials come from external appointments, and 2) when former government officials experience abnormal turnover. In addition, the effects of political uncertainty on corporate charitable donations are stronger in non-state-owned enterprises and firms belonging to regulated industries. Finally, political uncertainty increases firms’ government subsidies through corporate political activities. It's clear that political activities have mediating effects. ©

N2  - The problems of the Secretary-General are as many as the number of member states of the United Nations. Although the UN Charter merely designates him or her “the chief administrative officer of the Organization” the position, as this volume has shown, is both much more and much less than that. In the vexed, and too often adversarial, relationship of the office to the members of the organization, the Secretary-General is sometimes treated as an errand boy and punching bag. This is partly the fault of short-sighted foreign offices, but also of the contradictions in the way the job is described in the Charter. That instrument seems to establish him or her as an important independent force, but also as a mere servant of the political organs of the organization. The problems that have afflicted the various incumbents mostly result from those contradictory designations. Yet this is not the only contradiction of the office. Quite apart from whether the Secretary-General is intended to be a secretary or a general, the appointment process is designed to avoid selecting either: It is a political rather than professional process, but one that is geared to choosing the weakest rather than the strongest candidate. This is not to disparage the various incumbents, but, as Brian E. Urquhart recounted in chapter 1, those who have stood tallest in the role have been those who most exceeded expectations. Even within the two dominant functions of the position, the Secretary-General frequently lacks sufficient internal authority to be an effective administrator of the organization, while also lacking the resources to exercise his or her external functions with credibility.

N2  - Hong Kong has been one of the early jurisdictions to adopt Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for delivering large public infrastructure projects. The development of this procurement approach in Hong Kong has followed an intricate path. As such, it is believed that there are a number of areas which are interesting to unveil. As part of a comprehensive research study looking at implementing PPPs, interviews with experienced local industrial practitioners from the public sector were conducted to realize their perspective on the topic of procuring public works projects. Amongst these interviews, fourteen were launched government officials and advisers. The interview findings show that the majority of the Hong Kong and Australian interviewees had previously conducted some kind of research in the field of PPP. Both groups of interviewees agreed that ``PPPs gain private sector's added efficiency/expertise/ management skills{''} when compared to projects procured traditionally. Also, both groups of interviewees felt that projects best suited to use PPP are those that have an ``Economic business case{''}. The interviewees believed that ``Contractor's performance{''} could be used as key performance indicators for PPP projects. A large number of critical success factors were identified by the interviewees for PPP projects; two of these were similar for both groups of interviewees. These included ``Project objectives well defined{''} and ``Partnership spirit/commitment/trust{''}. Finally it was found that in-house guidance materials were more common in the organizations of the Australian interviewees compared to the Hong Kong ones. This paper studies the views of the public sector towards the topic of PPPs in Hong Kong and Australia, which helps to answer some of the queries that both academics and the private sector in these jurisdictions are keen to know. As a result the private sector can be more prepared when negotiating with the public sector and realise their needs better, academics on the other hand are provided a wider perspective of this topic benefiting the research industry at large.

N2  - Political representation is experiencing an intellectual renaissance. A spate of new work (Manin 1997; Mansbridge 2003; Rehfeld 2006; Urbinati 2000, 2006; Urbinati and Warren 2008; Warren 2008; Williams 1998) has generated renewed interest in political representation-an idea that had been virtually silenced after Pitkin's (1967) masterful treatment of the subject in The Concept of Representation. In this paper we focus on political representation in electoral democracies and make one claim-that political representation may not be possible in the absence of a well-functioning and well-disciplined bureaucracy. We argue that a voter is represented by her elected representative when there is an institutionalized policy relationship between the state and the voter-or, a bureaucracy that fairly implements the political decisions authorized by voters. In states where the bureaucracy is corrupt, politicized, or virtually nonexistent, effective representation of voters' interests is unlikely. Political representation, therefore, requires not only a mechanism for electing representatives, but also parties whose organizations have mechanisms for advocacy of voters' interests, and a government that can successfully institutionalize voter interests once they are turned into laws or policies. Why are we focusing our attention only on political representation in representative democracies?2 We stress this particular relationship since free and fair elections are equated with representative democracy.3 If the claims in this chapter hold up, we may be faced with a distinctly uncomfortable theoretical possibility-that electoral democracy need not be repre-sentative. The first part of the paper isolates authorization, sympathy (either as advocacy and/or stand-in representation), and accountability as the three main features that define political representation. Formally (and consistent with the claims of polyarchy), voting is supposed to ensure such representation, especially authorization and accountability. If, however, we ask why a voter votes the way she does, we need to articulate what constitutes a sympathetic relationship between a voter and her representative. Such an articulation leads to the conclusion that minimal notions of democracy are not truly representative and, hence, devoid of any real political content. The de-velopment of this sympathetic relationship between the voter and her representative, we argue, is only possible when the interests of the represented to the representative are (effectively) institutionalized within the state. The second part of the chapter discusses the social cleavage theory of party systems. Only those social groups whose interests are institutionalized within a state can successfully be represented by a party system. In the third section we introduce, with thanks to Ahuja and Chhibber (2012), the notion of a capricious state-a state in which ad hoc and arbitrary policy implementation is the norm. A capricious state undermines political representation. We claim that in capricious states the norm is not political representation but selective political representation-a form of representation that results in a voter seeing the political process as representing someone elses interests, not hers. A capricious state severs the self-interested tie of a voter to her representative. The second part of the chapter discusses the social cleavage theory of party systems. Only those social groups whose interests are institutionalized within a state can successfully be represented by a party system. In the third section we introduce, with thanks to Ahuja and Chhibber (2012), the notion of a capricious state-a state in which ad hoc and arbitrary policy implementation is the norm.

We claim that in capricious states the norm is not political representation but selective political representation-a form of representation that results in a voter seeing the political process as representing someone elses interests, not hers. A capricious state severs the self-interested tie of a voter to her representative. The fourth section provides evidence from India where-despite fifty years of elections-a capricious state has undermined political representation. We provide evidence for the capricious state and show that these conditions lead citizens to see the state as selectively representative. Consequently, the links between social divisions and the party system are weak and fragile. We then provide evidence that where the bureaucracy is doing its job and parties are not the tools of individual politicians, political representation is possible. We also suggest a mechanism which may be responsible for the failure of many Indian politicians to discipline the bureaucracy and ensure the type of representation their voters demand. Finally, we conclude with some implications and caveats. Copyright © 2013 University of Pennsylvania Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - The Sustainable Development Goals have spurred a growing interest in and focus on equitable development. In theory, donors can play an important role in promoting equity within a country by providing services, influencing government policies and incorporating equity into decision-making. However, we know little about whether this actually happens on the ground. We conduct what we believe is the first study to explore the extent to which equity is prioritised in the allocation and distribution of aid, based on in-depth interviews with government officials, bilateral and international donors, and implementing partners operating in Northern Uganda. We find that a broad category of people are perceived to be marginalised/vulnerable, with a substantial segment largely untargeted by major donor programmes. Various stakeholders employ a wide range of strategies to identify the most vulnerable individuals and groups, including the use of available data and statistics, consultation and engagement with relevant stakeholders, and undertaking primary data collection. The strategies used to incorporate equity in aid allocation and distribution include: targeting the regions of Northern Uganda and Karamoja in particular, targeting both refugees and host populations in refugee-hosting districts, prioritising the critically vulnerable in any aid distribution process, and using specific tools and consultants to ensure that major equity issues are addressed in proposals. Challenges undermining the process include poor understanding of the concept of equity among some implementing partners, lack of comprehensively disaggregated data, corruption, and political interference in choice of aid location from government officials and donors.

N2  - This article examines the political and social networks that bound officials in the Qing bureaucracy and their role in concealing abuses and bribery, as well as the Yongzheng Emperors attempts to inculcate proper political behavior and bureaucratic accountability. The essay begins with a brief discussion of the state of affairs in Fujian and Taiwan under officials appointed by the Kangxi Emperor. It then turns to the Yongzheng Emperors efforts to revitalize what he perceived to be a moribund bureaucracy in the region through the pursuit of a case of corruption. The trial that resulted from a censors accusation revealed a complex web of patronage, manipulation, malfeasance, and mutual recrimination among officials and provides us a glimpse into the workings of Qing field administration under pressure from a reformist emperor. The corruption case in Taiwan was important to the emperor not on its own merits, but as an object lesson in proper political behavior and bureaucratic accountability. © 2013 Academy of East Asian Studies.

N2  - This article investigates how local political context—including civil society and political parties—influences the development of migrant care worker policies in Taiwan. This is particularly important in a national context where the government has actively utilized migrant care worker policies to solve the crisis in the social welfare sector. This article draws upon documentary analysis of policy debates on the proposed implementation of Long-Term Care Insurance and in-depth interviews with government officials, public service providers and non-governmental organizations to explore how the political alliances of political parties, social organizations, and interest groups affect policy outcomes. While current research focuses on the relationship between social welfare policies and the employment of migrant care workers, this article highlights the local political context and explores how political alliances have influenced the development of migrant care worker policies. This article argues that institutional path dependency and the strong policy alliance between the progressive party and social welfare organizations have stymied changes in migrant care worker policies and prevented Taiwan from further socializing the eldercare sector. © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the regional political regime on the example of Kemerovo Oblast. The article considers modern domestic and foreign typologies of political regimes, their correspondence to the realities of Russian regions. The practice of actual gubernatorial control over the arrangement of the main political and economic regional players in Kuzbass does not allow us to speak about the balance of branches of power in the region. The author, in his analysis of the problems of the regional political regime, relies on a neoinstitutional methodology. Studies of regional political regimes presuppose reliance on verifiable methods of analysing socio-economic and political processes in the region that allow us to identify the unique architecture of the regional political regime. At the same time, it is difficult to count on success, basing only on statistical and empirical materials. For success, it is necessary to keep political processes that partially overlap a particular region, take into account national political trends and perspectives that inevitably affect the perception and evaluation of local regional processes. The political order in most of Russia's regions is characterised by the prevalence of policy over economy. Institutional processes here are regulated mainly by informal conventions. In Kuzbass, power and property constitute an indivisible institution. Features of the regional regime in these conditions are: the phenomenon of ``power - property''; redistribution type of economy; class model of stratification; orientation to the preservation of socio-political processes, and not to the innovative development of the region. The relationship between power and property is built around the theory of the administrative market with the dominant role of the regional bureaucracy. In Kuzbass, the formation of a free competitive market was not completed, and interest groups form a system of inequalities by the criterion of the opportunities for rental access, determined by the attitude of the first person (the governor). Stratification is of a cast-paternal, closed character, and is a derivative of the degree of possession of imperious resources. The regional political regime assumes the architecture of power on the basis of the ``power - property'' relationship and the formation of the ruling elite uncontrolled from civil society. Kuzbass business for many years mostly avoided solidarisation, preferring backstage arrangements with the governor of Kuzbass and his clientele. The boundaries and opportunities for regional cliques in the adoption and implementation of political (state) decisions are primarily determined by their links with informal and formal institutions of power; the personal composition of participants in these entities; compliance of resources and objectives of these associations with the regulatory restrictions existing in the state. The results of their activities can be judged by indirect data and, above all, by the results of the distribution of tangible and intangible resources in society, demonstrating the true beneficiaries of regional management. In Kemerovo Oblast, due to the poor quality of institutions, the apathy of the population, the weakness of civil society and the lack of control of the ruling elite, shadow structures (cliques, clientele, clans) currently have a decisive influence in approving regional policy goals and making key management decisions.

N2  - This paper investigates how firms' political capabilities and countries' political structures affect firms' lobbying decision. We use a cross-country, firm-level dataset that covers more than 22,013 firms in 46 countries to discover that a firm's individual- and collective-level political capabilities are positively associated with lobbying. In contrast, the degree of checks and balances among bureaucrats in a country's political market is negatively associated with the firm's possibility of lobbying. Finally, we also find that the positive role of a firm's political capabilities in lobbying is mitigated by the degree of checks and balances among bureaucrats. This study contributes to the literature of corporate political activities by filling the research gaps (1) as considering both horizontal and vertical checks and balances among bureaucrats in political markets, and (2) as simultaneously considering firms' individual and collective political capabilities, by taking one more conceptual step on the literature of contingent dynamic capabilities and lobbying.

The study focused on the promotion and transfer of police officers in 2010. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Data were collected from documents, in-depth interviews, and attitude surveys. The survey included 1,319 police officers, ranging in rank from Commander to Squad Leader. It was found that political involvement in making transfers and promotions mainly affected police commissioned officers. The rules and regulations for promotions and transfers of officers were overall considered to be very fair. However, there were other aspects considered to be less fair. It was also found that politicians and other outside influential figures, as well as nepotism, played a role by interfering in the procedures for promotion and transfer of police officers. It is recommended that related legislation is amended. Ranks should be abolished and only position titles should be used.

N2  - When a nation reforms its educational system, its educational administration system must also transform. For example, Education Act 1944 in Great Britain replaced the Board of Education with the Ministry of Education. A similar change in the educational system occurred in late-Qing China. Qing Dynasty established a modern Western-style educational system in 1904, the Gui-mao school system, which borrowed from the Japanese educational system. Before 1904, China had a three-tier administrative system for governing traditional schools and academies at the central, provincial, and local levels. The educational commissioner of each province, nominated by the throne every 3 years, supervised all government schools in the prefectures and counties and managed examinations for admissions and the selection of qualified candidates for the civil service examination. Although their rank and status were lower than those of governors-general, they had the power to monitor and impeach governors-general as a mechanics of checks and balances. The officials from the old system continued their work under the new school system introduced in 1904. The civil service examination was abolished in 1905, and the Ministry of Education was established at the same year. The duties and power of the previous educational commissioners were shared with the governors-general or governors. Thus, power disputes and conflicts gradually emerged, and the ranking of educational commissioners became problematic.In response, the government reconstructed the provincial administration system in the education department. This topic warrants investigation, but most books have only explored the history of the educational administration system in modern China and the new Ministry of Education from a general perspective. Some journal articles have analyzed changes in the roles of educational commissioners and the directors of education and their educational visits to Japan. However, few studies have analyzed the reconstruction of the educational administration system from the perspective of necessity at the middle (provincial) level of government or the power conflicts between the state and provinces. This article explores the reconstruction of the provincial administration system in the education department between 1904 and 1911 through a historical method and investigation of sources of internal and external criticism. The author mainly used primary sources and official documents such as the Ministry of Education Gazette, A Collection of Reports and Orders of Ministry of Education, a collection of educational codes and regulations, works by key reform figures, newspapers, and journals. This article consists of six parts: an introduction, a description of the system before the reform, a list of causes and motivations for the reform, a description of the terms and nomination of new directors of education and their power relations with other officials, an analysis of unsolved disputes, and the conclusion. In 1904, key educational reformer, Governor-General Chi-Tung Chang, proposed a plan to establish a provincial education office controlled by the governor-general as a part of guidelines for educational reform. The new education offices were in charge of all new Western-style schools and paralleled the previous educational commissioner system. Therefore, a dual-track system of educational administration was temporarily established in the provinces. Thus, some provinces, such as Chili, Kiangsi, and Chekiang, followed the approach of Hubei Province, and others kept the old system. From 1904 to 1906, senior officials proposed seven reform initiatives to resolve contradictions and conflicts between the old and new systems: (1) retaining the educational commissioners but changing their terms to enable them to coexist with provincial education offices and share power with the governors-general, (2) abolishing the educational commissioner system and allowing the provincial education office to manage education, (3) replacing the educational commissioners with superintendents, as in Japan, (4) abolishing the provincial education office but retaining the educational commissioners and adjusting their duties and qualifications, (5) abolishing the educational commissioners and renominating the educational inspectors under the control of the governors-general, (6) abolishing the educational commissioners altogether, and (7) appointing a new director of education under the governor-general’s control to replace the educational commissioner. These proposals reflected the ideas and interests of the ministers of education and governors-general; all these proposals intended to control education in the provinces. The last initiative was adopted, and a director of education and an education office were established for each province. The directors’ rank was low, and they were under the governor-general’s control but could be nominated and evaluated by the ministers of education, resulting in a compromise. However, this reconstruction of the provincial organization system changed the power relationsin the education system between the state and provinces considerably. Power disputes and conflicts, including those between the central and provincial governments, those between the director of education and governors-general, those among the directorof education, governors-general, and the Ministry of Education, and those between the director of education and other ministries, gradually emerged. The appointment of the director of education was the most notable change among the seven initiatives because it required the reallocation of abolished educational commissioners, their staff, and financial resources for education in the provinces. These problems created substantial challenges for the new director of education. In addition, the Qing government reorganized its provincial administration of the education department. As a result, three critical problems arose. The first problem was the necessity of the provincial administration of the education system and whether it should have been a provisional or permanent agency. The second problem was determining to whom power over education in the provinces should belong: either ruled by the governors-general or governors, or ruled by the ministers of education. The third problem was determining whether the nature of educational administration system and provincial agencies would be general or professional administration; this resulted in a dual leadership system inthe provinces. The power disputes between the provinces and state have remained unsolved from the establishment of the Republic China in 1912 until the present. Therefore, the reconstruction of the provincial administration system in the education department of late-Qing China should be investigated to benefit educational reformers.

N2  - Social welfare remains the most important objective of governments of all the countries despite the economic growth. Government spends huge funds in welfare schemes each year for the benefits of public at large. The welfare schemes include poverty alleviation, improvement in sanitation, educating girl child, employment creation, eliminating social evils, providing safe drinking water etc. Despite spending huge amount of money, government is unable to achieve the required objectives. There are many reasons for the same. Lack of accountability on part of government officials, Red tapism, and corruption, lobbying of government officials are some of the reasons poses hurdle in effective implementation and achieving desirable results out of public sector spending. Moreover the social objectives are not outcome based and they are just confined to accomplish a given task. Government officials lack incentives for effective implementation of such schemes. Due to the inherent weakness in the social system, social impact bonds came into play. The first SIB was launched in UK by Social Finance Ltd. in September 2010. Since then, government of many countries including US, Canada, India, Israel, Ireland is exploring use of social impact bonds. This paper attempts to explain the conceptual framework of social impact bonds and its adoption by various countries like UK, US, India and Israel in social welfare programs for the benefits of various social groups.

N2  - Armed forces are currently in the environment with moral ambiguity and multiple cultures. In face of the chaos, corruption, and wasteful trend in current social value system, continuous conflict is bothering the cultivation and atmosphere of military character. Under the situation, officers and soldiers could easily fall into bad belief and become indifferent to surrounding affairs with apathy. Various military discipline events appear in domestic armed forces in past years; besides, the exaggeration and report of print media and electronic media, and even some officers and soldiers spilling, smearing, and slandering each other to defile others’ innocence destroy the image of armed forces. Military character presents close relations with integrity building action. Aiming at military personnel in Ministry of National Defense, total 420 copies of questionnaire are distributed, and 347 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 83%. The research results are summarized as below. Factors in the effectiveness of armed forces personnel’s anti-corruption governance contain micro aspects of lack of legal and disciplinary ideas and value deviation of armed forces personnel as well as macro aspect of complicated approval operation and rules resulting in lobbying interfering businesses. The effectiveness of armed forces personnel’s anti-corruption governance not being affirmed by the society is related to the engagement of supervisors at all levels in anti-corruption work, as armed forces personnel are restricted to the political environment and aging senior customs personnel that the director’s engagement in anti-corruption work is not manifested. Armed forces personnel involving in internal anti-corruption problems are minimized to largely reduce the effectiveness of anti-corruption governance. According to the results, suggestions are proposed, expecting to improve problems resulted from military discipline and to promote the armed forces’ image of integrity, being close to the people, and loving the people.

N2  - This article of top civil servants in Danish central and local government sheds new light on politicization. A survival analysis shows that since 1970, the risk that a top civil servant will be replaced has increased. There is no evidence of politicization in central government while city managers' risk of replacement increases both when a new mayor, representing another party and holding an absolute majority, and when the shift of mayor takes place within the same party. We interpret these results as evidence of the adaptability of the merit civil service and political executives' stronger insistence on their authority to make discretionary replacements. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - The interaction between political executives and civil servants rests on
a delicate balance between political responsiveness and the duty of
civil servants and ministers to respect legal and other normative
constraints on executive authority. In Danish central government, this
balance is stressed by norms that define the correct behavior when the
civil service provides ministers with political advice and assistance.
Organizational factors strongly influence civil servants' behavior when
they have to balance responsiveness against constraints on their role as
political advisers. Moreover, civil servants working closely with
ministers pay more attention to legal constraints than their peers among
agency officials and specialists. Agency officials and specialists are
much more prone to prioritize professional standards. We argue that this
pattern can be generalized West European systems.

N2  - The use of politically appointed ministerial advisors has increased noticeably in many Western countries, but we know little about how this development has affected the civil servants recruited on merit. The article asks whether political appointees accentuate or blur the line between politics and administration. Do political appointees take over political-tactical advice and leave policy advice to the permanent civil service, or do they cause permanent civil servants to be even more influenced by political considerations? And do political appointees make it easier or more difficult for the permanent civil service to be politically responsive? A Most Similar Systems Design comparison of Denmark and Sweden allows an assessment of the effects of political appointees. It is found that a large number of political appointees decreases functional politicisation of the permanent civil service; that functional politicisation tends to crowd out tasks related to more classic policy advice; and that functional politicisation increases political responsiveness. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - The Internet won’t save itself. And no single organization can save it either. That is why everything OpenMedia does is about placing citizens at the heart of digital policy. Our digital future is just too important to be left to industry lobbyists and government bureaucrats. OpenMedia engages, educates, and empowers people through long-term citizen-driven campaigns. For this, it is important to ensure that citizen voices are at the heart of the debate. We ensure citizens can have their say through accessible online actions, innovative participatory tools, and through Internet Town Halls and other events. Having gathered citizen input, we do our utmost to make sure those voices are heard at the heart of government. We do so by appearing at regulatory proceedings, meeting with politicians, creating online tools that make it easy for citizens to take part in regulatory processes, and by leveraging media coverage to encourage decision-makers to listen to citizens. Working with Canadians, OpenMedia has developed crowd-sourced, informed, in-depth research that shapes our policy plans. This approach is having a real impact and has led to a significant improvement in recent years in terms of how the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) listens to Canadians. © 2016 Fordham University Press.

N2  - The U.S. Constitution explicitly provides the President with two methods of appointing officers of the United States. First, the Appointments Clause provides the President with the authority to make appointments with the advice and consent of the Senate. Specifically, Article II, Section 2, clause 2 states that the President "shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law." Second, the Recess Appointments Clause authorizes the President to make temporary appointments unilaterally during periods when the Senate is not in session. Article II, Section 2, clause 3 provides: "The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session." While the Recess Appointments Clause enables the continuity of government operations, Presidents, on occasion, have exercised authority difficulty securing Senate confirmation. The Recess Appointments Clause is not without its ambiguities, and the President's use of this power in light of these ambiguities has given rise to significant political and legal controversy since the beginning of the republic. This report provides an overview of the Recess Appointments Clause, exploring its historical application and legal interpretation by the executive branch, the courts, and the Comptroller General. It also reflects the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision in Noel Canning v. Nat'l Labor Relations Board, which held that the President's three recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on January 4, 2012, were invalid. Furthermore, congressional legislation designed to prevent the President's overuse or misuse of the Clause is also explored.

N2  - The human resources management in state agencies based on modern technologies is an indicator of effective development of the national management system. Results of reforms in personnel policy depend on keeping track of the effectiveness of previously used methods. The article reviews historical experience of human recourses management in the Russian gubernia bodies in the 19th century drawing on documents from the national archives: the State Archive of Russian Federation and two regional archives (the Archive of the Kursk Region and the Archive of the Voronezh Region). Comparative and chronological analysis identifies features and trends of the human resources management. Official acts of gubernia workflow, central authorities' instructions on human resources, and officials' curriculum vitae provide scientific data. Analysis of management documents allows to identify peculiarities of gubernia officials' careers. Participation of central authorities in the development of human resources in the gubernias is also demonstrated. The research reveals that in the 19th century human resources management activities of the Rugovernment human resources management and also provide scientific material, which can be used to justify modernization of human recourses and workflow management.ssian government aimed to retain the personnel in the gubernias. Governor influenced the manning of gubernia offices; processed and referred to the government departments the human resources documents petitioning benefits. Authorities supervised moral character of officials by instructions on administrative ethics and regulations of on-duty behavior. The results of the work enhance our understanding of consistent patterns in operating of the national institutes and establishment of documentation of the government human resources management and also provide scientific material, which can be used to justify modernization of human recourses and workflow management.

N2  - This paper aims to rethink whether the solution to the politization of the Latin American managerial levels in the public sector is always to try to establish contests based on merit for all appoitments. Comparative evidence in the region shows that seeking to completely eliminate political appointments can be counterproductive since the political reaction is so massive that no appointments are made based on merit. This argument is illustrated with the Argentine case in light of the experiences of both the cases of Chile and Peru, which were able to improve their civil services including the p olitical component in their processes. In Argentina, despite the existence of norms that force the creation of an open, meritocratic and competitive selection system for the managerial levels -since its approval in 2008- nothing happened. Maybe it is necessary to rethink the role of politics, but not only from its negative consecuences, but also as a way to allow the so needed reforms. Political appointments can be a part of the process of selection of top managerial positions in an organized and monitored way, as both the cases of Peru and Chile show.

N2  - The tension between merit-based and discretionary appointments is a constant challenge to civil service reform in Latin America. However, studies of the politicization of public employment do not tend to analyze the changes to the structure of the state apparatus as a strategy to incorporate public officials on the basis of discretionary appointments. Indeed, it is often noted that there are many ways of avoiding merit-based entry, though there is scarce empirical evidence about what these are and how they vary over time. To begin to fill this gap, this paper presents the influence of changes in the organizational structures of the state in the increase in discretionary appointments to the state apparatus. To do this, it examines the case of Argentina between the years 2003 and 2016.

N2  - Muftis are the religious and legal experts in the Muslim societies. One of their main functions was to issue legal opinion and thereby influence the decisions of the judges and political authorities. They served as such in the Ottoman Empire. The judges generally concluded the cases in the light of fatwas. In other words, muftis were important figures in the Ottoman religious and legal system. For this reason, it is important to find out their appointment and dismissal procedure to their official posts. This article outlines the historical background and the qualifications of the Muftis. Afterwards, it analyses their appointment and dismissal decrees recorded by the judges in their law court registers which have been preserved at the St. St Cyril and Methodius National library of Bulgaria.

N2  - The populist spirit animates the current era in American politics. Soured on pluralism, voters are voicing anger and resentment at how representative democracy is working. Populism divides the political world into Us, the People, and Them, the professional politicians and bureaucrats who actually rule. 1 Deeply suspicious of the politics of compromise, the populist’s constant fear is that They will betray Us. The populist indictment is that those whom we elect (and reelect) to represent us abuse this trust and serve the privileged and the special interests instead. Today’s cast of villains thus includes not just elected officiais but the lobbyists, political consultants, political action committees, and media experts who influence them. More generally, the populist outlook is hostile to any institution, including the political party, that impedes direct communication between citizens and decisionmakers. © 1996 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Considerable attention has been given to the independence of auditors-general in the literature. However, there are other officers of parliament who also have roles that may require protection from the excessive use of power by the executive arm of government. In response to the recent Public Accounts and Estimates Committee Inquiry into a Legislative Framework for Victorian Statutory Officers of Parliament, the study compares the enabling legislation of four Victorian officers of parliament in terms of their powers, independence, funding and mandate as well as the accountability mechanisms available to parliament in terms of their appointment, tenure and oversight. The four officers are: the auditor-general; the ombudsman; the regulator-general; and the director of public prosecutions. A number of notable differences in the enabling legislation are identified and reform options for strengthening such legislation are presented.

N2  - NGO involvement in the world of refugee affairs is taken as given in the 1950 UN Statute establishing the UNHCR. The UNHCR is to establish contact with NGOs and facilitate their coordination. The origins of the Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR) lie in this “coordination” mandate. Since UNHCR's 1994 “Parinac” global conference with NGOs, NGOs have been acknowledged as partners in protection – that is – ensuring refugees can enjoy their entitlements (see the late Arthur Helton's definition of protection in Problems of Protection (Routledge, 2004), 19). This includes their rights under the 1951 Convention, human rights treaties and national law. When the Canadian Council for Refugees meets, its Working Group on Protection will hear reports from members from each region of Canada on issues with status determination, border issues and detention issues. The meeting will agree on actions to take. Basically, this is how the UNHCR does protection. I hope the UNHCR is proud of the results of its early mandate coordination of NGOs. This chapter will talk about one kind of NGO involved in protection by what is called “advocacy.” Advocacy is the package of activity which tries to give protection. There are two avenues – legal, through courts and judges, and persuasion, through law makers and government officials. Both of these can be usefully extended to international arenas, the UN or regional bodies and the UN or regional human rights complaint mechanisms. © Cambridge University Press.

N2  - Government agencies service interest groups, advocate policies, provide advice to elected officials, and create and implement public policy. Scholars have advanced theories to explain the role of agencies in American politics, but efforts to test these theories are hampered by the inability to systematically measure agency preferences. We present a method for measuring agency ideology that yields ideal point estimates of individual bureaucrats and agencies that are directly comparable with those of other political actors. These estimates produce insights into the nature of the bureaucratic state and provide traction on a host of questions about American politics. We discuss what these estimates reveal about the political environment of bureaucracy and their potential for testing theories of political institutions. We demonstrate their utility by testing key propositions from Gailmard and Patty's (2007) influential model of political control and endogenous expertise development.

N2  - This article examines the inner workings of a private company's participation in the European policy game. The qualitative analysis shows that the promotion of a company's interests and its positioning at the level of the European Union is not self-evident and results from internal battles in which European public affairs employees play a pivotal role. Under what conditions do the European public affairs employees of a leading multinational firm endorse, manage, and promote an active position in the Brussels' polity sphere? This article highlights the process by which these `professionals of Europe' adapt to the specific requirements of the EU and mobilise an informal network to contribute to European policy-making. These lobbyists appear as `double entrepreneurs': as entrepreneurs on behalf of both their employers' interests and the European cause as they place themselves as the auxiliaries of EU civil servants. Maintaining a delicate balance, interest representatives occupy a position of dependence, both on their employer and on the polity field in which they valorise their `European institutional capital'. This position allows these social agents to serve as a broker between their employer and the European arena. In doing so, they nurture the porosity between (economic) interests and the public sector, which cuts across the field of `Eurocracy'.

N2  - We tend to overlook the linkages between how policy coordination within bureaucracy is achieved and the nontrivial implications of policy coordination for business power over the policy process. This article addresses this gap by exploring macroprudential regulatory governance in Turkey. Drawing on elite interviews and written sources, the article argues that analytically and operationally more capable and politically endorsed central bank subordinated the autonomous bank regulator, as the latter assumed a de facto regulatory intermediary role between the former and the regulatee. Within this setting, the regulatee could not rely on its structural and institutional power for mobilization of instrumental power to contest and overturn macroprudential measures. The article contributes to our understanding of the conditions of policy coordination within bureaucracy, how de jure regulator could be subordinated as a de facto regulatory intermediary, and why influential business power needs both a politically and bureaucratically enabling setting.

N2  - This article examines the problematic nature associated with the appointment of head teachers in Ghanaian senior high schools (SHS) and how this is impacting the governance of schools. The Ghana Education Service (GES) is supposed to make appointments and promotions of head teachers, however there are external bodies that influence the appointment process. With data gathered from deputy head teachers, education officers, and senior teachers from selected schools, the study examined the problematic nature of head teacher appointment and the nature of school governance. The results showed that although the GES is making efforts to promote good governance through the school leadership, there are still some controversies and challenges that affect the effectiveness of their work. To address this, the study concludes that, the GES must streamline its appointments and promotion guidelines so as to eliminate any external pressures and influences to promote improvement and ensure continuity.

N2  - This chapter bridges cultural and political approaches to determine why elite support for movement claims may be inconsistent across the policy process. I analyze this question empirically through 16 in-depth interviews with government officials in two regions of Peru: Arequipa and Cusco. Regional officials appraised feminist advocacy in two opposing ways. First, they valued feminist advocates' contributions to policy processes, which enabled them to advance reproductive rights and gender equity initiatives. They also perceived women as a group deserving of these initiatives and framed gender policies in terms of rights and equality. Second, they were critical of feminist advocates' weaknesses in mobilizing support, which hindered the officials' own ability to advance reproductive rights and gender equity initiatives. Furthermore, regional officials understood reproductive rights and gender equality to be thwarted by the State's economic instrumentalism and by Catholic Church's ultraconservatism. This research shows how a cultural approach to policy elites' support for movement claims goes beyond their individual attitudes and calculations to capture their perceptions, frames, and understandings tied to the broader cultural context. This wider conceptualization in turn helps clarify inconsistencies in policy elites' support for movement claims across the policy process. © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

N2  - This article investigates the revolving doors phenomenon in the European Union (EU). It proposes a management approach that treats this phenomenon as a form of corporate political activity through which companies try to gain access to decision makers. By using sequence analysis to examine the career paths of almost 300 EU affairs managers based in public and private companies across 26 countries, three different ideal-typical managers are identified: those EU affairs managers coming from EU institutions and public affairs; those who make a career through the private sector; and those who establish themselves in national political institutions. This identification confirms that EU institutions need different types of information and companies need EU affairs managers with different professional backgrounds able to provide it. Rather than observing a revolving door of EU officials into EU government affairs, what the authors term ‘sliding doors’ – namely the separation of careers, especially between the public and private sectors – is discerned.

N2  - In Deuteronomy 16:18-20, Moses instructs the people of Israel to appoint judges and officials in their various towns upon entering the Promised Land. Strikingly, not much is said about the qualifications of these judges and officials, or the method of their appointment. Rather, the passage is devoted to what these judges and officials were, and were not to do, and also what the community's share in justice was to be. Despite the emphasis in the passage on the principles the community and its judges and officials were to embody, no comprehensive study has been published that relates what exactly was expected of both parties when it comes to justice. The primary objective of the current article was to investigate what principles these judges and officials were to embody, and what was expected of the community when it came to justice. The secondary objective was to give some suggestions on how these principles can be applied to modern citizens and judiciaries. This article investigates the possible literary, historical and canonical context of the passage by means of a detailed literature study and an independent exegetical study. Making use of these findings, the principles underlying justice in the passage were deduced. This article revealed that the appointment of judges and officials was the task of the whole community; that judges and officials were to judge fairly; that the community had to appoint judges and officials who were wise; that the appointment of judges and officials was for the whole community; that the pursuit of justice were to be the aim of everyone and that the blessing of the Lord would ensue where justice prevails. In conclusion some suggestions were given on how these principles can be applied to modern citizens and judiciaries, briefly reflecting on judicial progress and challenges in South Africa. Contribution: This article therefore contributed to the discussion of the Old Testament in Africa. It argued that one possibility of meeting the challenges and setbacks of the South African judiciaries is to (once more) emphasise the principles deduced from Deuteronomy 16:18-20 to the country's citizens and judiciaries. The (re)implementation of these principles by the Rainbow Nation could ensure that justice is served by everyone and for everyone.

N2  - This article discusses the influence of environmental law on the environment and the economy. Businesses seek to influence the stringency and design of environmental law by lobbying legislators and officials at environmental agencies. Sometimes business groups play a formal, collaborative role in the development of environmental regulations. The basic types of regulatory design for environment are presented. Environmental law can affect underlying environmental conditions and other policy criteria. The global reach of business in today's economy, combined with the global scope of some of the most salient environmental problems, increasingly creates new challenges for business and environmental law. One set of challenges centers on the complexity of the legal environment within which multinational corporations and other businesses engaged in global transactions must operate. The global nature of some of the most pressing environmental problems has created a related set of challenges linked with achieving international cooperation and coordination.

N2  - Judge Merrick Garland's thwarted Supreme Court nomination has divided legal scholars over the meaning of the Appointments Clause. While some believe that the Senate and the President share the power to appoint principal officers, others contend that the President alone has the power to nominate and appoint them. To the former scholars, Article II, Section 2, enables the President to nominate whomever he or she wishes, but it also empowers the Senate to confirm or reject whomever it wishes. Accordingly, the appointment power is divided between the two, meaning it is only exercised when both branches utilize their respective and discretionary powers. To the latter scholars, the same text gives the President the sole power to nominate and to appoint, with appointment subject to the Senate's mandatory duty to advise and decide on whether to consent. Therefore, advice and consent is a check by which the Senate prevents the President from abusing his or her appointment power, triggered by the President's decision to nominate. This Note argues that the latter scholars are correct because the Founders' intent, the Constitution's text, the doctrines of separation of powers and checks and balances, and long-standing Senate practice indicate that the appointment power is solely a presidential power. For Judge Garland, this conclusion means the Senate violated its duty to hold hearings and to provide an opportunity for a vote on his nomination. More importantly for the nation, it means that the Appointments Clause requires the Senate to apply to every nominee the process that it has designed for securing its consent. Thus, the precedent established by the 114th Senate of blocking all Supreme Court nominations during presidential election years, which will likely be followed and perhaps extended to mid-term election years, contravenes the nation's fundamental constitutional structure. By failing to perform its duty, moreover, the 114th Senate also deprived the nation of the benefits that the advice and consent process provides, such as greater accountability for the Senate's confirmation or rejection of nominations and a more functional government. In doing so, the Senate has placed political expediency ahead of the public interest.

N2  - Policy entrepreneurs are individuals who exploit an opportunity in order to influence political results for their own benefit. We use the policy entrepreneurship literature as a theoretical lens for understanding how local players in the policy arena can use a national security agenda in order to promote an energy policy they desire. Using a case study approach, we explain how an Israeli electric vehicle company, Better Place, identified Israel's acute national security priority to cut its dependence on oil and leveraged it, along with environmental arguments, to make the case for their approach to transportation. Our analysis also demonstrates how policy entrepreneurs collaborate with Israeli bureaucrats, senior politicians and lobbying groups to create a national shift toward electric cars. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Can the entry of a policy entrepreneur challenge the equilibrium of a policy network and promote changes that might clash with the goals of powerful civil-servants and/or interest groups and, if so, why and how? Our goal is to examine two sides of the same coin: how does an in-depth analysis of Israel's dental care reform enrich our understanding of policy networks and policy entrepreneurship? Second, how does the literature on policy networks and policy entrepreneurship help us understand this reform? Based on a theoretical framework that appears in the literature of policy entrepreneurship and policy networks, we analyze the motivations, goals and strategies of the main actors involved in the process of reforming pediatric dental care in Israel. We demonstrate how a policy entrepreneur navigated within a policy network and managed to promote a reform that, until his appearance, no one else in that network had succeeded in enacting. Methods: Our goals are advanced through a case study of a reform in pediatric dentistry implemented in Israel in 2010. It rests on textual analyses of the literature, reports, committee minutes, parliamentary proceedings, print and online media, and updates in relevant legislation and case law between 2009 and 2015. In addition, the case study draws on the insights of one of the authors (TH), who played a role in the reform process. Results: Historical circumstances and the Israeli public's longstanding lack of interest in changing the existing model as well as interest groups that preferred the dominance of the private sector in the dental healthcare system kept that area out of the services supplied, universally, under the National Health Insurance Law. This situation changed significantly following the publication in 2007 of a policy analysis that contributed to shifts in the motivations and balance of power within the policy network, which in turn prepared the ground for a policy change. In this environment a determined policy entrepreneur, who identified a window of opportunity, took the lead and instituted an innovative and far-reaching reform. Conclusions: A policy entrepreneur can leverage external factors as well as the previous activities of a policy network that has already matured to create a policy change. Such entrepreneurial activity includes maneuvering around opponents and overcoming resistance from various stakeholders.

N2  - Although we have fairly good knowledge of the impact of official bilingualism at the federal level and of official unilingualism in Quebec on language practice in government, we know less about whether these changes in language policies have led to shifts in language practice in civil-society organizations. The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism carried out an extensive investigation of language practices in the private sector and in voluntary associations. Using the royal commission's work on associations representing the general interests of business, this article examines language practices of these associations three decades after the royal commission's studies were published. The authors argue that the cordiality found between French and English in general business associations in the late 1960s continues to be the rule in these types of associations today. This cordiality, however, is rooted in a change in linguistic relations. Federal-level associations tend to have accommodated institutional bilingualism but retain English as their language of work. Quebec-based associations have moved to conform to official unilingualism. Moreover, the number of non-francophones in positions of authority in the Quebec groups has diminished, with executive structures now being dominated by francophones.

N2  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play an important role in the representation of citizens' interests towards policymakers. However, they increasingly run their campaigns not only against policymakers, but also against corporations. While the choice among strategies has been examined either in the state (targeting policymakers) or in the market (targeting companies), the choice between the two remains unexamined. Moreover, conventional studies of advocacy have failed to comparatively assess how groups combine strategies. This study fills these gaps, examining when NGOs target their campaigns at (a) the market, (b) the state and (c) both. It examines 24 NGO campaigns in the UK and Italy using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Three main findings emerge. First, structural factors-especially the openness of the market-are most important in determining which target an NGO chooses. Second, campaigns that combine strategies tend to be either market-or state-oriented. Finally, high resources are the factor that pushes NGOs to combine strategies across the market and the state.

N2  - This article examines the development and early politics of the Dalit Panther Iyakkam (DPI), or Dalit Panther Movement, of Tamil Nadu, India. Established in 1982, the DPI advanced a political programme that petitioned state authorities qua democratic citizens. By submitting written appeals through formal institutional channels, DPI organisers lobbied officials to perform their professional duties and advocated the delivery of rights, impartial administration of law, and equitable access to social and economic development. This article explores the initial phase of Dalit Panther politics in Tamil Nadu through its own documentary evidence, drawing upon DPI Chairman A. Malaichamy's personal letters, written appeals, and received correspondence, as well as original pamphlets and handbills distributed at political rallies. Countering interpretations of Dalit assertion that accentuate `illiberal' techniques as its natural form and state welfare as its principle target, the article shows that legal advocacy served as an integral feature of early DPI politics. But, when state institutions proved unresponsive and the movement developed a grassroots presence, DPI activists expanded their programme to encompass contentious street politics as a complementary means to make claims on state authority, amplify their voices to centres of power, and demand recognition as democratic citizens.

N2  - The notion of strategic policy transfer builds upon existing accounts of policy transfer that assume selectivity in terms of what governments choose to learn from abroad. This article analyses the case of public administration in Romania, which, at first glance, appears to have embraced policy transfer as part of the process of Europeanisation and other modernisation initiatives emanating from international institutions such as the World Bank. Based on interviews with policy elites in Romania, the authors establish that those elites were not interested in learning about administrative improvements from abroad because they were self-evidently workable but because it satisfied key external actors. Furthermore, the high degree of politicisation of the Romanian bureaucracy, which remains a legacy of its Communist past, continues to act as a barrier to change, and may result in the reversal of reforms now EU membership is fully established.

N2  - The ``regional directors of education{''} (recteurs d'academie) are French exceptions, legacies from Napoleonic University. Whereas everywhere else, they are elected presidents of their universities, the regional directors are, in France, government official representing directly the Minister of Education. Until 1940, two periods could schematically be singled out in the evolution fo the office. Beginning with the founder decree from March 1809 to June 1854, a rather delicate period of ``running in{''} showed the directors of Education as sorts of supervisors, for the most part in charge of secondary and then primary studies, who also asserted the State rights in education. However, they had to face numerous oppositions, especially with the Falloux Law in 1850, which strongly damaged the office, with the creation of departmental directors of education. From June 1854 to 1940 at least, the regional directors were offered real prestige. Almost irremovable, they showed great interest in higher education - from which they came - and they set up the Republic educative structures. Concerning professional origins, that office was somewhat rapidly professionalized and the recruits came mainly from Public Instruction. The social origins of the recruiting were more complex. If the former aristocratic elite had kept a steady place for quite a long time, then its role decreased at the benefit of men from lower middle and middle classes. The world of State officers gradually became the main social group wherein the new regional directors of education were numerously recruited.

N2  - Democracy was the great victor of the Second World War. In contrast to
the kaleidoscopic variety of regimes which had emerged in Europe during
the preceding thirty years, the political structure of Western Europe
from 1945 to the 1960s possessed a remarkable uniformity. Despite
significant national differences, Europe's postwar model of democracy
was based on a number of key characteristics: the reassertion of the
authority of the nation-state and of directly-elected parliaments as
well as a culture of coalition government which accorded considerable
freedom of manoeuvre to the central bureaucracy and to paragovernmental
lobbyists at the expense of direct popular participation. This article
explores the reasons which underpinned the successful stabilization of
this particular form of democracy in postwar Europe. Though the Cold War
and rapid economic growth were influential factors, the remarkable
resilience of liberal parliamentary regimes must also be related to the
more individualist and depoliticized society which emerged from the war
years, to changes in the structure and attitudes of the social elites
and to the successful construction of a dominant class alliance of the
middle classes and the rural populations of Europe, symbolized by the
electoral success of Christian Democracy.

N2  - The preproposal stage of the rulemaking process is notoriously understudied, but enormously important in determining regulatory outputs. Recently, Rinfret (2011c) analyzed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) rulemaking process and developed a frame analysis model to interpret stakeholder influence during the preproposal stage. Rinfret argues that stakeholders use three frames to influence agency rulemaking, including an expertise, a fiscal feasibility, and an information frame. This article tests this model to determine whether it is applicable to other federal agencies such as the National Park Service (NPS). Through an analysis of stakeholder framing within the 2012 NPS Yellowstone Winter Use Rule, this research confirms that Rinfret's model is indeed applicable to the NPS process. Therefore, this research suggests that this theoretical model examining stakeholder influence is applicable to other public land agencies, and arguably can be applied across the bureaucracy.

N2  - Amidst congressional gridlock, administrative rulemaking is the main pathway for environmental policy making. Scholars have assessed the role of the institutions of government (the president, Congress, and the courts) and key interest groups (i.e., business and environmental interests) in shaping rulemaking outcomes. What is missing from this literature is an assessment of the role of key implementers, state environmental agencies. This research fills this gap by assessing the role and impact of state government agencies in three case studies of rulemaking at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Based on original interviews and a public comment analysis, this research suggests that state agencies play an active and influential role in EPA rulemaking. And, in some cases, state agencies wield more influence than other interest groups. Interviewees argued that this influence stems from these agencies’ unique voice as an implementation collaborator. As a result, researchers should incorporate an assessment of the role of these interests to more effectively explain regulatory outcomes at the EPA and potentially across the bureaucracy.

N2  - Explanations of politicization tend to focus on historical trends, administrative traditions, and government preferences. Absent from this literature are the actions of bureaucrats themselves. Drawing on theories of employee resistance from organization studies suggesting that changes threatening the financial security and professional identity of employees may be resisted, this article explores whether bureaucrats resist, and seek to deter, efforts of politicization. Through a most likely case study design of New Brunswick (Canada), this article finds that bureaucrats not only resisted efforts of politicization but that such actions also deterred the government from making any further dismissals.

N2  - Whether there has been a centralisation of power towards the first minister and her entourage of courtiers during the 20th century is a contentious issue among scholars of parliamentary systems. A principle reason for the endurance of this debate is the absence of empirical indicators that can be compared over time. This article contributes to this research by examining a primary means the centre is believed to have increased its control: the appointment of administrative elites. Using an original data set of deputy minister turnover in Canada's provincial bureaucracies from 1920 to 2013, this article tests whether the relationship between a change in the first minister and bureaucratic mobility has shifted over time. Consistent with the centralisation of power thesis, the results show that the level of mobility following a transition in the first minister and party has increased since 1980. Moreover, whereas before 1980 only a change in first minister alongside a transition in party leads to increased mobility, since then, mobility increases alongside all newly elected first ministers, regardless of party change. This relationship is not found among unelected first ministers, who are believed to have a different relationship with cabinet and party members than elected first ministers.

N2  - The extent to which new governments appoint and dismiss senior public servants is widely claimed to be influenced by their country's underlying administrative tradition. This is particularly the case within the Westminster tradition where such turnover is limited in nature, with most appointees coming from within the ranks of the public service. This article challenges the assertion that turnover in the Westminster tradition is homogeneously internal. Theorizing that new governments appoint senior public servants to increase their control over the bureaucracy, and that the desire for control is negatively correlated to trust, this article develops hypotheses between the trust new governments harbour towards the bureaucracy and whether they appoint and dismiss bureaucrats from within or outside the public service. The hypotheses are tested with longitudinal data measuring internal and external appointments and departures to the senior public service in Canada's provincial governments over a period of 18 years. The results from various multinomial regression models suggest that political appointments to the public service are not as homogenous as frequently suggested. Although a transition in the governing party and a newly elected premier from the same party of the previous government both lead to an increase in bureaucratic turnover, a newly elected first minister has a greater incidence of internal turnover than a change in party, meanwhile the level of external turnover does not meaningfully differ between these two political events.

N2  - Judicial oversight provides an important check on executive and legislative power. Two components of judicial oversight have been identified in the literature: judicial independence and constitutional review. Recent research using country-level data indicates that the effectiveness of constitutional review is largely determined by the rigidity of the constitution. In this paper, I use state-level data to test whether judicial independence and constitutional rigidity are related to a specific type of abuse of power by government officials: corruption in office. Specifically, I fit negative binomial regressions in which the dependent variable is the number of officials convicted for corrupt acts and the independent variables are (i) measures of judicial independence, such as judges' remuneration, method of appointment, and term length, along with various controls or (ii) measures of constitutional rigidity, such as legislative majorities required to propose constitutional amendments and provisions for constitutional conventions or constitutional initiatives, along with various controls. I find that, in general, states with higher levels of judicial independence and more rigid constitutions have lower levels of corruption per capita than states with the opposite characteristics.

N2  - This book presents a study of the relationship between Cabinet-level Ministers and top civil servants in Ireland. The nature of this relationship can potentially have far-reaching effects on people’s lives as it can influence the type of public policy agreed at top levels of government. A total of sixteen interviews were carried out for the research, eight with retired Cabinet-level Ministers and eight with retired Secretaries General of Irish government departments. Anonymity, not just for the participants but also for the government departments in which they had served, was vital to the success of the research. Also vital was the fact that only retirees were interviewed as this removed the fear for participants that their careers might suffer if they spoke too frankly. The result is a collection of interviews containing frank and open views on the relationship between Ministers and their officials and on how this relationship influences public policy development. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.

N2  - Clientelism, the exchange of selective rewards for votes, is fraught with commitment problems and questions remain regarding how it occurs in settings lacking strong parties. In such settings, we argue, bureaucrats can act as brokers using their own networks. Bureaucrats can use their discretionary power to cultivate reciprocal relations with voters and leverage this political capital in negotiations with politicians to secure career advancements. As brokering requires networks, we hypothesize that bureaucrats with connections to civil society are more likely to exhibit brokering behavior, and especially in localities with stronger civil society. Original survey data of bureaucrats (N=1300) in a context of weak parties, Peru's 25 regions plus the city of Lima, show that bureaucrats with connections to civil society are more likely to exhibit brokering behavior. Political and party connections are weaker predictors of brokering. The paper thus shows how locally connected bureaucrats may aid in coordinating clientelism.

N2  - This article examines the diffusion of meritocratic practices as a potential instance of policy transfer by scrutinizing the introduction of open and competitive examinations during the mid-nineteenth century in the British Civil Service. Scholars have argued that British reformers were inspired by meritocratic practices in British-ruled India. In order to assess this claim, we combine qualitative analysis of archival material documenting the interdepartmental debates on meritocratic reforms in the British Home Civil Service as well as in the Indian Civil Service with quantitative analyses of unique data on the implementation of examinations with open competition in British public offices and the India experience of Heads of Departments. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses largely reject the idea that the Indian Civil Service was a key source of inspiration for British merit reforms. While our quantitative analyses show some, albeit weak, evidence, no such evidence was found in the qualitative analysis.

N2  - The success of Greek shipowners in merchant shipping has created a cloud of mystery about the reasons behind this phenomenon. The most frequently suggested reason is the natural flair of the Greek officers and seamen, which has developed over the centuries of living next to the sea. Though the drive and talent of the Greek seamen is not disputed, there are obviously other factors at play when it comes to explaining this success. The question asked in this chapter is, what the shipowners' associations' roles in Greece have been and how influential these stakeholders' interest groups have been in shipping policy formation. This chapter attempts to examine several aspects of the above question, aiming to shed light on the success of Greek owners in merchant shipping. Though the title of this chapter focuses on the role of the shipowners' associations, discussion is not solely limited to their roles. With this opportunity, the analysis provides an insight of what has been going on in the various sectors of Greek-owned shipping, thus adding to the analyses undertaken in other relevant chapters of this book.

N2  - Judicial independence is generally accepted as a key component of the rule of law. It empowers judges to make unbiased decisions without concern for political repercussions. In countries governed by an unconstitutional, unlawful or corrupt regime, such as Zimbabwe,2 Swaziland,3 Pakistan4 and Fiji,5 that independence, and in turn the rule of law, is threatened. More particularly, acceptance of judicial office in an unlawful regime could be regarded as making an implicit bargain with the government to recognise its validity.6
This article begins with a discussion of the importance of judicial independence, both from a national and an international perspective. It then examines the standards of judicial integrity and some of the factors that impact upon independence, including appointment and tenure, and the less obvious influence of jurisdiction. The article then moves on to consider the issues arising from acceptance of judicial office in an illegal regime in the context of Fiji, where lawyers and judicial officers have recently been forced to decide whether or not to accept appointment in a regime with an unelected government. After outlining the background to the latest events in Fiji, the article examines the competing considerations and ethical dilemmas involved in deciding whether to accept judicial appointment in an illegal regime. It then goes on to consider the possible repercussions of accepting such appointment from both a disciplinary and criminal perspective. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking has long focused on both the use of expertise and public accountability. However, few have considered the degree to which public input affects the use of research in U.S. regulatory impact analyses (RIAs). We examine changes in the research that is cited in RIAs in response to public comments to assess the influence of participation on the use of information for rulemaking. We conduct an in-depth analysis of comments on a major proposed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule to determine whether regulators alter the evidence used based on public input and whether some types of commenters have more influence than others. We analyze the text similarity of comments to scientific research utilized in the RIAs to determine whether regulators iteratively update their rule justification based on scientific information referenced in comments. We find support for seminal subgovernment theories about the relationship between business interests, Congress, and the bureaucracy; in relation to all kinds of commenters, members of Congress and industry groups had the strongest effect on changes in the research used in the RIAs. The article provides one of the first statistical analyses of science exchange between the public and a bureaucratic agency.

N2  - CFSP has traditionally been studied as a policy-making domain that is reserved to negotiations among formal representatives from the EU and its member states. In this article, we draw attention to the way in which the CFSP bureaucracy interacts with transnational actors from civil society. We conceptualize this relationship on the basis of three mechanisms: access to European policy-making in return for information, coalition building dynamics, and socialization processes. We illustrate the importance of these mechanisms for the EU’s policy on the International Criminal Court (ICC). Specifically, we argue that NGOs have gained routine access to the COJUR-ICC working group, where they have obtained a prominent status as experts, participating in information exchange coalition building dynamics. This has also translated into NGO influence on important aspects of the EU’s foreign policy towards the ICC.

In public choice theory, the actors are individuals (such as voters, politicians, bureaucrats and lobbyists), not countries or states. As individuals, they may be members of collective organizations. Within these organizations, they may take collective decisions according to the rules which they or others have agreed upon. © Michael Reksulak, Laura Razzolini and William F. Shughart II 2013.

N2  - Contemporary policy debates construct public involvement in England's National Health Service as ``new,'' or as a practice dating back only as far as the 1990s. This article argues that the longer historical contexts of such consultative practice matter, and it explores various and shifting manifestations of ``consultation'' in the NHS from the foundation of the Service in 1948. In doing so, it first demonstrates that consultation has always been a part of the theory and practice of postwar health policy. Thinking about consultation as ``new'' presents such practice as unnecessary or transient, and may function as part of a damaging political vision of public affection for the NHS as a barrier to reform. Second, the article asserts that public interest in shaping NHS practice and policy has never been fully satisfied by official consultative mechanisms. ``The public'' is not a homogeneous group, but rather composed of various groups, communities, and individuals with rich perspectives and histories to share, having experienced the NHS as patients, friends, supporters, staff, and volunteers. Policy-makers should approach diverse publics as partners, and should meaningfully listen to protests around NHS reform, which often reflect public investment in the NHS, as well as valid concerns about how particular communities will be able to access health care. While the political will for such engagement has varied over time, individual politicians and local-level health agencies can make a difference by supporting, engaging with, and funding organizations which represent and empower a diverse range of communities: such groups have always, and will continue to play, a significant role in shaping NHS debate and care.

N2  - Based on a case study of the Indian intervention in Sri Lanka's ethnic war from 1987 to 1990, this article explores the conditions under which democracies can act as effective third parties to resolve civil violence. India's experience as guarantor of a peace settlement in Sri Lanka suggests that not only the intractability of civil conflicts but the power of domestic pressures shape intervention policies and outcomes. Decision-makers depend on the support of important domestic political elites - political parties, interest groups, press, and governmental bureaucracies - as well as the approval of the public who can reject them in periodic elections. In order to enforce peace settlements, third-party guarantors must have a firm sense of the belligerents' intentions and resources, sensitivity to the dynamics of the conflict, and freedom of action. At the same time, democratic leaders must consider the role of timing, the influence of internal bargaining, the importance of credible `staying power', and personal reputation.

N2  - Policies relating to contraceptive services (population, family planning and reproductive health policies) often receive weak or fluctuating levels of commitment from national policy elites in Southern countries, leading to slow policy evolution and undermining implementation. This is true of Kenya, despite the governments early progress in committing to population and reproductive health policies, and its success in implementing them during the 1980s. This key informant study on family planning policy in Kenya found that policy space contracted, and then began to expand, because of shifts in contextual factors, and because of the actions of different actors. Policy space contracted during the mid-1990s in the context of weakening prioritization of reproductive health in national and international policy agendas, undermining access to contraceptive services and contributing to the stalling of the countrys fertility rates. However, during the mid-2000s, champions of family planning within the Kenyan Government bureaucracy played an important role in expanding the policy space through both public and hidden advocacy activities. The case study demonstrates that policy space analysis can provide useful insights into the dynamics of routine policy and programme evolution and the challenge of sustaining support for issues even after they have reached the policy agenda.

N2  - It is widely accepted that better-connected firms exercise more political influence. However, because both social ties and political influence are difficult to observe, it remains little understood how different types of ties affect different types of political action. We develop new theory that contrasts the effects of ties to other firms in the same industry (peer ties) with ties to elected officials and bureaucrats (government ties). We argue that peer ties are useful for facilitating collective action, which is most often used to seek influence over broad policy issues that affect many firms. In contrast, while government ties are more versatile, these should primarily also allow firms to pursue narrow, particularistic issues that benefit only one or a small number of firms. Using a new survey of foreign-owned firms operating in the Philippines, we demonstrate that peer ties play an important role in firms' efforts to influence policy at the national level, where issues are more likely to affect large numbers of firms. Government ties are also valuable, though primarily at the local level, where issues are more likely to affect a smaller number of firms.

N2  - The three municipalities (Qingdao, Jinan and Linyi) have made great efforts in constructing transparent government. The formal regulation for openness in accessing government information was issued after 1998 in Qingdao, Jinan and Linyi cities. The local government's website, online public involvement and public hearings on important issues were introduced in 1999. Nevertheless, all three governments should further improve government transparency in terms of implementing open recruitment and appointment processes for official and increasing the interaction with citizens. It seems that the Qingdao government has performed the best for all five aspects of transparent government. The Jinan government has performed better than the Linyi government.

N2  - Shortly after the November 1998 statewide elections, the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, the first tribe to operate a casino in California, hosted the annual Indio Powwow and Native American Festival, which brings together forty tribes from across the country. While the powwow included the display of traditional songs and dances typical of the eleven previous years of the festival, it also contained a significant new element: a guest list of three newly elected statewide officials-Governor Gray Davis, Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, and attorney General Bill Lockyer. a year later, tribal leaders reciprocated the acknowledgment of the transformed tribal-state relationship by attending the annual convention of the state Democratic Party instead of the annual festival (Patringenaru 1999; Wert 1998). These two events symbolize the changed tribal-state relations in California and the newfound political status of Native American tribes. How did Indian tribes ascend to power in the California political system? What steps did tribes take to establish their gambling monopoly and grow it into one of the most lucrative industries in the state?.

N2  - Different interest groups play a role in regulatory governance. One frequently neglected is the group of professionals that run regulatory agencies and pursue regulatory goals. The objective of this paper is to give “regulocrats” center stage. It interprets data from a survey conducted by Brazilian institutions, shedding light on the major preferences of the “regulocrats”, and on how they go about implementing policy and interacting with other actors. Data is combined with a state capacity perspective so as to elaborate on the findings. The paper concludes by articulating an idea of a particular kind of hybridism in the Brazilian “regulocracy”.

N2  - Drawing on the collapse of Morandi bridge (Genoa, Italy) exemplar and unique case and by applying a content analysis to the declarations made by politicians in the subsequent months after the tragedy, the paper highlights how longstanding debates about the relative merits of concessions vis a vis direct public operations can become the terrain of intense political contestation in the wake of a public tragedy. In particular, it shows how PPPs predicated on transferring risks to the partner best able to manage them create opportunities for blame shifting by politicians, bureaucracies and firms when failures occur.

N2  - The neo-Weberian approach as a public management model is a relatively new phenomenon in the theory of public administration. However, the first attempts to define it in practical terms were made several decades ago in the administrations and economies of European countries, mainly in continental Europe. Specifically, the roots of the approach in question date back to enlightened absolutism, to the beginnings of the formation of a democratic law-governed state, and to the modern Weberian bureaucracy. The key aspects of this heritage have survived to the present day and can be found in a number of European countries. This testifies to the viability of the concept despite its absence from the mainstream academic discourse and public debate. It has become, among other things, the source of remedies for the adverse socio-economic effects of globalisation, such as the erosion of sovereignty of nation-states and the undermining of their position in international relations with respect to transnational actors. The second category of reasons which contribute to the increased interest in the neo-Weberian principles includes not only the adverse consequences of the ‘hollowing-out of the state,’ but also the unsatisfactory results of reforms based on the principles of NPM and public governance. The third group of factors includes attempts to capture public resources by interest groups and the dismantling of the welfare state.

N2  - Job rotation is an important tool in public administration that is used
to enhance learning and diversify experience among employees, while
reducing opportunities for rent-seeking behaviour. The benefits of job
rotation, however, may be reduced if carried out too frequently or for
narrow partisan reasons. Frequent transfers and postings in a civil
service characterized by life-long contracts negatively impact
on-the-job learning, accountability for results, and incentives to
acquire skills. This study examines the political and internal civil
service determinants of frequent transfers in the civil service of
Punjab, Pakistan. We employ Poisson panel estimations for 338 job
positions for elite management cadres in Pakistan over a five-year
period from 2006 to 2010. The analysis shows that a change in elected
government and desirability of a position increase the frequency of
transfers.

N2  - The global health community is increasingly advocating for the local production of pharmaceuticals in developing countries as a way to promote technology transfer, capacity building and improve access to medicines. However, efforts to advance drug manufacturing in these countries revive an old dilemma of fostering technological development versus granting access to social services, such as healthcare. This paper explores the case of Brazil, a country that has developed large-scale health-inspired industrial policies, but is, yet, little understood. Brazil’s experience suggests that progressive healthcare bureaucrats can create innovative practices for technology and knowledge transfers. It also demonstrates that highly competitive pharmaceutical firms can collaborate with each other, if a government provides them the right incentives. Reforming regulatory policies is crucial for guaranteeing high-quality products in developing countries, but governments must play a crucial role in supporting local firms to adapt to these regulations. These findings send a strong message to global health policymakers and practitioners on the conditions to create a suitable environment for local production of medical products. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - The Military Police are guided by two fundamental pillars discipline and hierarchy making them a complex organization with-groups of interests that hinder their capacity to change. The aim of the present study is to identify how the organization is structured and to relate it to mental health. We tried to contextualize the purposes of public safety services through a brief history of the state police, its division and how it has been used against daily violence. Based on labor psychology view, we made use of techniques and concepts based on the Ergonomics of the Activity and on labor Psychodynamics; observing the work process,document research, individual and collective interviews. Qualitative analysis demonstrated that military,officers are in the center of a link of forces coming from work organization, the precariousness of the work and, finally, from the contemporary society. The ways these relationships of forces are joined contribute to harmful implications to the mental health of professionals, favoring the increase in psychological suffering and it can lead to alcoholism, depression, and even suicide. Data-from Medical Council of Joao Pessoa, (2003 to 2005), show an average of 489 military officers who retired from work on medical grounds. These are worrisome figures in an area of public service that is essential to the population. These figures would be higher if the leaves granted in the workplace were also included. Procedures for granting internal leaves occur in an attempt to mediate the possible long period of health treatment.

Production and interpretation skills attained through the participation in community media would allow persons to become more discriminating in their views. It gives them a voice to speak out actively on the matters affecting their lives. In this sense, community media will be subversive to any group, bureaucracy, or individual, who feels threatened by a coalescing of grassroots consciousness. Through reporting on the issues affecting women and advocating their rights, an all-women community radio in Nepal is working towards their empowerment. Based on the theoretical perspectives of power and media, this article through a case study, highlights how bringing Violence Against Women (VAW) into the alternative public sphere contributes towards women empowerment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This Research Note explores the political dynamics of bureaucratic turnover. It argues that changes in a government's policy objectives can shift both political screening strategies and bureaucratic selection strategies, which produces turnover of agency personnel. To buttress this conjecture, it analyzes a unique dataset tracing the careers of all agency heads in the Swedish executive bureaucracy between 1960 and 2014. It shows that, despite serving on fixed terms and with constitutionally protected decision-making powers, Swedish agency heads are considerably more likely to leave their posts following partisan shifts in government. The note concludes that, even in institutional systems seemingly designed to insulate bureaucratic expertise from political control, partisan politics can shape the composition of agency personnel.

N2  - This article aims to explain cross-country variations in a paradigmatic element of the new public management reforms: the shift from low-powered incentives (i.e., flat salaries) to high-powered ones (i.e., performance-related pay {[}PRP] systems). It presents a theoretical model based on insights developed for understanding the success of performance-related incentives in the private sector. Economic literature has underlined the need for a system of separation of interests within firms to make promises on incentives credible. The interests of those who benefit from the incentives (e.g., owners) must be relatively different from the interests of those who manage the incentive system (e.g., managers). Similarly, this article argues that incentives in the public sector are more likely to be implemented in those administrations in which there is a relative separation between those who benefit from the incentives (e.g., politicians) and those who manage the incentive system (e.g., senior civil servants). Where the interests of both groups overlap (e.g., the careers of senior officials and politicians are intertwined), incentives will be less credible and thus less likely. A quantitative analysis for 25 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries confirms that PRP is significantly more used in contexts with clear separation of interests between politicians and senior civil servants.

N2  - This article discusses one of the most important institutions in the modern world, namely public bureaucracies, from a comparative perspective. Bureaucratic organizations can be seen as a result of handling dilemmas along two critical dimensions. The first dimension concerns whether bureaucrats should be autonomous or, on the contrary, directly accountable to their political masters. The second dimension is about whether bureaucrats should always be guided by the letter of the law, strictly following established rules, or, on the contrary, guided by the principle of management, searching for the most efficient solution. We review the extensive recent research on the effects of different ways of organizing public bureaucracies along these two dimensions. Specifically, we look at three fundamental outcomes: economic development, corruption, and the quality of public services. We conclude by discussing the pros and cons of the four types of bureaucracies-legalistic (accountability and law), populistic (accountability and management), Weberian (autonomy and law), and liberal (autonomy and management)-and how they relate to, but do not overlap with, the concept of administrative traditions.

N2  - This paper addresses the politicization of public institutions through the case of national ombudspersons. While there is an established literature on the politicization of top public officials, we lack research on the politicization and/or de-facto independence of supreme or supervisory bodies, including ombuds institutions. In this paper, we combine the insights of three bodies of literature in order to build a framework for the empirical study of national ombuds institutions: Literature (1) on the independence of public institutions, in particular ombuds and regulatory agencies, (2) on politicization and party patronage in state institutions, and (3) on career patterns and selection criteria of top public officials and the administrative elite. We then discuss these issues on the basis of an empirical field study of the Austrian ombuds institution: First, drawing on a socio-demographic analysis of ombudspersons we identify common features of their profiles and career paths. We find that overall the ombudspersons represent a relatively homogenous group, but the political party represents an explanatory variable for some of the ombudspersons' characteristics. The second set of empirical results, drawing primarily on qualitative interviews with case-handling staff, demonstrates that despite the institution's public efforts and many interviewees' reassurances that the AOB is independent and acts as such, there are several areas in which party-related positions become visible in the AOB's work. These results are integrated into a typology on the effects of political appointment modes of ombudspersons, which should enable further research in this field.

N2  - We present a model where a long run player is allowed to use both money
transfers and threats to influence the decisions of a sequence of short
run players. We show that threats might be used credibly (even in
arbitrarily short repeated games) by along-lived player who gains by
developing a reputation of carrying out punishments. Particular cases of
the model are a long-lived pressure group offering rewards and
punishments to a series of targets (public or corporate officials) in
exchange for policy favors, or that of a long-lived extorter who demands
money in order not to punish. We use the model to analyze the
``convicted nonpayor{''} debate around judicial corruption. The model
highlights formal similarities between lobbying and extortion.

N2  - Despite high-profile divergences, competition officials in the European Union and United States frequently state a desire to reach convergent substantive decisions when regulating individual transatlantic merger cases. The extent of transatlantic convergence depends largely on the role of two domestic actors involved in the merger review process: regulators and firms. This article employs two competing approaches (principal-agent and regulatory capture) to assess the ways in which these actors and domestic institutions shape convergence in transatlantic merger review. Empirically, the article investigates the work of the EU-US Mergers Working Group and explores the extent to which it conforms more closely to the preferences of regulators or merging firms. By increasing procedural convergence over information exchanges, the competition regulators increase the likelihood of convergence in substantive decisions, which reduces the likelihood of intervention by political principals. The findings suggest that regulators have used their discretionary authority to overcome domestic political and legal institutions that obstruct information sharing and have reduced the information asymmetry traditionally enjoyed by merging firms. As a result, it is the regulatory agents who have shaped the convergent process via their discretionary authority and captured the merging firms to serve their regulatory interests.

N2  - The Chief Justice brings together leading scholars of the courts who employ social science theory and research to explain the role of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. They consider the chief justice's appointment, office, powers, and influence both within the Court and in the American system of government more generally. The chief justice presides over oral arguments and the justices' private conferences. The chief justice speaks first in those conferences, presents cases and other matters to the other justices, and assigns the Court's opinions in all cases in which the chief justice votes with the majority. In addition, the chief justice presides over the Judicial Conference of the United States, a policy-making body composed of lower-court federal judges. As Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court is "the most important judicial officer in the world."

N2  - In this Note, Sheri Danz evaluates the impact of the evolution of the public forum doctrine on advocates' claims of access to welfare centers. Welfare agencies often prohibit legal advocates from associating with and educating welfare applicants on welfare center grounds Recently, courts have applied the public forum doctrine to uphold welfare agency restrictions on advocacy against First Amendment challenges by advocates. Danz argues that despite the increasingly formalistic and deferential nature of the Supreme Court's public forum decisions, reviewing courts should not uphold welfare agency policies that prohibit advocacy in welfare center waiting rooms. She first examines the use of bureaucratic disentitlement practices by welfare agencies to deny applicants their statutory rights and deprive them of much-needed benefits. Danz argues that these practices invoke a core concern of the First Amendment-to protect the right of citizens to check governmental abuse. Next, she explores changes in the public forum doctrine and assesses their impact on advocates' claims of access to welfare center waiting rooms. Finally, Danz identifies three grounds under the modern public forum doctrine that should lead a reviewing court to overturn prohibitions on advocacy at welfare centers: Restrictions on advocacy in welfare center waiting rooms lack the compelling interest required for restrictions in designated public fora, many prohibitions on advocacy reflect viewpoint-discriminatory motives, and courts that view restrictions as a component of bureaucratic disentitlement may find that restrictions on advocacy fail reasonably to promote legitimate governmental goals.

N2  - This article outlines the commitment of the Commonwealth and its institutions to a public right to official information, its promotion of the enactment and effective implementation of freedom of information (FOI) legislation, and progress to date in member states. It identifies obstacles to more widespread introduction of access to information laws, and describes the work of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative through years of advocacy for the adoption of such laws, the training of bureaucrats, lawyers and parliamentarians from around the Commonwealth, and collaborations with civil rights organisations, coalitions and activists. It stresses that engendering a regime of transparency is more complicated than merely enacting an FOI law. Citing successes of the Indian grass-roots movement in promoting the right to information, and successfully encouraging the use of enacted statutes through the dissemination of information about its provisions and usage, it calls for capacity building in both civil society and the media to work towards successful outcomes elsewhere in the Commonwealth. © 2015 The Round Table Ltd.

N2  - Most Americans assume that U.S. foreign policy is determined by democratically elected leaders who define and protect the common good of the citizens and the nation they represent. Increasingly, this conventional wisdom falls short of explaining the real climate in Washington. Well organized private-interest groups are capitalizing on Americans' ignorance of world politics to advance their own agendas. Supported by vast economic resources and powerful lobbyists, these groups thwart the constitutional checks and balances designed to protect the U.S. political system, effectively bullying or buying our national leaders. Lawrence Davidson traces the history, evolution, and growing influence of these private organizations from the nation's founding to the present, and he illuminates their profoundly disturbing impact on the direction of U.S. foreign policy. Foreign Policy, Inc.: Privatizing America's National Interest demonstrates how economic interest groups once drove America's westward expansion and designed the nation's overseas imperial policies. Using the contemporary Cuba and Israel lobbies as examples, Davidson then describes the emergence of political lobbies in the twentieth century and shows how diverse groups with competing ethnic and religious agendas began to organize and shape American priorities abroad. Despite the troubling influence of these specialized lobbies, many Americans remain indifferent to the hijacking of American foreign policy. Americans' focus on local events and their lack of interest in international affairs renders them susceptible to media manipulation and prevents them from holding elected officials accountable for their ties to lobbies. Such mass indifference magnifies the power of these wealthy special interest groups and permits them to create and implement American foreign policy. The result is that the global authority of the United States is weakened, its integrity as an international leader is compromised, and its citizens are endangered. Debilitated by two wars, a tarnished global reputation, and a plummeting economy, Americans, Davidson insists, can no longer afford to ignore the realities of world politics. On its current path, he predicts, America will cease to be a commonwealth of individuals but instead will become an amoral assembly of competing interest groups whose policies and priorities place the welfare of the nation and its citizens in peril.

N2  - This paper will seek to present an understanding of the historical conditions that make possible a convergence of the selected religious teachings and human rights, and ask the question if such a convergence can operate successfully within a hierarchal bureaucracy such as found in government or institutional religion. The paper will look at three specific case studies where there has been a convergence of human rights and religion and the resulting struggle to influence the behavior of the state: 1. the example of Christian liberation theology in South America in the 1960s and 70s. 2. The example of the movement Rabbis for Human Rights within the Israeli milieu from its founding in 1988 to the present. 3. The example of CAIR –The Council on American-Islamic Relations– which presently operates in the U.S. Within the teachings of most great religious movements are found principles of behavior that support the concept of universal human rights. However, these principles are overshadowed when the religious teachings are enlisted to the needs of institutions, be they of the state or established religious hierarchies. The needs of institutions and hierarchical bureaucracies do not reflect universal human rights and the principles of behavior that underpin them. Rather, such institutions reflect the particular needs of interest groups and elites. These elites often are able to use ideology (which may be religious in nature) to cause their own special interests to be substituted for a community’s more general needs and interests. As the rules of behavior narrow to accommodate institutional and bureaucratic dictates, universal human rights becomes the cause of minority groups and others on the margin of society seeking to reinterpret and broaden the definitions of what is humane and proper behavior. It is within this struggle to reinterpret rules of behavior along the lines of universal human rights that a convergence between religious teaching and human rights becomes most possible. But once again, this will happen as an alliance of those outside the dominant power structure. The three case studies given above demonstrate how this struggle from the margins has been fought in three contemporary arenas. A reasonable conclusion drawn from this is that supporters of universal human rights seem, ironically, condemned to never to attain the structural power necessary to enforce, on a universal scale, the practice of their principles. For, no such structural power exists that is designed to realize such universal ends. Thus, even on those rare occasions when champions of human rights manage to attain positions of power, they are always restrained, co-opted, or otherwise compromised by the institutional and bureaucratic matrices of power–all of which are typically designed to promote and protect particular, and not universal, interests. Thus, from an historical prospective, those promoting universal human rights, even when allied to or inspired by religious teachings, are condemned to always fight as outsiders. For to move inside is to transform universal principles into special interest dictates.

N2  - As part of the process of making an appointment to an advice and consent position, the President usually submits a nomination to the Senate. The Senate's executive clerk, acting on behalf of the Senate's presiding officer, refers the nomination to the appropriate committee or committees on the day it is received. When making a referral, the executive clerk is guided by Senate Rule XXV, which establishes the subject matter under the purview of each committee and directs that ?all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating primarily to [those] subjects? be referred to that committee. The executive clerk is also guided by precedents set by prior referrals and by standing orders and unanimous consent (UC) agreements adopted by the Senate pertaining to the referral of nominations. Most nominations are referred to one committee. For some positions, a nomination or series of nominations to a position are referred to more than one committee, pursuant to a standing order, a UC agreement, or a statutory provision. A nomination may be jointly or sequentially referred to multiple committees. Joint referral has generally occurred when more than one committee has had a claim to jurisdiction over the subject matter related to the position. Under joint referral, the committees receive the nomination simultaneously and may consider it concurrently. All committees to which a nomination is referred must report it to the full Senate or be discharged from its further consideration before it may be considered on the floor. Sequential referral has generally occurred when one committee has had predominant jurisdiction over the subject matter related to the position, but other committees have had a claim as well. Under this process, a nomination is referred to the committee with predominant jurisdiction first and is then sequentially referred to additional committees. Consideration of subsequent referrals can be subject to a time limit after which the committee or committees without primary jurisdiction are automatically discharged from further consideration of the nomination. Certain nominations or categories of nominations are subject to a potentially more expedited Senate consideration pursuant to a standing order adopted in the 112th Congress. This report identifies, by Senate committee, presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation based on referrals as of the date of passage of S. 679, which became P.L. 112-166 on August 10, 2012. This public law removed numerous presidentially appointed positions from the advice and consent process for relevant U.S. Senate committees. A complete list of the presidentially appointed positions that no longer require Senate confirmation may be found in the Appendix of this report. For each committee list, positions are categorized as full- or part-time and then grouped by department or agency. Where nominations have been referred to more than one committee, the organizations and titles are noted under each of the committees to which the nominations were referred. The lists also include the lengths of fixed terms, where applicable. Some commissions, councils, and other multi-member entities are required, by their enabling statutes, to maintain political balance in some way. This is noted in parentheses where applicable. The information provided in this report was compiled from the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System available to the congressional community at http://www.congress.gov/nomis (the public database is http://thomas.loc.gov/home/nomis.html), data on departmental and agency websites, telephone conversations with agency officials, and the United States Code. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

N2  - What explains the selection of cases for WTO adjudication? This article explores the business conditions under which industries lobby their home government to use the WTO adjudication process and the political factors that influence government decisions. It explains the industry pattern of selection for international trade disputes as a function of the velocity of the business environment. While WTO adjudication is seen as costly and slow, a positive ruling brings broad benefits in terms of deterrence against future discrimination. Firms in static industries will invest in WTO dispute settlement to achieve these benefits, but firms in industries shaped by dynamic competition have high opportunity costs that make them less willing to pursue adjudication. This argument accounts for why there are fewer WTO cases about electronics industry issues than there are likely incidences of protectionist measures. Since Japan is a leading exporter and provides a government report with unique data on potential WTO disputes, it was chosen to test the argument in greater depth. Interviews with Japanese business officials and statistical analysis of an original data set provide support for the argument. The authors conclude that the passive attitude toward WTO adjudication by Japan's largest export industry, electronics, and the sensitivity of japan's diplomatic relations with China have constrained the cases that Japan files. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of the WTO for dispute settlement is conditional upon the time horizon of the industry and the political relations among members.

N2  - It is difficult to overestimate the activity of provincial governmental
institutions in the Russian Empire of the latter half of the 19th
century and the beginning of the 20th century since they were connected
to several spheres of life in the province. At the same time, the answer
to the question of how they operated and what they specifically did is
closely associated with the question of who those officials and
employees were who served in those administrative agencies and
implemented laws and ordinances from the central government. Thanks to
research papers that have already been published, it can be recognised
that both numerically and in terms of its quality, the staff of the
administrative agencies of the Province of Estonia could not remain
unaffected by the social processes that took place at the local and
empire-wide levels. At the same time, no study specifically concerning
the personnel of administrative agencies in the Baltic provinces of the
Russian Empire has been published yet in Estonia. The focus of this
article is not the province's officialdom as such and its social
composition but rather the sources used for studying officialdom and the
possibilities for using those sources.
There are quite a number of sources concerning the social composition of
officialdom in the latter half of the 19th century and at the beginning
of the 20th century, yet even nowadays, the greater portion of
researchers are unaware of many of these sources, and similarly, their
research potential remains undetermined. One of those sources is the
service records and personal files of officials and employees. These
records are found in large numbers in the archival collection of
Estonia's provincial government, and their research potential requires
separate research.
The service record (formuljarnoj or posluznoj spisok in Russian) is a
legally prescribed document that established the personal data of an
official and his service career. Keeping service records was a general
mandatory requirement, thus it was the form in which records were kept
of all officialdom and it existed from 1764 to 1917. The research
material for this article is from the collection of service records
deposited in the archival collection of Estonia's provincial government.
This is one of the largest collections of service records of
administrative agencies that operated in Estonian territory. It is
possible to use this collection to study social changes that took place
in the composition of officialdom in governmental institutions over
longer periods of time.
The objective of this article is to introduce to the reader the service
record as a source that is interesting from the standpoint of source
research and which has great research potential.
To this end, the use of the service record document is explored starting
with the normative legislation regulating its content, its structure
until service records were deposited in the archival collections of
administrative agencies, as well as the attributes of the service record
as a source of information on the masses. The possibility of researchers
using this category of source is considered in studying the personnel of
the provincial government and other administrative agencies from the era
of the Russian Empire. Service records are among the best types of
record documentation in terms of their completeness and reliability, and
they have a high degree of representativeness. The form of this document
meant for keeping records of all officialdom makes it possible to
compile databases based on data from these forms. This in turn makes it
possible to conduct both qualitative and quantitative analysis, and to
do so for a particular year or period in terms of the entire
administration, particular administrative agencies, subunits or a
specific group of employees. This all contributes to improved research
of the personnel and functioning of Russia's prerevolutionary state
administrative agencies, and a better understanding of the effect of the
quality of personnel on the work of the province's administration and
the productivity of governmental policy. Considering the current trend
in research and the intrinsic potential of service records, they may
become a prospective source for researching social-political processes
in the latter period of the Russian Empire at both the micro and macro
levels.

Peru is an extremely heterogeneous country, and government officials in Lima often have little information and understanding of the reality experienced by the population of the rest of the country, even in Lima’s shanty towns. © The Save the Children Fund 1992.

N2  - EU politics has long been portrayed as an elite affair in which technocratic deliberation prevails. As a consequence, information supply by interest groups has typically been viewed as part of an expertise-based exchange with policy-makers. Less attention has been devoted to whether the supply of information is also used to exert political pressure. In addition to expertise-based exchanges between interest groups and policy-makers, can we identify the prevalence of information supply that aims to put pressure on EU policy-makers? And under what conditions are different modes of information supply likely to occur? My analysis relies on interviews with 143 lobbyists who were active on a set of 78 legislative proposals submitted by the European Commission between 2008 and 2010. The results demonstrate that expertise-based exchanges are dominant in interactions with civil servants, while political information is predominantly communicated to political officials and often the key substance in outside lobbying tactics. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Due to the politicization of much policymaking in the European Union (EU) and the growing competences of the European Parliament (EP), party groups in the EP have become key targets for organized interests. This article investigates which party groups in the EP are prioritized by EU lobbyists and why. The focus is on two presumed key components of this prioritization process, namely power and position. It is expected that lobbyists take into account both the extent to which parties align with their views and their legislative power. The empirical analysis draws on interviews with 143 interest group officials and their lobbying expenditures on 78 legislative proposals initiated by the European Commission between 2008 and 2010. The analysis suggests that the media prominence of party groups in relation to specific issues as well as the extent to which interest organizations and party groups adopt opposing policy positions considerably shape how party groups in the EP are targeted by lobbyists. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

N2  - Throughout American history, the religious, charitable, and educational organizations that constitute the category of 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations have been important providers of services to the poor and other disadvantaged populations in American society. Three developments in the four decades since the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 help explain why these organizations have become more prominent as providers of various socioeconomic services to immigrants in particular. First, after the act renewed large-scale immigration to the United States, there was an increased need and demand for newcomer services. With political machines largely vanished, local party organizations not interested in reaching out to the new immigrants en masse, and labor unions divided on the immigration issue, nonprofit organizations catering to newcomers proliferated after 1965 (Berry with Arons 2003; Cordero-Guzmán 2001, 2005; Wong 2006). Second, as part of the Great Society programs of the mid-1960s and the federal government's Community Development Block Grant program enacted in 1974, the federal government contracted with nonprofit organizations to provide services to extinguish poverty and foster community development in poor urban areas where many immigrants resided. Third, the push for privatization of the American welfare state since the late 1970s meant that the government contracted more of its services to nonprofit organizations, which grew more dependent on government grants and contracts (Grønbjerg 1993, 2001; Marwell 2004; Salamon 1999; Smith and Lipsky 1993). Privatization further fueled the growth of the nonprofit sector by making nonprofit organizations the key vehicles for the provision of social services to the poor and other disadvantaged groups, including immigrants (Marwell 2004; Silverman 2005). Given nonprofits' increased importance as providers of educational, legal, linguistic, health, employment, and other social services to immigrants in recent decades, I ask in this chapter what role 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations play in structuring the political incorporation of immigrants in contemporary urban America. What role do nonprofit organizations play in mobilizing individual immigrants to civic and political action and what role do they play as political advocates for immigrants' group interests? I rely on an expansive understanding of immigrant political incorporation that includes the mobilization of immigrants' individual participation in electoral and nonelectoral politics as well as group empowerment through the representation of immigrants' collective interests visà- vis government institutions and actors (Jones-Correa 2005). On the whole, the current literature on nonprofit organizations has a bleak or negative view of nonprofits' political activism and suggests that nonprofits have a limited presence and little influence in local politics due to their tax-exempt status and government restrictions that limit these organizations' political activities (Berry with Arons 2003; Chaves, Stephens, and Galaskiewicz 2004). However, if yesteryear's ward politics-where effective organization of political power was inextricably linked to the provision of much-needed services to vulnerable populations-are indicative of the political significance of immigrant-serving organizations, then nonprofits may play an increasingly influential role in the local politics of immigrant political incorporation. I argue that 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations catering to immigrants- which I refer to as immigrant nonprofit organizations-are important political actors that are heavy lifters of immigrants' incorporation at the local level. Nonprofits not only facilitate the political participation of individual immigrants, as documented in the literatures on social capital and civic engagement, but also function as independent actors in local politics advancing the collective interests of the immigrant community. Immigrant nonprofits develop immigrants' political skills and resources, foster immigrants' political interest, and mobilize immigrants' civic and political participation. As advocates for and representatives of the larger immigrant community, immigrant nonprofits articulate immigrants' needs with government officials, shape the local political agenda with regards to immigrant issues, and engage in advocacy on immigrants' behalf with the local legislative branch as well as the local bureaucracy and the local judiciary. Immigrant nonprofits perform these various political functions within the bounds created by government regulations on tax-exempt entities. They participate in various aspects of local political life often under the guise that they are educating immigrants and local government officials alike. At the same time, government officials frequently invite nonprofits' political activism, and participation in the local political process is also part of many organizations' mission to serve the immigrant population. Although some immigrant nonprofits are active in national and transnational political issues, most of the organizations focus more exclusively on local and state issues. In particular, immigrant nonprofits serve as agents of community empowerment and representation that successfully influence local immigrant integration policies as a result of their knowledge and expertise on the immigrant community and their practical and pragmatic (rather than partisan or contentious) orientation toward the policy-making process.

N2  - This article examines the role of immigrant-serving nonprofit organizations in making city bureaucracies more accommodating of immigrants' needs. Scholarship highlights the importance of bureaucrats' professional norms and agencies' inclusive missions in this process of "immigrant bureaucratic incorporation," but this article shows that these factors are not always sufficient to explain it. Case study material of campaigns to make government multilingual in New York City and San Francisco, two cities with immigrant-friendly orientations, shows that constant pressure from nonprofit organizations on legislative and administrative officials was required to make city agencies and their services accessible to limited English proficient immigrants.

N2  - The authors argue that taken-for-granted notions of deservingness and legitimacy among local government officials affect funding allocations for organizations serving disadvantaged immigrants, even in politically progressive places. Analysis of Community Development Block Grant data in the San Francisco Bay Area reveals significant inequality in grants making to immigrant organizations across central cities and suburbs. With data from 142 interviews and documentary evidence, the authors elaborate how a history of continuous migration builds norms of inclusion and civic capacity for public-private partnerships. They also identify the phenomenon of suburban free riding to explain how and why suburban officials rely on central city resources to serve immigrants, but do not build and fund partnerships with immigrant organizations in their own jurisdictions. The analysis affirms the importance of distinguishing between types of immigrant destinations, but argues that scholars need to do so using a regional lens.

N2  - This article sheds new light on the interaction between trade policy formation, politics, and the economy in Colombia in the 20th century. The author combines original ex post interview data on the apertura process that took off in the 1990s with a meta-analysis of earlier studies on the political and economic history of Colombia. The analysis allows for a better understanding of the applicability of standard political-economy models to explain empirically the levels of protection of the manufacturing industry. More specifically, the article sheds new light on the determination of tariff levels, the interaction of conflicting interest groups, the degree of autonomy of the government and the bureaucrats, and the relationship between the ideological profiles of governments and the orientation of their trade policies. It is argued that the Colombian case has wider relevance for understanding the formation of trade policies in other countries in Latin America, especially in contexts with diversified economic structures and shifting government coalitions.

N2  - The purpose of the article is to study, through the activity of those in office, the actual practices in the production of the "common good", understood as the distribution of public goods to the citizens. The interest arises from the tension between politicians ideal behavior -according to universal and publicly orientated rules - and an actual practice that supposes taking into account the interests of individual citizens and certain social groups, as well as the own political interests. The relation between impersonality and public interest is questioned, arguing that personalized distribution of public goods does not suppose necessarily its private appropriation. The article presents an empirical study of the daily activity of politicians with different positions in elective office, all of them belonging to the governing party, in the province of Santiago del Estero, where the political regime has been recognized by the importance of personal relations and bureaucracy politicization. Following a qualitative methodological strategy - that includes the techniques of in-depth interviews and non-participant observation-; the article presents empirical evidence on politicians daily activity and their notions about their practices; paying attention to their connections with the citizens and with other politicians and civil servants. The article shows that the activities of provincial politicians involve personalized contact with the citizens, as well as with civil servants of different levels of the public administration; which allow them facilitate the distribution of public goods to their electoral base; activities which are mainly informal. Although their actions benefit individual citizens and certain territorial groups -far from of the abstract notion of citizenship-, this does not exclude common good promotion. The leaders can also obtain a personal political benefit, different from their "private" interest, since it necessarily supposes favouring other citizens or groups of citizens. The article puts in question the canonical relation between impersonality and public interest -present in academic literature-, specifying the distinction between personal political links and privatization; even suggesting a complementary relation among particularistic practices and the universality expected from political representatives.

N2  - This article uses the Defense Coalition model, proposed by Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith (1993), to analyze the prevalence of Santa Catarina scientific community as a key factor in the development of the Science and Technology Policy (STP) at Santa Catarina state, Brazil. Data collection relied on official reports and documents from the institutions involved in the STP as well as interviews with 10 actors in the creation of the STP process who occupied strategic roles in the period of 1989-2009, categorized as follows: 1) scientific community, 2) bureaucrats; 3) politically chosen; 4) business owners and 5) politicians. The data analysis relied on the sensitizing concepts used in the defense coalition model a) the role of actors; b) belief system and resources; c) paths of public policy; d) characteristics of the public policy; e) content of the public policy. Connections between actors, their beliefs, strategies, resources and constraints were identified. The research concludes that the scientific community plays a leading role in the formulation of science and technology policy in Santa Catarina, and hold a prevalent role in the creation of the PCT throughout the analyzed period. Regarding business owners, politicians and bureaucrats, the research did not identify a prominent and continuous role of these actors. However, the political chosen ones, who often are recruited within the scientific community, played an important role in reaffirming the shaping of the belief system in the scientific community. Regarding the main trajectories that help explaining the changes of Santa Catarina PCT in the analyzed period, the trajectory "public policy-oriented learning" seems to have an edge over the other trajectories.

N2  - Public sector reforms aimed at ‘making the managers manage’ granted public managers autonomy and tried to depoliticize the administration. There is substantial variation in the degree of direct politicization and in managerial autonomy. This article tests four sets of hypotheses to explain variation in perceptions of direct politicization and managerial autonomy in European public sectors. Data from a new survey in 15 countries among several thousand top public sector managers in central government are used. Findings show that variation in perceived direct politicization and managerial autonomy is partially determined by the formal status of an organization as an agency, and the hierarchical position of the manager within the organization. Managers from very large organizations also experience more autonomy, but organization size has no impact on perceived politicization. The policy field within which the respondent’s organization is situated has mixed effects. The article also finds that the models are better at explaining the variation in perceived managerial autonomy than that in direct politicization. Points for practitioners The article shows that top public managers in European central administration perceive different levels in the extent to which politicians try to influence senior-level appointments, as well as in the extent of management autonomy that they have. These differences in perception are mainly explained by whether or not they work in an agency, as well as by the hierarchical position that they occupy within the organization. © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Basic income advocates propose a model that they believe will dramatically improve on current welfare programmes by alleviating poverty, reducing involuntary unemployment and social exclusion, redistributing care work, achieving a better work-life balance, and so on. Whether these expected social effects materialise in practice critically depends on how the model is implemented, but on this topic the basic income debate remains largely silent. Few advocates explicitly consider questions of implementation, and those that do are typically dismissive of the administrative challenges of implementing a basic income and critical (even overtly hostile) towards bureaucracy. In this contribution we briefly examine (and rebut) several reasons that have led basic income advocates to ignore administration. The main peril of such neglect, we argue, is that it misleads basic income advocates into a form of Panglossian optimism that risks causing basic income advocacy to become self-defeating.

N2  - Using an extensive case analysis of the Bhoomi system of India, this paper examines the role and nature of the state with regards to the rationale for and deployment of e-government systems. Issues such as the nature of control in governance, the discourse of de-politicization in justifying e-government and the reinvention of the state via electronic means are examined. Analysis of data collected over several years shows that e-government systems are primarily used to centralize control in the hands of the upper echelons of the bureaucracy, a strong discourse of technology and `high modernism' permeates the justification for deploying e-government and this effectively de-politicizes the intent and purpose of the project. The paper concludes that through e-government the state reinvents itself, as the e-State, as a powerful, centralized force that disrupts historical practices and relations.

N2  - Innovation and creativity are vital to the world economy but the ­global intellectual property (IP) rules that govern trade in knowledge-related goods and services are a source of bitter dispute. Creative industries – from entertainment and publishing to textiles and design – occupy an increasingly important place in many national economic strategies. Information technology companies are now among the world's most profitable. And the race to find better, cheaper cures for old and new diseases, develop greener energy sources and support more efficient production processes, has made policies that protect R&D investments and profits a top concern for business strategies. With one recent estimate valuing global IP assets at some US$300 billion, rules on intellectual property have grown rapidly in importance for many businesses over the past decade as they seek to gain legal security over the ownership of such rights and their enforcement. But the global debate over IP rules, and especially over access to affordable medicines, has shown that IP laws can no longer be the domain of a small, specialized community of business lobbyists, IP officials, lawyers and international civil servants. Indeed, tensions over the appropriate rules for managing the creation, use and sharing of knowledge-intensive goods and services now engage a range of stakeholders in a vast and expanding array of global public policy debates, spanning issues as diverse as the environment and climate change, innovation, access to knowledge, education, public health, agriculture, the Internet, creative industries, biodiversity and food security, traditional knowledge, and genetic resources, as well as competition, industrial development, and science and technology. © The Evian Group 2010.

N2  - At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, neither government officials nor members of the news media fully grasped what was happening in the Latino community. Underreporting of COVID-19 cases led to a systematic neglect of the Latino population and resulted in disproportionately high rates of infection, hospitalization, and death. Illinois Unidos was formed to engage in community mobilization, health communication, advocacy, and policy work in response to inequalities exacerbated by COVID-19 in Latino communities in Illinois.

N2  - This chapter looks at how good corporate governance and building robust, strong institutions can help address issues of corruption in the Asia-Pacific. Firstly, this chapter looks at the definitions of corruption, its unpredictability, and different forms of petty and grand corruption after the Rose-Ackerman (2008) model. Corruption's long-lasting effects on poverty are also mentioned. This chapter suggests that corporate governance institutions and their good practice may alleviate the effects of corruption. Corporate governance reforms are described and suggestions are made on how their good practice may strengthen government institutions and promote business investment in countries with weak markets. Finally, this chapter states that institutional-building is an important part of combating corruption, preventing politicization in the organs of government, and promoting socioeconomic well-being in the region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - On May 29, 1998, the New Mexico Supreme Court entered an interlocutory order on the issue of the accepted methods of voting for acequia officials under New Mexico Stature. The court's ruling was only one of several issues before the trial court in the case of Wilson v. Denver in Taos County; however, if was an important decision for all acequia associations in New Mexico. While the legally accepted methods of electing acequia officials is important, the underlying issue when elections are in dispute is clearly actual control over the ditch structure and flow of water in the acequia. Because of ambiguity in the law as written, and because of the historical practices of community acequias in New Mexico, the court ruled that New Mexico recognizes three different methods of electing acequia officials based on ownership interests in the ditch structure, a right to flow of wafer, or by an equal interest in the acequia of all users, as long as the method has historically been the chosen method of election of officials in the particular acequia. The court's ruling, although consistent with prior New Mexico law, fails to take into consideration the other methods historically used by acequia associations in New Mexico to elect officials. The court's opinion inadvertently shows, however, that a uniform system for the election of acequia officials would be most beneficial, especially a method that recognizes the majority ownership interests in an acequia. Prior New Mexico Supreme Court opinions have put acequia associations into the category of ``quasi-corporations,{''} meaning that individuals with majority ownership interests in an acequia should have the controlling interests in an acequia. Case law in other states allows for election of ditch officials in proportion to majority ownership interests. The court's ruling in Wilson v. Denver, although clarifying the New Mexico statute dealing with acequia elections, does not resolve the underlying control issues that must be addressed under New Mexico law. Ultimately, the New Mexico legislature should adopt one method for electing acequia officials that is not only consistent with New Mexico case law and common practice, but that recognizes the interests of those individuals, or groups of individuals, with majority interests in the acequia.

N2  - As one of the most potent hypothesis in political economy, the negative impact of ethnic diversity on the provision of public goods made the welfare state–nation state isomorphism seem a one-way connection. Against the grain of existing studies I argue, through a case-study of interwar Romania, that welfare states are constructed to proactively (re)build the nation, rather than retroactively emanate from it, once established. Rather than an ahistorical ethnolinguistic fractionalization, the article takes nationhood as historically fluid and contested because through institutionalized action, elites can and do proactively revamp the political arena, redistributing coalitions of winners and losers based on exogenously given criteria. The article therefore shows that nation forgers typically internalize the global social question through the topoi of local socio-economic problems construed as a national question. Because elites can pick and choose who becomes part of the national compact, the politicization of the perception of incomplete nationhood provides a sufficient ideational thrust for welfare policymaking, irrespective of pre-existing national solidarities. Consequently, welfare policies are typically layered as remedial or compensatory policies designed to foster a specific social mobility, deemed in a top-down fashion to be completing the nation.

N2  - As political authority shifts to the global level, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) increasingly attempt to influence policy-making within international organisations (IOs). This article examines the nature and sources of non-governmental organisations’ advocacy strategies in global governance. We advance a twofold theoretical argument. First, non-governmental organisation advocacy can be described in terms of inside and outside strategies, similar to interest group lobbying in American and European politics. Second, non-governmental organisations’ chosen combination of inside and outside strategies can be explained by their organisational goals and membership base. Empirically, this argument is corroborated through a large-n analysis of original data from structured interviews with 303 non-governmental organisation representatives active in relation to the United Nations (UN), complemented by 19 semi-structured interviews with UN and state officials. The article’s findings have implications for the theory and practice of non-governmental organisation involvement in global governance.

N2  - Political parties worldwide seek to work with bureaucrats who are close to their programs, willing to cooperate, and concerted. On the other hand, there is a huge body of literature which argues that bureaucracy should be separate from politics and that it has to consist of public servants who are technically knowledgeable, expert, and also politically neutral. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe suffered from highly politicized public administrations under one-party regimes, and have struggled to separate their bureaucracies from politics since early 1990s. In view of the relation between politics and bureaucracy from the perspective of (de) politization, this paper looks into the changes that Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) have gone through after the institutionalization of multi-party regimes and tries to provide some generalizations.

N2  - In this chapter, the interest group theory of legislation is examined in order to develop an explanation for trade policy and rent seeking activities of interest groups in Turkey. The intention is to concentrate on the positive side of the economic theory of legislation, rather than the normative side. In other words, the issues to be considered in this study are not whether a given law is =good' or =bad', but rather how this law was passed. In order to develop a testable economic model of the lobbying behaviour of interest groups in the pursuit of wealth transfers, the demand and supply factors have been developed to generate the volume of legislation in a time series framework in Turkey during the period 1960-2000. We found that there is a long run relationship between business groups, bureaucrats and politicians in trade policy in Turkey. This relationship also explains long term stability among these three interest groups in terms of rent seeking. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The politicization of bureaucracy, which indicates one of the most significant aspects of politics-bureaucracy relations, had been at the center of studies leading to the establishment of Public Administration Discipline, and has always maintained its importance and popularity as a subject matter since the beginning of the 20th century. Though it was used as a synonym of partisanship by Classical Approach, the politicization of bureaucracy, by virtue of Bureaucratic Politics Approach and Principle-Agent Approach that shed light on the different aspects of the politics-bureaucracy relations, gained two new meanings by the 1980s. While first meaning underlines harmony and complementarity between politics-bureaucracy, the second points a responsive and competent bureaucracy. Such a case, as it indicates one single signifier for three signifieds from the point of semiotics, has prevented us to demarcate an obvious distinction between different meanings of the concept. In order to ease analyzing and comprehending, this study, which aims to present three different meanings of the politicization of bureaucracy, claims that these different meanings can be examined via three types of antonyms in linguistics. While first meaning is related with complimentary antonym, second and third are matched with relational antonym and graded antonym respectively.

N2  - Despite attempts to end homelessness in the United States occurring over the past 10 years, homelessness has only been reduced by about 10\%. This article introduces a theoretical model for why some individuals have gained housing and other types of services while others have not. This model incorporates both the political economy theory and the street-level bureaucracy theory to explain service gaps for homeless individuals. Using this model, this article explains major policies affecting agencies which serve the homeless. It also uses current research to explain how practitioners manage these constraints. Recommendations for social service practitioners are discussed.

N2  - Much is known about how to change alcohol policy to reduce harm, but despite the evidence little action has been taken at the national level in the United States. Government officials have shown little interest in putting prevention research results to work. The influence of the alcohol industry on policy-makers combined with free market ideology has thwarted change despite the efforts of advocacy groups working to reduce harm. The role of the alcohol industry at the national and international level serves as a powerful deterrent to policy change.

N2  - We develop a political economy model to analyse the US-Mexican tomato trade agreement by treating the minimum import price as a negotiated settlement. We incorporate the special characteristics of the US-Mexican tomato dispute, namely trade among large countries, the role of competing fresh and processed tomato lobbies, quota revenues accruing to Mexican producers, bargaining for a minimum import price rather than a tariff, and the role of the Canadian tomato market. We show the importance of the size of the lobby group's supply, the weight elected officials' place on national welfare, and the elasticities of export supply and import demand in determining the optimal price wedge. For the United States, larger fresh tomato or cherry-grape tomato supply intensifies the degree of protection awarded to US growers, while US processors work to mitigate this effect. From Mexico's perspective, larger Mexican fresh or cherry-grape output induces a push towards free trade due to the agreement's depressing effect on Mexican prices, while Mexican processors and quota revenues exacerbate the price wedge.

It examines how the interaction between the temporality of party system restructuring and historical legacies rooted in the nature of public bureaucracies reproduced patronage practices aimed at capturing state resources.

N2  - This paper contends that since 2010 in the UK, there has been an unprecedented attempt to disrupt the traditional civil service ‘monopoly’ over policy advice, outsourcing policy-making to actors beyond the central state. The author argues that the policy-making processes of Whitehall and Westminster governance are being radically overhauled. In many Anglophone countries, ministers have sought to reduce their structural dependence on the permanent civil service. In so doing, ministers sought to gain political control over the machinery of policy-making. These efforts to restructure the permanent bureaucracy have had unintended consequences, however. The policy process in the UK state has become more fragmented, as policy-making and implementation have increasingly diverged. IMPACT: Those policy-makers and practitioners who have contact with civil servants and government ministers need to better understand the more fluid and unpredictable policy environment that is emerging at various tiers of UK governance, shaped by a multiplicity of actors sitting within, and outside, the formal boundaries of the state. The diverse ecology of policy-making institutions includes think-tanks, research institutes, non-governmental organizations, charities, community groups, management consultancies, and professional services companies, all of whom are involved in directly providing policy advice to ministers. The ‘monopoly’ over policy-making traditionally enjoyed by the civil service is eroding, with important implications for the work of policy-makers and public managers who have to negotiate the more fractious system of Whitehall bureaucracy. A subtle but perceptible shift is occurring whereby elected politicians and their advisers are gaining greater control over the policy-making processes of the UK state.

N2  - By the early 1990s, the core executive was established as the 'new orthodoxy' in the study of British government at the centre. Thirty years on, this article avers that its main assumptions are increasingly questionable in the light of more recent empirical evidence. The core executive approach may well have outlived its usefulness. This claim is derived from analysis of the Cameron premiership from 2010 to 2016. The focus is on how Whitehall reform radically altered the relationship between politicians and civil servants, reshaping prevailing public service bargains and rules of the game. Ministers identified mechanisms to rebuild political capacity, augmenting partisan control of the bureaucracy. They drew on resources from outside the core executive while politicians increased their sway over civil service appointments. As a result, officials felt they should be 'responsive' to ministers. The cumulative effect was to replace interpersonal and institutional resource dependency with a 'them and us' model. Consequently, the risk of policy disasters and fiascos grew.

N2  - The idea that the Fed is, and ought to be, independent of politics is part of the ideological legacy of the Progressive Era of the early twentieth century. In order to combat the age-old skepticism about government intervention that emanated from the Jeffersonian tradition in American politics (i.e. that government is best which governs least), the Progressives used their positions in academe, journalism, and government to wage a crusade against the spoils system whereby the managers of government enterprises were typically political patronage appointees (Rothbard 1995). In its place, they argued, should be an army of professionally trained (by Progressive intellectuals) bureaucrats who would in theory serve only the public interest, especially if civil service regulations could protect them from political pressures and firings, granting them effective lifetime tenure in their jobs. No longer would the management of government enterprises change hands with every election cycle. That would supposedly assure that government employees would serve the public interest and not private political interest. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose The Scottish Parliament was founded on principles of openness and accessibility and signalled the potential for a new style of politics after devolution. In the aftermath of allegations of political sleaze early in the life of the new institution, the Standards Committee of the Scottish Parliament conducted an inquiry into the registration of lobbyists. This process attracted much comment and criticism from public affairs practitioners and the Scottish media. Based on original empirical research, numerous interviews and first-hand observation, the purpose of this paper is to offer a response to some of these criticisms. Design/methodology/approach The research reported here is based upon extended fieldwork and observation of the developing lobbying industry around the new Scottish Parliament, spanning the period from late 1998 until summer 2003. It involved some 73 interviews with various corporate and voluntary sector lobbyists, public servants and elected representatives. It also draws on participant observation at more than 70 official, public and private meetings for those involved in public affairs in Scotland. In addition, the paper monitored the popular and specialist media in Scotland for news and analyses of issues relating to lobbying at the new Parliament, undertook focus group research to test public opinion on the issue of registration, designed and administered an e-mail survey of public servants in the USA and Canada charged with maintaining registers of lobbyists and conducted archival research at the Scottish Executive's library at Saughton House in Edinburgh. Findings The paper suggests the efforts by parliamentarians to regulate their relations with lobbyists need to be grounded in principles that apply to all outside interests seeking to influence the democratic process. Originality/value The paper challenges the assertions that lobbying is misunderstood by elected representatives and that the lobbying industry is entirely committed to increasing transparency. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

N2  - This article examines the origins and current operation of the EU’s lobbying transparency register and offers a critical review of the drivers and politics associated with lobbying reform in Brussels. The analysis considers the dynamics of political communication in EU institutions and draws on concepts of the fourth estate, the public sphere and monitory democracy to illustrate the particular challenges around lobbying transparency and opening up governance processes to wider scrutiny, and wider participation, at the EU level. This article draws upon interviews, official data and participant observation of some of the deliberations on lobbying transparency dating back to the 2005 ETI. The analysis is brought up to date by examining the data within the Transparency Register itself, both substantively in terms of the kinds of information disclosed and in relation to trends around disclosures and registration, since the register was launched over a decade ago. The article concludes with a critical appraisal of the evolving issue culture relating to lobbying transparency in Brussels as well as recommendations for the development of the Transparency Register itself. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Do clergy approve of official lobbying by their denominations? Using a data set of nearly 2,300 Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and Episcopal Church clergy surveyed in 1998, we investigate how clergy evaluate the work of their official denominational Washington lobbying offices. In particular, we assess the effects of four factors - political ideology, social theology, political engagement, and internal denominational politics-on clergy's evaluations of these Washington offices. We find that clergy evaluations of their Washington office are driven by (1) their own politics, (2) whether they feel it is appropriate for their denomination to pursue political ends, and (3) their support for the general direction of the denomination - not directly connected to the lobby.

N2  - More than ever before, analysts in government have access to policy-relevant research and advocacy, which they consume and apply in their role in the policy process. Academics have historically occupied a privileged position of authority and legitimacy, but some argue this is changing with the rapid growth of think tanks and research-based advocacy organizations. This article documents the findings from a randomized controlled survey experiment using policy analysts from the British Columbia provincial government in Canada to systematically test the source effects of policy research in two subject areas: minimum wage and income-splitting tax policy. Subjects were asked to read research summaries of these topics and then assess the credibility of each article, but for half of the survey respondents the affiliation/authorship of the content was randomly reassigned. The experimental findings lend evidence to the hypothesis that academic research is perceived to be substantially more credible than think tank or advocacy organization research, regardless of its content. That increasingly externalized policy advice systems are not a pluralistic arena of policy research and advice, but instead subject to powerful heuristics that bureaucrats use to sift through policy-relevant information and advice, demands added nuance to both location and content-based policy advisory system models.

N2  - How do key policy professionals inside government view various sources of policy research? Are there systematic differences in the perceptions of the quality and credibility of research derived from different sources? This is a replication of and expansion on Doberstein (2017), which presented a randomized controlled survey experiment using policy analysts to systematically test the source effects of policy research. Doberstein's experimental findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that academic research is perceived to be substantially more credible to government policy analysts than think tank or advocacy organization research, regardless of its content, and that sources perceived as more ideological are much less credible. This study replicates that experiment in three additional Canadian provincial governments to verify whether the relationship found in the original study persists in a larger sample and in conjunction with further randomization procedures. This study corroborates the original study's findings, confirming that external policy advice systems are subject to powerful heuristics that bureaucrats use to sift through evidence and advice.

N2  - In Noel Canning v. NLRB, the D.C. Circuit held that the recess appointment power, which permits the President to ``fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate,{''} extends only to vacancies that arise during the recess between official sessions of the Senate. This Article advances two principal theses. The first is that the restrictions on the recess appointment power articulated in Noel Canning are compelled by the constitutional text. The second is that those restrictions are the only restrictions that the judiciary is in a position to enforce vis-a-vis the President's appointments. As to the first thesis, this Article argues that, because of the cursory nature of the linguistic analysis up to this point, most parties to the debate have become convinced (or perhaps better, have managed to convince themselves) that the text of the Recess Appointment Clause is ambiguous. It is not. First, the debate up until now has proceeded on the assumption that the term ``happen{''} admits of two senses, such that something could be said to ``happen{''} either when it arises or whenever it exists. This Article argues that one can make sense of the relevant linguistic data by attributing to ``happen{''} a single sense, according to which something can be said to ``happen{''} only during the entire period of time during which it exists. Second, critics of Noel Canning have argued that ``the recess{''} as used in the Recess Appointments Clause is ambiguous insofar as it might refer either to some specific recess or to recesses as a kind. This Article suggests that, while it is possible to achieve kind-reference with a definite singular noun phrase, the preconditions for doing so are not met in the context of Article II, Section 2, Clause 3. As to the second thesis, this Article argues that the less sweeping objection levied against the President's appointments, that the period of adjournment during which they were issued was simply too brief to constitute a ``recess,{''} is difficult for a challenger to advance without contradiction, let alone for a court to accept and enforce.

N2  - This contribution discusses the politicization of the civil service system in Kosovo as a framework through which politicians exert influence in the system. The article employs the concept of formal-political discretion, as a means of explaining and elucidating the extent to which both the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and current legislation regulating civil service preconditions/pre-favours the politicization of the senior civil service in Kosovo. It first discusses the concept of politicization based upon current scholarship and gives hints on the way in which these concepts fit with both UNMIK and Kosovo's current situation. Next, the article discusses and compares the previous civil service system built by UNMIK with the current one - built in post-independence Kosovo based upon the formal-political discretion model. The article further argues that the former system of civil service - in contrast to the current system - provided less formal-political discretion to political elites with which to politicize the senior civil service. The article concludes by suggesting that the current post-independence legislation regulating the civil service grants the executive institutions a significant level of formal-political discretion in the appointment, dismissal and promotion of civil servants.Points for practitionersThe articles offers a thorough, both theoretical and practical, policy explanation of the model and structure of Kosovo's civil service, hinting on the previous and current legislative gaps that allow for partisan influence and control. The article also portrays the routes via which the politicization of the civil service in Kosovo is being developed, giving insights on how civil servants perceive such a process. Comparing the previous civil service system with the current one, the article informs practitioners on the directions that the new reform on Kosovo's civil service should take. Finally, the article provides in-depth policy information on the means to redesign the key protection mechanisms of Kosovo's senior civil service management. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - The literature on territorial lobbying in the European Union (EU) has paid much attention to the interaction between regional representations in Brussels and the member-state central governments, and the relations of these representations with the European institutions. Surprisingly, far less systematic research has been conducted on the policies that regional representations prioritize when they lobby in Brussels. In this article, we focus on the policy portfolios of these organizations and analyze variation concerning the domains and issues these regional representations prioritize. Empirically, we demonstrate that the size and the nature of a policy portfolio is not primarily affected by the capabilities of a regional representation, but rather results from structural ties of regional lobbyists with other public and private interests. This claim is corroborated by data collected through a telephone survey with 127 officials from regional offices and trans-regional associations. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

N2  - The last decades have seen a remarkable expansion in the number of International Organizations (IOs) that have mainstreamed environmental issues into their policy scope-in many cases due to the pressure of civil society. We hypothesize that International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs), whose headquarters are in proximity to the headquarters of IOs, are more likely to affect IOs' expansion into the environmental domain. We test this explanation by utilizing a novel dataset on the strength of environmental global civil society in proximity to the headquarters of 76 IOs between 1950 and 2017. Three findings stand out. First, the more environmental INGOs have their secretariat in proximity to the headquarter of an IO, the more likely the IO mainstreams environmental policy. Second, proximate INGOs' contribution increases when they can rely on domestically focused NGOs in member states. Third, a pathway case reveals that proximate INGOs played an essential role in inside lobbying, outside lobbying and information provision during the campaign to mainstream environmental issues at the World Bank. However, their efforts relied to a substantial extent on the work of local NGOs on the ground.

N2  - American accounting histories of the mid-twentieth century have long focused on the development of accounting standards. With the exception of the events surrounding the New Deal, there has been a reliance on memoirs and official histories for analysis of the accounting profession itself. The union corruption scandals and the accounting profession's efforts to involve itself in the reform of unions and pensions offers an opportunity to see how the profession understood and consolidated its franchise in financial statement audits and, perhaps more importantly, how it saw its own place in American society and how its place was viewed by others. This article focuses on the events that led to the passage of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (Landrum-Griffin Act) of 1959, paying particular attention to congressional testimony and the records of congressmen and the Eisenhower administration and the efforts of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to influence the legislation.

N2  - This article explores state court budgetary strategies and their effectiveness in the appropriations process as perceived by key budgeting actors. In general, we find evidence of state judiciaries that try to remain “above politics” when dealing with budget issues. The most important strategies to this effect include submitting realistic requests, providing documentation to support needs, and not using budget “weapons” at their disposal (e.g., writs of mandamus). However, the survey results do indicate that state judiciaries use certain strategies that have a more political tint, such as lobbying by court officials.

N2  - When do personal ties matter? Studies of political elite's rise to power stress the importance of personal ties, but do not consider the possibility of differential effects depending on who one is connected to in elite struggles. We examine how ties formed among Chinese party-state officials influence their career. Our research design provides a strong proxy to account for personal ties: attendance of an exclusive and intensive training program for officials. We take advantage of the exogenous assignment to cohorts in this program to establish a causal link between informal connections and promotions. We find that the effect of personal ties depends on whether the official is connected to the leader who dominates the promotion process or to the one who only influences it through information control. Connections to the latter decrease the promotion probability, likely because these officials are closely monitored by their superiors and more powerful rivals.

N2  - The chapter reviews the literature on the political economy of international organizations (IOs). Considering IOs as products of the preferences of various actors rather than monolithic entities, the authors focus on national politicians, international bureaucrats, interest groups, and voters. By looking into the details of decision-making in IOs, the literature shows that a focus on states as the prime actors in IOs overlooks important facets of the empirical reality. Mainly focusing on empirical research, the authors discuss the four main actors involved and examine how they influence, use, and shape IOs. They find that IO behavior often reflects the interests of politicians, bureaucrats, and interest groups, while the impact of voters is limited. The final section reviews proposals for reforms addressing this weak representation of voter preferences. © Oxford University Press 2019. All rights reserved.

N2  - This article develops a ditty-based theory of executive power. This theory maintains that the Constitution seeks to instill a duty in all executive branch officers to faithfully execute the law. Conversely, the Constitution's Framers and Ratifiers did not intend to empower the President to distinctively shape the law to suit his policy preferences or those of his party. Rather, they envisioned a model of ``disinterested leadership{''} serving rule-of-law values. Because of the Ratifiers' and Framers' interest in preventing abuse of executive power, the Constitution obligates executive branch officials to disobey illegal presidential directives and creates a major congressional role in preventing illegal executive action, primarily by assigning the Senate a major role in appointments and removal. The ditty-based theory fits original intent better than the unitary executive theory popular these days among originalists. Both the constitutional text and the pre-enactment history show a preoccupation with establishing duties, preventing real abuse, and securing stable administration, rather than an effort to establish presidential control over executive branch discretion. The duty-based theory also serves rule-of-law values better than the unitary executive theory. This article closes with a discussion of the theory's implications for key separation of powers issues involving the execution of law.

N2  - Our stylized rent-seeking model of privatization elucidates the empirical problems of making and implementing privatization. We treat privatization as a strategic game with the public enterprise's employees and an outside investor competing for privatized rents by lobbying. At another level, bureaucrats (the privatizing authority) are concerned with social welfare and the resources spent by the contestants. Our two main results establish that increased selfishness of the government reduces the sale price of the company while increasing the probability of privatization and that a budgetary constraint on the employees' lobbying increases the probability of privatization while reducing the sale price. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Multicultural competence includes the ability to negotiate meaning of an ambiguous term with humility and respect. What if the term is advocacy? This article introduces a 3-step technique based on the theory of social representations to examine the meaning and implications of advocacy in the cultural context of Italian psychology compared with the North American guidelines set by the American Psychological Association. Because there is no translation of the term advocacy in Italian, exploration of this particular context appears as especially relevant in light of linking advocacy with multicultural competence. Inspired by the structural approach in social representations research, this article proposes 3 steps: word association, a definition check, and focus on areas of application. A study of the meaning of advocacy with 145 Italian psychologists provides an example of each of the steps. Participants associated advocacy primarily with influence, patronage, and support, as well as promotion, lobby, power, defense, and advertising. Their replies coincided with the official definition provided by an Italian encyclopedia only in terms of support and influence. Priority areas for psychologists' advocacy in Italy are identified as human rights issues; children, youth, and families; and trauma, violence, and abuse. Although on the surface advocacy does not play a vital part of psychological training (with the exception of community psychology graduate programs) or national associations' concerns, in reality, participants are sensitive to what it implies.

N2  - This paper compares and contrasts the behavioral tendencies between civil servants recruited from regular entrance examinations (REEs) and specially selected graduates (SSGs) in grassroots-level governments in China as they face a conflict between vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (public) responsiveness. This study draws on a survey from 13 cities to explore behavioral variations in the two categories of civil servants. Two test methods (the OLS and mediation model) are adopted to verify the findings. This study finds that both the vertical and horizontal responsiveness of civil servants who are SSGs tend to be higher than those recruited from the REEs in facing the above-mentioned conflict. Four personnel mechanisms are tested to explain this variation: (1) the politicized recruitment and selection of SSGs, (2) job arrangements for SSGs, (3) triple leadership over SSGs, and (4) a fast-track stream for SSGs. Our analysis reveals that only the first two can account for this variation. This account can shed new light on the impact of the development of a separate corps of elites in China.

N2  - This study analyzes the political action taken by Argentina’s main foreign multinational corporations during Kirchnerism (2003–2015). Specifically, it focuses on the study of two specific and contradictory actions: public interventions in the press and lobbying National Executive Branch officials. On the basis of an exhaustive empirical work that contemplated the analysis of approximately twenty in-depth interviews, 491 statements in the press by different actors linked to the country’s main multinational companies, and 838 requests for public hearings with officials, we showed that both the firms’ sector of activity and the structure of political opportunities (the relationship with the government, electoral times, among other factors) are essential aspects for understanding the reasons that could lead a foreign company to act politically and, if it does, to prioritize one type of action over the other.

N2  - The bureaucracy of foreign affairs seemed likely to become less streamlined, and more accessible to interest lobbying. This chapter reviews a series of important foreign policy events and decisions of the Bill Clinton years. Plans and agreements for a free trade alliance in North America were be-queathed to Clinton by President Bush. The Congressional Black Caucus, protesting Clinton's reversal of campaign undertakings to admit Haitian refugees, pushed for active policies to restore Aristide. Clinton's activism was explained in some quarters by reference to the 'green' Irish lobby among American Democrats. Clinton inherited from President Bush an attitude of caution towards the ethnic conflict which marked the post-Cold War disintegration of Yugoslavia. The Clinton administration succeeded before 1995 in paring down that total by more than half, with much of the depleted figure going to short-range missile defence, rather than the intercontinental rocket systems.

N2  - One of the remarkable and unique aspects of the recent history of rare disease research has been the evolving role of patient advocacy groups and the collaborative partnership that exists among such groups and the scientists who study rare diseases, as well as the government officials charged with overseeing medical research and regulatory processes. This collaboration, which in many respects developed out of necessity on all sides, is unparalleled in other areas of medical research and product development. It has played a significant role over the past 30 years in the adoption of public policies, available research funding and other factors affecting the general climate for research on rare diseases. Specific areas of interest include the adoption of the Orphan Drug Act in the U.S. in 1983 and subsequent similar legislation elsewhere in the world; the relationship of patient advocacy groups with government research funding and regulatory entities; the role of patient advocacy groups in seeking to ``de-risk{''} orphan product development through initiatives such as facilitating patient registries and disease natural histories; the role of advocacy groups in ensuring that patients have access to treatments; and the increasing globalization of patient advocacy initiatives.

N2  - The New Public Management (NPM) has often been favorably contrasted with European Public Administration (EPA). This paper attempts to balance this Anglo-American perspective with a relatively new European critique of NPM which its authors call the Neo-Weberian State (NWS). Despite their differences in some key respects, however, it is argued that the NPM and NWS are similar in their sweeping paradigmatic character, their ambiguities and internal inconsistencies, their inability to go beyond instrumental rationality and incorporate forms of hermeneutic and critical reason, and in their advocacy of bureaucracy via participation under certain historical conditions, hence consistent with Weber's characterization of modern organization and management. The paper, based on the authors' rendering of critical social theory, provides a fresh means for bridging the two perspectives. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

It also shows how much literature that is relevant to the study of the administrative presidency is being ignored by those who do identify with the study of administrative strategies for advancing presidential policy agendas. It then provides an agenda for future research on the presidentializing of the federal bureaucracy in America. Surveys of federal bureaucrats have advanced the understanding appreciably of the politicization of the Senior Executive Service (SES), and they should continue to play an important role in future research.

N2  - This article identifies what is known, what is not known, and what needs to be studied to inform better both practice and theoretical debates over the efficacy of five major administrative tools: centralizing policy making in the White House, establishing regulatory clearance and program evaluation in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), reorganizing agencies, appointing loyalists to run them, and wielding unilateral tools. The Bush administration's efforts to require OMB clearance of agency guidance documents suggest that centralization pressures may trump decentralization pressures. In general, this article provides a broad overview of some of the most important and promising lines of inquiry for improving the understanding of the promise versus the performance of administrative strategies designed to advance presidential agendas.

N2  - The increased politicization of local government action and civil service employment introduced by the 1987 law puts the concept of secure employment into perspective and changes the career path of senior civil servants at local and regional level. Very quickly concerns about employment overshadowed those regarding one's career, even though this idea is well entrenched in the French civil service. Elected representatives and directors general of services are interdependent, a relationship which has been redefined. This institutional change gives rise to a new approach to exercising the profession of general director of services. Given the higher degree of employment instability for managers of local and regional administrations over the past fifteen years, they have developed adaptive strategies. © E.N.A..

N2  - The standard approach of international organizations (IOs) makes no formal distinctions between nonprofit private sector associations, known as trade or industry groups, and public interest groups like Amnesty International or Greenpeace. After all, these groups are all organized as nonprofits; they may all be characterized as nongovernmental organizations representing the interests of their memberships; and the groups all seek to advance the agendas of members by offering ideas and expertise to international officials or bodies-classic lobbying activity. Thus, most IOs offer accreditation and access to both private sector and public interest groups on equal terms, without differentiating between them. I will call this approach interest blind and use this essay to examine its origins and consequences.

N2  - Corporate influence in government is more than a national issue; it is an international phenomenon. For years, businesses have been infiltrating international legal processes. They secretly lobby lawmakers through front groups: “astroturf” imitations of grassroots organizations. But because this business lobbying is covert, it has been underappreciated in both the literature and the law. This Article unearths the “astroturf activism” phenomenon. It offers an original descriptive account that classifies modes of business access to international officials and identifies harms, then develops a critical analysis of the laws that regulate this access. I show that the perplexing set of access rules for aspiring international lobbyists creates the transparency problem I identify by prohibiting all but covert business access. I argue that the access rules have been rendered obsolete by globalization and fundamental changes in relationships between national governments and multinational business entities. To that historical critique, this Article adds an efficiency account and an evaluation of the law’s conceptual coherence that draws from pluralistic theory. The analysis gives rise to two potential avenues for reform. One proposal would require enhanced disclosures, and the other would offer formal access to business entities, engaging business input but also exposing it. Either potential reform would update the law to better accommodate contemporary business roles in international governance. The stakes, I show, are high. On the one hand, business can offer lawmakers expertise and politically neutral solutions. On the other hand, unchecked business influence can obstruct and neutralize laws aimed at solving critical global problems. © 2017, Stanford Law School. All rights reserved.

N2  - An idiosyncratic array of international rules allows “consultants” to gain special access to international officials and lawmakers. Historically, many of these groups were public-interest associations like Amnesty International. For this reason, the access rules have been celebrated as a way to democratize international organizations, enhancing their legitimacy and that of the rules they produce. But a focus on the classic public-law virtues of democracy and legitimacy produces a theory at odds with the facts: The international rules rules also offer access to industry an d trade associations like the World Coal Association, whose principal purpose is to lobby for their corporate clients. The presence of these corporate lobbyists challenges the conventional view, which I call strong legitimacy optimism, by focusing a set of longstanding critiques: Nonstate groups are not always representatives of the “global public” and access is not robust participation in governance. Moreover, the rules both overregulate and underregulate access to lawmakers. This critique is particularly salient in the context of business lobbying, where the rules do not balance the costs and benefits of business access to international lawmaking and governance. This Article introduces a theory of international lobbying law. Reframing the international access rules as a body of lobbying regulations delivers explanatory and normative payoffs by identifying (1) the full array of actors who obtain access (public interest and private sector alike); (2) the quantum of access that the current system delivers (informal lobbying, not participation in governance); and (3) new regulatory strategies. Specifically, two regulatory models emerge. One draws on the flawed but best-available registration and disclosure norms of domestic lobbying regulation. The other is a multistakeholder model pioneered by twenty-first-century public-private partnership organizations. The Article develops an original typology to organize and identify features of the international access rules across diverse international organizations, thereby clarifying the regulatory tradeoffs that accompany each choice. Perhaps counterintuitively, reformers should likely eschew the most common middle-of-the-road access models—which are grounded in the flawed legitimacy optimism view—and instead choose among the two divergent regulatory models, with that choice driven by organizational mission. © 2018, Cogitatio Press.

N2  - Debates about the Appointments Clause tend to turn on drawing the right
distinctions. This Article argues that the Appointments Clause draws a
little-recognized distinction between the officers specifically
enumerated by the Clause ({''}Ambassadors,{''} ``other public Ministers
and Consuls,{''} and ``Judges of the supreme Court{''}) and the officers
referred to only as a residual category ({''}all other officers of the
United States{''}). The basic claim is that enumerated offices need not
be ``established by Law `` that is, by congressional legislation but are
established instead by the Constitution or the law of nations.
Although the ``enumerated-residual distinction{''} has been essentially
ignored by judges and scholars, it raises a basic interpretive puzzle.
The Appointments Clause appears to give the President the same authority
to appoint each category of enumerated officers. But in practice, we
have construed the President's authority to appoint diplomats and
Supreme Court Justices quite differently. Since the Founding, the
President has appointed diplomats without congressional authorization,
but at the same time everyone has assumed that Congress must pass a
statute before the President may appoint any Justices.
This Article argues that the President has the authority to appoint both
diplomats and Justices without congressional authorization. This view
accords with the Constitution's text, suits the unique constitutional
status of the Supreme Court, and was advanced by political actors soon
after the Constitution's ratification. But even if one rejects the
strongest version of this argument, the Article's core insight that the
Appointments Clause requires parallel treatment of diplomats and
Justices has a series of potential implications for constitutional
doctrine.

N2  - Objective: Corporations spend significant resources lobbying for billions of dollars in federal procurement contracts, yet this important opportunity to assess the political influence of business has gone unstudied by scholars of business politics. We study it here. Methods: We approach it by analyzing the influence of direct lobbying of five federal departments, along with data on the lobbying of, and campaign contributions to, members of Congress on patterns of contract awards broken out by congressional districts. Results: Our analysis reveals that while there are many reasons to expect lobbying Congress to produce valuable contracts, we instead find that it is the direct lobbying of executive branch agencies that is most likely to bring big rewards. Conclusion: These results highlight the importance of studying corporate political power outside of the legislative branch, suggesting that it is the long-term relationships that lobbyists build with bureaucrats that yield the most lucrative contracts.

N2  - This book examines the development of business interest representation in the postcommunist countries of Eastern Europe and Eurasia. The central argument is that abusive regulatory regimes discourage the formation of business associations. at the same time, poor regulatory enforcement tends to encourage associational membership growth. Academic research often treats special interest groups as vehicles of protectionism and non-productive collusion. This book challenges this perspective with evidence of market-friendly activities of industry associations as well as their benign influence on patterns of public governance. Careful analysis of cross-national quantitative data that spans more than 25 countries, as well as the qualitative examination of the development of business associations in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Croatia, shows that postcommunist business associations function as substitutes for state and private mechanisms of economic governance. They challenge corrupt bureaucracy and contribute to the establishment of effective and predictable regulatory regimes. These arguments and empirical findings put the long-standing issues of economic regulations, public goods, and collective action in a new theoretical perspective.

N2  - Decisions over state assistance to firms can hinge on whether politicians choose a strategy that favors particular interest groups, targets aggregate economic performance, or both. Which types of firms are more likely to receive financial help from the government? While standard interest group based explanations tend to see special interests dominating the political process, extraordinary economic challenges, such as financial crises, may make general economic concerns a greater priority for politicians. We argue that during financial crisis, politicians - who are always concerned with the economy - are even more likely to prioritize broad economic growth over helping particular groups. Politicians should favor general economic strategies over helping specific groups of firms because they have limited resources and wish to avoid sending a bad signal to other firms about helping those that fail. Using 2010 World Bank firm-level surveys done in Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Turkey, we find that politicians favored small dynamic firms with a proven ability to use resources well rather than the largest employers, those firms with the greatest lobbying capacity, or firms in particular sectors. We optimistically conclude that interest groups with disproportionate resources will not always get special treatment at the expense of others.

N2  - Many studies have identified a line of influence between interest group lobbying and the federal bureaucracy's implementation of public policy. These works, however, have often focused on the influence of individual groups rather than coalitional efforts, which compose the majority of lobbying. Assessing this activity is critical to understanding the role of public participants in administrative policymaking. I test the influence of diverse coalitions of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs by analyzing a new dataset of organizations' co-signed public comments across nearly 350 federal agency rules proposed between 2005 and 2015. I find that agencies favor recommendations from organizationally diverse coalitions, and not coalitions that are bipartisan or dominated by business interests. Further, I find that coalition influence is heightened when lobbying in coalitions that are larger in size and more well-resourced, and when policy salience is low. I conclude that diverse lobbying coalitions help bureaucrats to shape the direction and content of regulatory law. This conclusion further establishes the role of organizational participants in bureaucratic policymaking and contributes to the debate over democratic legitimacy in the administrative state.

N2  - The nations of South Asia were the first among the developing countries to receive their independence from the British, immediately after World War II. These nations share a common administrative style and bureaucratic culture, which flow from their imperial legacy. However, a quick mapping expedition reveals the presence and resilience of the classical administrative style of India, which continued to be present until the end of the 12 th Century, in spite of repeated invasions from Alexander the Great to those of the Scythians, Huns, Afghans and Turks. This was modified somewhat when Mohamed Ghuri established Muslim rule in the region. Thereafter, the five centuries of Muslim governance were followed by 200 years of British rule. Thus, there emerged, in South Asia, a high degree of convergence between the ancient Hindu culture and subsequent Islamic and Christian values systems. As a consequence of this, the administrative tradition of India and its neighbours shows three distinct characteristics: persistence from classical times, convergence with the Islamic and Christian mores and patterns, as well as some divergence in the wake of independence. This chapter examines these features. It also explores the challenges which the countries of the region face today. Foremost among them are politicisation of the bureaucracy, the need to fight corruption and the difficulty of reforming entrenched bureaucratic procedures. The chapter concludes by suggesting that, despite these daunting challenges, the process of modernisation is slowly taking hold and opening new prospects for a vibrant, inclusive and empowered India and neighbouring South Asian states.

N2  - In early March 1919 the government of Ignacy Paderewski established the office of General Delegate of the Government for Galicia. This ended a stage of provisional management of the post-Austrian district, which resulted from political and systemic changes in the first months of the independent Polish state's existence. New structures of authority, such as the Polish Liquidation Commission or the Ruling Commission, emerged in opposition to the Polish administration of Austrian times and were based on political and civic rather than professional factors. This complicated the situation so much that the administration of Malopolska by the government in Warsaw became difficult. The appointment of Kazimierz Galecki as the General Delegate of the Government for Galicia and placing the official structures from the Austrian times at his disposal stabilised administrative relations in the lands of former Galicia, strengthening the authority of the reborn Polish state.

N2  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth experience significant bullying that undermines their mental and physical health. National health organizations have called for the development of innovative strategies to address LGBTQ bullying. Pediatricians and other clinicians, medical and public health students, interdisciplinary researchers, government officials, school leaders, community members, parents, and youth from around the country came together at a national symposium entitled "LGBTQ Bullying: Translating Research to Action to Improve the Health of All Youth" in May 2016 to generate strategies to prevent LGBTQ bullying and meet the needs of LGBTQ youth experiencing bullying. This article describes key scientific findings on bullying, LGBTQ stigma, and LGBTQ bullying interventions that were shared at the symposium and provides recommendations for pediatricians to address LGBTQ bullying via clinical care, research, interventions, and policy. Symposium participants recommended that pediatricians engage in efforts to foster inclusive and affirming health care environments wherein LGBTQ youth feel comfortable discussing their identities and experiences, identify youth experiencing LGBTQ bullying, and prevent the negative health consequences of bullying among youth. Moreover, pediatricians can attend to how multiple identities (eg, sexual orientation, gender identity, race and/or ethnicity, disability, and others) shape youth experiences of bullying and expand intervention efforts to address LGBTQ bullying in health care settings. Pediatricians can further advocate for evidence-based, antibullying policies prohibiting bullying on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Collaboration between pediatricians and diverse stakeholders can contribute to the development and implementation of lasting change in all forms of bullying, including LGBTQ bullying. © 2017 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - In the United States, an important literature shows that legislators use interest groups, courts, and budgets to assert political control over bureaucrats. Similar theories can be applied to study the scores of new democracies that have emerged in recent decades. In Argentina, politicians in the first administration of Carlos Menem (1989-95) rewrote administrative procedures and relied on both "police patrol" and "fire alarm" oversight to realign the behavior of tax bureaucrats in conformance with their own policy preferences. Whereas U.S. legislators generally prefer complex administrative procedures, different electoral incentives led their Argentine counterparts to support reforms that significantly streamlined those procedures. This finding challenges theories that attribute legislators bureaucratic preferences to the separation or fusion of powers between the executive and legislative branches.

N2  - Accountability and transparency are the buzz words of development today. However, in any developing countries, where pro-people development is still largely planned and implemented by the state and its bureaucracy, their realisation is a major challenge. One important development in this context has been the use of social audits. A social audit is a process in which details of the resources, both financial and non-financial, used by public agencies for development initiatives are shared with the people, often through a public platform. Social audits allow people to enforce accountability and transparency, providing the ultimate users of services and projects with an opportunity to scrutinise development initiatives. It is a form of citizen advocacy based on the power of knowledge and is grounded in the right to information. Social audits to check working conditions in production facilities emerged in the mid-1990s after a number of high profile companies were widely scrutinized for substandard working conditions in their supply chains. At that time, a growing number of companies-for example Nike, Gap, Levi Strauss, and C & A-had adopted codes of conduct that in essence were pledges to prevent exploitation and abuse of workers producing their goods. Labour advocates soon challenged these companies to demonstrate conformity to the standards they had adopted. Calls for independent, civil society based forms of workplace assessments were made. The article was focused on social audit and its relevance to audit the social performance of the organization. Social auditing is a process that enables an organization to assess and demonstrate its social, economic, and environmental benefits and limitations. It is a way of measuring the extent to which an organization lives up to the shared values and objectives it has committed itself to. Social auditing provides an assessment of the impact of an organization's non-financial objectives through systematically and regularly monitoring its performance and the views of its stakeholders. Social auditing requires the involvement of stakeholders. This may include employees, clients, volunteers, funders, contractors, suppliers and local residents interested in the organization. Social audits are generated by the organization themselves and those directly involved. A person or panel of people external to the organisation undertakes verification of the social audit's accuracy and objectivity. The concept of integrated social audit does not merely extend horizontally in the sense of extending to peripheral events which impinge on the social welfare activity under evaluation. This article describes about what is social auditing, what does social auditing involve, social obligations and social welfare programmes, social obligations of public utilities and problems faced by social audit.

N2  - Politicization has an ambivalent reputation among public administration scholars. While considered an effective instrument to safeguard political control over ministerial bureaucracy, partisanship of senior civil servants is likewise associated with patronage and is deemed detrimental to professionalism and meritocracy. To scrutinize this contradiction, the article examines how the party-political background of senior civil servants influences their decision-making behaviour. Two theoretically derived conceptions of loyalty are therefore put to the test: responsiveness and responsibility. Effects are captured by using the vignette technique in 40 in-depth interviews with former senior civil servants from ministerial departments at federal and state level in Germany. The results are surprising in so far as they reveal that politicized senior civil servants act neither more responsively nor less responsibly than their non-politicized peers. These findings challenge common assumptions and call for a more refined analysis of the conditions under which politicization leads to negative effects.

N2  - The influence of senior civil servants' (SCS) tasks on their role perceptions has been widely ignored in the past research on the administrative elite. This paper presents new survey data on SCS in German federal ministries to test this relation by categorizing SCS into three task-related groups: strategists, policy specialists and administrators. Regression analyses reveal that SCS's tasks do not influence their (strong) identification with reactive (supportive) roles but have a significant impact on their identification with active, more politically entrepreneurial roles. This entails two important findings: First, SCS's tasks matter for their appreciation of different roles. Second, active and reactive role models are not irreconcilable (as it is often argued in the literature on bureaucratic politicization), but complementary.

N2  - International organizations (I0) have centralized their public communication to a large extent over recent decades by undertaking a broader codification of communication tasks as well as a departmentalization of these tasks within units of IO bureaucracies. The paper provides the first systematic analysis of this important development in institutional design using a novel data set on the organization of public communication in 48 IOs between 1950 and 2015. It identifies self-legitimation as a key driver of centralization in the face of increased levels of politicization, that is, public awareness and activism directed at IOs. Empirically, the study suggests that the centralization of public communication significantly increases as transnational civil society organizes and gains access to IO decision-making. Further, politicization in terms of contentious activism and public scandals substantially accounts for varying levels of centralization across IOs.

N2  - Bureaucratic representation theory holds that civil servants are not
``neutral{''} in a Weberian sense. Bureaucrats are thought to
``actively{''} represent their communities by trying to make them better
off. This article proposes an alternative understanding of individual
behavior in representation that emphasizes knowledge sharing instead of
patronage, but leads to similar outcomes: Their societal background
provides officials with advanced social knowledge about the group(s)
they represent, including both informational knowledge (facts about
culture, history, politics) and relational knowledge (how people
interact). Bureaucratic knowledge linkage is the process of sharing
information and managing relations internally and with citizens. An
extreme case serves to illustrate knowledge linkage empirically: Survey
data from an international organization yield high levels of knowledge
asymmetries within staff bodies and subsequent observation of knowledge
linkage mechanisms. In generalizing findings, the risks (knowledge
distortions) and benefits (attaining public value) of knowledge linkage
are discussed for both international and domestic administrations.

N2  - The article argues that the 'crisis of Europe', triggered by market and governance dysfunctionalities (summarized as the Euro crisis), represents a 'critical moment' in the evolution of a European society. This society so far does not offer much resistance to such critical moments which is due to its incapacity to form a demos capable of acting together. The existing European society - and this is the basic claim - is nothing but the sum of individuals living in 'sub-European' (mainly national) groups. The evolution triggered by this critical situation opens pathways to turn these peoples of Europe into something more than being a sum of peoples governed by supranational bureaucracies. To decipher such processes a model is presented using Hirschman's idea of exit, voice and loyalty as mechanisms to generate social ties. Two points arise as crucial. The first is the observation that national societies which continue to provide foundational claims for people have turned into interest groups in the context of the European Union. This undermines not only the ontological nationalism still dominating the self-presentation of national societies in Europe, but it also offers evolutionary paths towards a society beyond national foundational claims in Europe. Yet it also provokes reactive processes such as the return to the self-contained nation (or even ethnic group). This is the core of the crisis of Europe. The systemic crises of the state and the market in Europe are speeding up an evolutionary process of people-making, the outcome of which could be either the regression to a people with foundational identities or to a people without foundational identities. The latter will be described as a postnational society, which would make an emerging European society the first really modern society. © The Author(s) 2014.

N2  - Officials within parliaments have received marginal scholarly attention. This also holds for the European Parliament (EP) which contains a considerable administration. This study, based on an online survey (N = 118), shows that political group staff are primarily committed to the concerns of their respective political groups, but also to the arguments of those external actors which have similar party affiliation. Since most group officials are, in addition, affiliated to a particular committee, they also emphasize sectoral interests, including the concerns of affected interest groups. EP secretariat officials, on the other hand, give priority to sectoral and expert concerns. Both groups of staff rank European concerns above national ones, and pay more attention to the arguments of the European Commission than to the arguments of any other institution. This study thus suggests that officials in the EP contribute to the spanning of ideological and sectoral cleavages across European Union institutions. These observations may be seen as deviating from a basically intergovernmental portrayal of the Union.

N2  - Much of the lobbying process is inherently competitive: when lobbyists with opposing goals attempt to move outcomes in their preferred direction, successful lobbying by one actor will disadvantage opposing actors. This article theorizes and quantifies the indirect form of influence that competing lobbying actors exert on each other. While existing theories of competitive lobbying have focused on legislation, we argue that all stages of the lobbying process involve competition. Our findings make two contributions to the study of lobbying influence. First, using spatial econometrics, we present the first estimates of how the success of one lobbying actor is shaped by the lobbying activities of opposing actors. Second, we study competition in three diverse empirical settings that capture three different stages of the lobbying process: (1) lobbying camps favoring opposite legislative outcomes in five European countries, (2) US lobbying firms competing over client resources, and (3) corporations competing for administrative trade barriers in 19 World Trade Organization member countries. The results reveal important insights about how interdependence among lobbyists conditions their effectiveness. Our application of spatial techniques to model interdependence between actors is useful for all scholars who want to take competitive or collaborative diffusion mechanisms into account in studies of lobbying and public policy.

N2  - Do Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucrats represent the general public or are they more in line with an interest group? We study preferences for environmental policy using a choice experiment (CE) on three populations; the general public, Swedish EPA bureaucrats, and recreational anglers. We also test for existence of multiple preference orderings: Half of the respondents were asked to choose the alternatives that best corresponded with their opinion, and the other half was asked to take the role of a policy-maker and make recommendations for environmental policy. The SEPA bureaucrats have the highest marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) to improve environmental quality. Differences in MWTP are robust and not due to differences in socio-economic characteristics across the populations. We only found weak evidence of multiple preference orderings.

N2  - In recent times much has been made of the threat some argue is posed by
political advisers to the impartiality of the Westminster civil service.
Drawing on survey of senior New Zealand civil servants, this article
examines the degree to which political advisers are perceived as a
threat to civil service neutrality and describes the form taken by that
threat as variously perceived. On the evidence reported, it is suggested
that traditional understandings of ``politicization{''} need to be
reconceptualized if they are to fully account for the nature of the
relationship between political and civil service advisers. To existing
conceptions of politicization, therefore, the article proposes adding
another: ``administrative politicization,{''} allowing for different
gradations of politicization to be identified, and enabling a nuanced
assessment of the nature and extent of a risk to civil service
neutrality that, the data suggest, is not as great as is sometimes
alleged.

N2  - The Supreme Court appointments process is broken, and the timing couldn't be worse--for liberals or conservatives. The Court is just one more solid conservative justice away from an ideological sea change--a hard-right turn on an array of issues that affect every American, from abortion to environmental protection. But neither those who look at this prospect with pleasure nor those who view it with horror will be able to make informed judgments about the next nominee to the Court--unless the appointments process is fixed now. InThe Next Justice, Christopher Eisgruber boldly proposes a way to do just that. He describes a new and better manner of deliberating about who should serve on the Court--an approach that puts the burden on nominees to show that their judicial philosophies and politics are acceptable to senators and citizens alike. And he makes a new case for the virtue of judicial moderates.Long on partisan rancor and short on serious discussion, today's appointments process reveals little about what kind of judge a nominee might make. Eisgruber argues that the solution is to investigate how nominees would answer a basic question about the Court's role: When and why is it beneficial for judges to trump the decisions of elected officials? Through an examination of the politics and history of the Court, Eisgruber demonstrates that pursuing this question would reveal far more about nominees than do other tactics, such as investigating their views of specific precedents or the framers' intentions.

N2  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been touted as a cure for almost every malady afflicting developing societies. Western governments, international organizations and regional activists expect NGOs to help fill the gap left by underfunded, ineffective state bureaucracies. NGOs are viewed as antidotes to authoritarian and corrupt rule and considered more efficient providers of social services than beleaguered governments. In the Middle East, NGOs are also thought to be potential catalysts for significant social and political change in the region, hastening its transition to democracy. Nowhere in the Middle East have expectations of NGOs been as high as in Egypt. And nowhere else do they command such vast resources and prestige. The past 15 years have seen a dramatic rise of a new type of NGO. Unlike traditional NGOs that provide social services and charity, and which are usually based on voluntary participation, the new 'professional NGOs' strive for social and political change. While some 'professional NGOs' do provide social services, they often integrate issues of empowerment into their work and methodologies. Another group of professional NGOs prioritizes issues such as democratization, women's issues and human rights. These 'advocacy NGOs' are trying to accomplish-with the help of generous foreign funding-what weak political parties, co-opted unions and state-controlled syndicates could not. But how does the record of Egyptian advocacy NGOs compare with the exalted expectations placed upon them? How successful have they been in advancing the cause of social and political change in the Arab world's largest nation? The experience of the last ten years has shown that advocacy NGOs' ability to effect meaningful political and social change is rather limited. Tackling their own political struggles as well as complying with donors' agendas has strained these NGOs' ability to fulfill their mission. In addition, their outspokenness and increasing numbers have provoked a backlash from the Mubarak administration, further compromising their ability to challenge the State's prerogatives.

N2  - The United States is the only country in the world where voters elect prosecutors. But the American prosecutor did not start as an elected official. After the Revolutionary War, most states gave their governors, judges, or legislators the power to appoint prosecutors. Starting with Mississippi in 1832, however, states adopted new constitutions, statutes, or amendments that made prosecutors elected officials. By 1861, nearly three-quarters of the states in the Union elected their prosecutors. This Note is the first detailed study of when, how, and why American state and local prosecutors became elected officials. It shows that fairness and efficiency concerns were largely absent from the debates over whether to make prosecutors elected. Instead, supporters of elected prosecutors were responding to governors and legislators who used the appointment system for political patronage. As prosecutors gained discretionary power over criminal prosecutions, midnineteenth- century political reformers believed it was crucial to remove prosecutors from partisan politics. Many also hoped elected prosecutors would be more accountable to the voters and the local communities they served. Not long after prosecutors became elected, however, prosecutors quickly became involved in and co-opted by partisan politics.

N2  - Many institutions are the result of an interaction between government and business actors, but none are as clear as the creation of a preferential trade agreement. In the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks, officials are attempting to create an agreement that will link together at least eleven countries in three continents at differing levels of economic development. For member states Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam, the final result should reflect the interests of a diverse set of businesses. Since these interests are often competing, officials have a difficult job balancing these domestic demands with the needs and requirements of the other partners. This chapter highlights some of the trade-offs necessary to satisfy both business and political interests across the partner states in creating a new institution from scratch.

N2  - This Article examines the departmental structure of the executive branch, which facilitates, channels, and delimits the exercise of executive power. This structure is grounded in the text of the Constitution, which refers to "Department[s]" in the Necessary and Proper Clause, Appointments Clause, and Opinion Clause. The concept of the department also played a key role in the Framers' constitutional theory of checks and balances. Public law has implemented the scheme that constitutional text and theory outlined. Legislation, case law, and executive branch practice have constructed departments within the executive branch as durable repositories of authority that distribute and rationalize power. Departmental protections against official arbitrariness have been tested in recent events, such as the Special Counsel Investigation, the effort to add a citizenship question to the census, and controversies concerning the leadership of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The departmental structure of executive power must be maintained with renewed investments from each of the constitutional branches.

N2  - There is a sharp contrast between the public value discourse that typifies smart city-making on the one hand and its democratic deficit on the other. In this article we explore this contrast in more detail and assess that the paradigm and practices of networked government, which dominates smart city making, positions citizens as "audiences" of smart city makers and civil servants as "shepherds" of their public values. In these positions, both citizens and civil servants participate in a wide array of smart city experiments and engagements. However, an active, autonomous agenda setting role by citizens or democratically legitimated advocacy of civil servants is rare and does not easily fit within the paradigm of networked government. We draw on the work of Dewey and Marres to envision such different roles and make them concrete by highlighting experiences of Dutch citizens and civil servants with urban data and technology. These show, first, that the desires and goals of citizens may differ markedly from those of the smart city, and-second-that civil servants struggle with legitimate ways to advocate for socially and economically balanced smart city solutions. We conclude, in the final section, that the smart city can only be developed further through representative democratic means of engagement, among which local elections that express the collective desires of citizens and frame the mandate of civil servants.

N2  - In 1978, top DOJ officials in the Carter Administration floated a
revolutionary proposal that would have remade the consumer class action
and, with it, the relationship of litigation and administration in the
American regulatory state. At the proposal's core was a ``public
action{''} for widespread small-damages claims that sought to replace
Rule 23 with a hybrid public-private enforcement model. Similar to the
False Claims Act, this new mechanism would have granted private
plaintiffs the power to bring lawsuits on behalf of the United States
and recover a finder's fee if successful, but it also gave the DOJ
substantial screening authority and control over such actions, including
the ability to take over suits or dismiss them outright. Despite months
of shuttle diplomacy among interest groups, a pair of bills in Congress,
and full-scale committee hearings, this creative blend of private
initiative and public oversight soon fizzled. Yet the story of the
proposal's rise and fall nonetheless provides a venue for wider
reflection about American civil procedure and the political economy that
produces it. Indeed, the failed revolution of 1978 reveals a contingent
moment when the American litigation system was splintering into the
pluralistic, chaotic one we now take for granted, including
hard-charging state attorneys general, a federal administrative state
with litigation authority independent of the DOJ, and a sophisticated
and politically potent plaintiffs' bar. In retrospect, the proposal may
have been the last best chance to counter the centrifugal tendencies of
an American state that was progressively empowering ever more
institutional actors within the litigation system. Just as important,
lurking in the background of the story of 1978 is the bracing
possibility that the Rules Enabling Act, for all its virtues in revising
technocratic procedural rules, has systematically enervated efforts to
address larger procedural design questions in an increasingly dense and
interconnected regulatory world.

N2  - The paper argues that for political reasons elected politicians are more likely to be engaged in targeted redistribution than appointed bureaucrats. It uses the example of patronage jobs in the U.S. local governments to provide empirical support for this claim. It shows that the number of public employees is higher for elected chief executives. This difference is stronger in public services with bigger private-public wage differential and it increases during election years. It also finds that the number of public employees increases with the age of bureaucrats while there is no such relationship in the case of politicians, which is consistent with younger bureaucrats having stronger career concerns.

N2  - Legally independent central banks leave elected politicians with little direct control over monetary policy. The most important indirect channel of influence for governments thus consists in appointing 'responsive' central bank officials and removing 'hostile' ones. This premise is tested by examining the effect of partisan ties between central bank governors and governments or presidents in 30 European democracies between 1945 and 2012. Drawing on an original dataset containing information on the party affiliations of 195 governors, event history models are employed to show that affiliation with a party represented in the executive (the government or the presidency) has a large and significant positive effect on governor survival. However, affiliation with an opposition party only increases governors' hazards during the first four years of their term, suggesting that the impact of the party label may be overridden as more reliable information about a governor becomes available. © 2013 European Consortium for Political Research.

N2  - This paper explores four potential motivations for the party politicization of the senior civil service: ideological agreement, coalition governance, party family issue priorities, and consociational representation. Using data on the party affiliation of 134 secretaries-general (SGs) serving in the Dutch ministerial bureaucracy between 1945 and 2013, it examines the partisan logic of appointment patterns among senior civil servants in the Netherlands. Overall levels of politicization are very high (almost 70 percent of all SGs have a discernible party affiliation), with a strong increase between 1970 and 1990 and a slight drop-off during the past decades. The appointment patterns suggest that the main drivers behind the party politicization of the Dutch elite bureaucracy are the demand for ideological agreement and a consociational quest for the representation of the 'pillar parties' in the senior civil service.

N2  - The degree of rent dissipation is studied in extended two-sided contests that involve two types of efforts. While usual contestants expend resources in trying to win the contested prize, potential recipients of the rent-seeking efforts also participate in the contest. This is due to uncertainty regarding the source of power in the contest that induces the bureaucrats to expend resources to increase their share in the rent-seeking efforts by trying to appear as the party controlling the allocation of the prize. We show that the existing theoretical and empirical studies are incomplete and may underestimate the extent of rent dissipation.

N2  - This chapter argues the different strands of the argument and offers an outlook for the longer-term trajectory of the outsourcing of military support services. It offers a conceptual toolbox to study the policy process which draws on the Advocacy Coalition Framework and Policy Network Theory. It then presents the historical trajectory of supplying the US and UK armies, the rules of admission to the relevant policy networks, that is the mechanisms that determine who participates in making acquisition policy. The chapter looks at the defence services acquisition policy networks, discuss their strong bias towards business’, and explores the bias’s main implications. The policy process involves a complex set of actors who interact over long periods of time on a particular policy issue. The literature on defence policy-making does not really offer approaches that would be able to include contractors either, at least none that can be applied to several countries because they are typically designed for specific states or bureaucracies. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Joakim Berndtsson and Christopher Kinsey.

N2  - The article provides a critical discussion of the literature on 'patrimonialism' and 'neopatrimonialism' in Development Studies in general and African Studies in particular. Based on Max Weber's concept of patrimonialism and legal-rational bureaucracy the authors present their own definition of 'neopatrimonialism'. Three key conceptual questions are addressed. These are related to the operationalisation of the concept in empirical research: (1) how can neopatrimonialism be delimited vis-à-vis the concepts 'clientelism' and 'patronage'? (2) how can neopatrimonialism be 'measured'? and (3) how does neopatrimonialism relate to classical typologies of political regimes?

N2  - To build its many unprecedented bureaucracies, the American New Deal heavily relied upon recent graduates of elite law schools, in a break with prior practice and to the increasing annoyance of congressmen and senators. To head off an attempt to entrust the selection of government lawyers to the Civil Service Commission, in January 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed a committee, chaired by Stanley Reed and including two other Supreme Court Justices, Felix Frankfurter and Frank Murphy, to study the question. In April 1941, he accepted the recommendation of the lawyers on the ``Reed Committee'' and created the Board of Legal Examiners, headed by Solicitor General Francis Biddle (soon replaced by Charles Fahy) and managed during its first, crucial year by Herbert Wechsler, who was on leave from the Columbia Law School. As conceived especially by Frankfurter, the Board's mission was to create an American counterpart to the British Civil Service, in which lawyers advanced to increasingly important posts throughout the executive branch. Although wartime conditions hampered the Board, it administered a national exam that provided greater access to government jobs than had the New Deal's version of an ``old boys network,'' which drew heavily upon the law faculties of Harvard, Columbia, and Yale. Congressional hostility persisted, however, and was joined by the opposition of a powerful veterans' lobby. The Board's response to this pressure is instructive for a time when government lawyers and other professionals are being denounced as members of an anti-democratic, Deep State.

N2  - The literature on voter turnout focuses on the determinants of the electorate's vote supply. There is growing recognition, however, that the demanders of votes-candidates, political parties, and interest groups-have strong incentives to invest resources in mobilizing support on Election Day. The authors test the hypothesis that corruption rents increase the value of holding public office and, hence, elicit greater demand-side effort in building winning coalitions. Analyzing a pooled time-series data set of public officials convicted of misusing their offices between 1979 and 2005, we find, after controlling for other influential factors, that governmental corruption raises voter turnout rates in gubernatorial elections.

The Consortium associates itself with local government officials, social movements and political parties that are interested not only in making use of the existing so-called democratic spaces but also of the political empowerment of the poor. It does so by creating community capabilities for increased bargaining power vis-à-vis local elected officials, reversing the exclusionary logic of patronage politics in the country and supporting co-production and co-financing between local governments and communities willing to put efforts towards solving their own problems. © Institute of Development Studies.

N2  - Public policy has created an ``aging enterprise,'' which assures that the needs of older adults will be processed and treated as a commodity (e. g., medical services) and sold for a profit. The aging enterprise is composed of `` the programs, organizations, bureaucracies, interest groups, trade associations, providers, and professionals that serve elders in one capacity or another. Major components include physicians, hospitals, the Social Security Administration, the Administration on Aging, state and area agencies on aging, congressional committees on aging, and the nursing home and insurance industries'' (Estes, 1979). The primary beneficiary of this enterprise is the medical industrial complex, which comprises the most well-funded part of the aging enterprise. The medical industrial complex operates largely in the private (increasingly proprietary) sector, and is heavily subsidized by the federal government through Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable Care Act (ACA) policy and financing (Estes, 1979, 1986, and 1992; Estes and Associates, 2001). Old age, aging, and the policies designed to ``treat'' this stage of life are shaped by four social processes of consequence to our society: the bio-medicalization of aging; the commodification of aging; the privatization of old-age policy; and, the rationalization of old-age policy (Estes, 1991). These policies and services for older people are embedded in and reflective of larger trends in American life and society. Market ideologies and an ongoing shift to individual responsibility have accelerated and increased public costs through privatization and health and human services profits (Estes, 1991). The mini-history of this state of affairs begins with the 1965 passage of Medicare and Medicaid, and the well-documented government subsidies for the largely private (and lucrative) ``American health empire'' (Ehrenreich and Ehrenreich, 1970). Today, medical care accounts for 18 percent of the U. S. economy. Federal subsidies include, but are not limited to, substantial tax deductions for employer health insurance, hospital and nursing home construction, health workforce (mainly Medicare physicians) training, research (e. g., National Institutes of Health), and tax exemptions for nonprofits. The latest data for 2007 show that the largest tax subsidy for private health insurance-the federal exclusion from income and payroll taxes of employer and employee contributions for employer-sponsored health insurance-is estimated at $200 billion in lost revenues (Kaiser Family Foundation [KFF], 2008). The Joint Committee on Taxation (2008) reports an even higher amount: $143 billion lost in federal income tax and $100 billion for FICA taxes as tax expenditures for the employer coverage tax exclusion. In 2003, legislation continued and expanded government funding for proprietary healthcare (e. g., the pharmaceutical industry's Medicare Part D bill) that prohibits Medicare from negotiating drug prices and excludes Medicare from participating in or competing with private drug management companies, and forbids drug discounts to those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles), while giving bonus subsidies to private Medicare Advantage plans. The 2010 ACA both reduced and added different and new government subsidies for mostly private (and largely for-profit) Medicare services. Although the ACA cut or reduced some government subsidies (e. g., managed care and provider payments), industry lobbying has scaled back or delayed many such cost-saving provisions.

N2  - This article analyzes the movement of personnel among elite positions in business and government, contrasting the staffing patterns at higher rungs of the executive branch during the Clinton and G. W. Bush administrations. We find that the Bush administration recruited far more heavily from among corporate officers and directors than did the Clinton administration, particularly when staffing ambassadorships. We also find that both administrations served as springboards for subsequent corporate board appointments. There were relatively few patterns with respect to industry or geography, with the exception of the military: All but one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the turn of the millennium ended up serving on the board of a military contractor after completing their government service.

N2  - Activists rarely get everything they want from law and policy reforms. During the legislative process, proposed laws are negotiated, and what results are compromised versions of the laws activists originally lobbied for. Do these policy concessions create stumbling blocks or stepping stones for activists to pursue further change? The movement for animal protection in laboratory research provides a good case for examining this broad theoretical issue. I examine the influence of federal regulation at the laboratory level by interviewing scientists, bioethicists, veterinarians, and other professionals involved in research with animals. Some types of policy reform created structural access to laboratory decision-making for actors such as regulatory officials and bioethicists. This access facilitated dramatic changes in bureaucratic practices in the laboratory, and the potential for changes in the ethical considerations and attitudes of those involved in animal research. This access also provides institutional opportunities for activists to affect decision-making in the direction toward ending the practices they target.

Empirical evidence on the propensity to discriminate against foreign commercial interests by the BRICS, Turkey, the European Union, and the United States during the years 2008 to 2017 at, and behind, the border is employed to identify a group of six potential rule-shapers and two possible sham rule-takers.

N2  - A qualitative exploration allows interesting findings on the institutional culture of the French prefectoral corps, this status group of career civil servants in charge of representing the State in the provinces, whose members are in alternation also appointed to positions within core ministries, where they perform different missions but do not abandon their specific culture. Observing them at work in Paris is thus a fruitful ‘laboratory experience’ to identify the major features of the prefectoral culture—quite distinct from the classic bureaucratic culture. Our interviewees make three main self-legitimizing claims: (1) ‘We are officials with a ground-level experience’, as opposed to the ‘bureaucrats’ of the central services. (2) ‘We are representatives of the whole State and the General Interest’, meaning that they refuse to be assimilated to public servants among others, confined to the specific ministry where they temporarily work. (3) They reverse to their advantage the criticism against their politicization by claiming to be ‘the only civil servants who understand the logic of politics’. These identity assertions, which are attempts by the prefectoral corps to heighten its own stature with respect to rival groups and ministries, reveal its ambition to co-govern the State along with the political masters. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Evidence for corrupt practice in pharaonic Egypt is examined in comparative and culture specific contexts. Definitions of corruption are related to degrees of depersonalization of government, to levels of government penetration, and to the scale, efficiency, and professionalization of bureaucracy. Stress is laid on the personal nature of the Egyptian hierarchy, in a face-to-face society in which themes of loyalty, reciprocity, and client-patron relationships were important at all levels. The limitations of central control systems for the management of officials are discussed, and contrasted with the exercise of patronage-based authority in the mitigation of inappropriate behavior.

N2  - Background Promoting the sub-national ownership of national health initiatives is essential for efforts to achieve national health goals in federal systems where sub-national governments are semi-autonomous. Between 2008 and 2015, Nigerian government implemented a pilot free maternal and child health (MCH) programme in selected states to improve MCH by reducing physical and financial barriers of access to services. This study was conducted to better understand why the programme was neither adopted nor scaled-up by sub-national governments after pilot phase. Methods We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the programme in Imo and Niger States, with data from programme documents, in-depth interviews (45) and focus group discussions (16) at State and community levels. Data was analysed using manual thematic coding approach. Result Our analysis indicates that the programme design had two mutually dependent goals, which were also in tension with one another: 1. To ensure programme performance, the designers sought to shield its implementation from sub-national government politics and bureaucracy; and 2. To gain the buy-in of the same sub-national government politicians and bureaucrats, the designers sought to demonstrate programme performance. The potential for community advocacy for sub-national adoption and scale-up was not considered in the design. Therefore, limited involvement of sub-national governments in the programme design limited sub-national ownership during implementation. And limited oversight of implementation by sub-national government policymakers limited programme performance. Conclusion Efforts to promote sub-national ownership of national initiatives in decentralised health systems should prioritise inclusiveness in design, implementation, and oversight, and well-resourced community advocacy to sub-national governments for adoption and scale-up.

N2  - The paper provides an analysis of the impacts of the reform initiatives in the civil service have had to the country's administration. It shows how and to what extent the values of management-based reforms have been impacted on the government machinery and in particular, the senior civil servants in particular. The paper used the combination of descriptive and analytical methods of which data were obtained from both secondary sources and primary source of interviews. Despite the fact that Malaysia has kept itself abreast with the global trend through the introduction of the public management-oriented administration, evidences have shown that the implementation is far from being satisfactory. The paper argues that the implementation of managerial reforms have blurred the political-administrative interface which has subsequently led to politicization. As such, the paper attempts to enrich the limited knowledge by analyzing some opinions from the senior management figures i.e. Director Generals (DGs). Study on the impacts of the reforms towards the senior civil servants is relatively new in Malaysia and hence, the scarcity of respective literatures. The findings of the paper are very significant for all researchers in similar areas, even more so for policy makers and the civil servants.

N2  - This book reports the findings of two field studies conducted between 1993 and 2001 in seven townships and six provinces in China. The authors describe the process of rural urbanization and its related economic, social, and political changes by focusing mainly on the zhen (town), in addition to administrative offices and companies involved in the local economy, and village committees. The authors show that the social changes resulting from China's economic reforms are occurring mainly from below, and that this process is also resulting in a weakening of the economic and political dominance of the central government. Other changes discussed in this study include the development of new ownership structures and the increasing dominance of the private sector; a shift in the functions of administrative offices as the bureaucracy becomes increasingly business oriented; the rise of a new local elite; a rebirth of traditional social structures (clans, local associations); and the emergence of new interest groups and institutions to represent their needs.

N2  - In lobbying for the job discrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1964, liberal civil rights advocates wanted an administrative job discrimination enforcement regime modeled on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), with no private lawsuits. Pivotal conservative Republicans, empowered by a divided Democratic Party and the filibuster in the Senate, defeated an administrative framework and provided instead for private lawsuits with incentives for enforcement, including attorney's fees for winning plaintiffs. They were motivated by native suspicion toward bureaucratic regulation of business in general, as well as fear that they would not be able to control an NLRB-style civil rights agency in the hands of their ideological adversaries. In the political environment of 196364, some meaningful enforcement provisions were necessary, and to conservative Republicans private litigation was preferable to public bureaucracy. This choice had important self-reinforcing policy feedback effects. Civil rights advocates were initially optimistic about agency implementation and skeptical about the efficacy of private litigation to enforce Title VII, even with attorney's fees for winning plaintiffs. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, civil rights advocates observed an agency lacking the material resources and political will and commitment to carry out its mission. At the same time, they observed levels of private enforcement that far exceeded their expectations, as well as courts inclined toward broadly proplaintiff interpretations of Title VII. The CRA of 1964's attorney's fees provisions also had the effect of contributing funds to civil rights groups that prosecuted lawsuits and of conjuring into being a private, for-profit bar to litigate civil rights claims in general, and job discrimination claims in particular. These developments drove a transformation in the enforcement preferences of civil rights groups toward private litigation, weakening their historic support for administrative implementation. Working together with the burgeoning for-profit civil rights bar, they mobilized to expand the fee-shifting provisions of the CRA of 1964 across the entire field of civil rights, which they accomplished by successfully lobbying for enactment of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976. Thus was created the modern civil rights enforcement framework. © 2009 Copyright Cambridge University Press.

N2  - How do small, grassroots NGOs influence a powerful authoritarian state and its policies? This paper presents data on instances of interaction between China’s grassroots NGOs and party-state agencies through which NGOs are able to exert influence on policymaking and implementation by modeling innovations in action. The analysis begins by painting the backdrop against which policy influence occurs: a political context characterized by diminished bureaucratic capacity, policy discretion, and experimentation under hierarchy. It then presents the argument that collaboration between grassroots NGOs and local government agencies can act as a risk mitigation strategy for official innovation in a system of experimentation under hierarchy. Extensive longitudinal field research across six sub-national units shows convergence among grassroots NGOs on a conception of advocacy in action. This expanded conception of advocacy overcomes the dichotomy between advocacy and service delivery functions, and allows for observation of a fuller range of efforts that include ‘obstructive’ as well as ‘instructive’ advocacy. Globally, traditional channels of political participation are decreasing in availability and efficacy. This research shows how, as growing numbers of the populace organize to address social and environmental challenges through grassroots organizations, they open alternate channels of political participation, in turn refashioning state practice. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - How do citizen groups influence policy, particularly in political contexts thought to lack grassroots inputs into the policymaking process? Predominant explanations focus on bargaining and mobilization around interests and identities, neglecting the role of ideas. Emerging scholarship shows how knowledge-or epistemic power-shapes political decision making. This paper applies these advances to the Chinese context to uncover how knowledge communities impact policy and governance. The paper draws on extensive longitudinal field research embracing Chinese NGOs, local officials, and policy research bodies. It presents three cases of cross-sector collective knowledge generation within the Chinese context. In these cases, communities comprised of combinations of NGO staff, villagers, academics and officials interact around specific policy issues, generating knowledge and spurring policy innovations. The cases highlight the porous nature of sectoral boundaries that enable the formation of cross-sector communities, suggest an expanded notion of epistemic expertise and a broader conceptualization of knowledge production. In this way, the paper identifies mechanisms by which knowledge about development intersects with power structures and is then diffused.

N2  - This study examines operational sustainability of a major telecentre initiative - the Union Digital Centre (UDC) in Bangladesh - from the perspective of public-private-people's partnership (PPPP). Given the rising incidence of dropout of private entrepreneurs causing premature closure of telecentres, it is important to understand and identify key variables that affect sustainability of the scheme. In appreciation of the difficulty associated with operationalisation of the term 'sustainability’ in this study we adopt ‘operational sustainability’ as an alternative to investigate the dynamics of sustenance. We have reviewed key literature about various dimensions of sustainability and their interrelationships in order to develop hypotheses about sustainability of the UDC and factors associated with it. Drawing on data collected from a survey of 538 private entrepreneurs and 41 interviews with government officials we show the extent to which various elements of the UDC eco-system contribute to its sustainability. The application of a structural equation model confirms that both financial and social outcomes of the UDC depend largely on inputs and contributions of various stakeholders. The paper concludes that effective engagement of private entrepreneurs is critical, as is governmental patronage, for ensuring operational sustainability of partnership-based telecentres like the UDC. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - The nineties were a period of mass reforms in South African policing. Within a few years of its transition from apartheid to democracy, the South African Police Service (SAPS) had developed a performance measurement tool based on the New York CompStat system. Such tools have been praised for their apparent effectiveness in reducing crime but scorned for the pressures they place on police officers. This article demonstrates that the SAPS' Performance Chart has framed the police as crime fighters, giving little to no regard for community relations or police legitimacy. While organisational rhetoric emphasises police-community relations and police professionalism, these are absent from the targets by which police are assessed. The unintended consequences were clearly demonstrated when angry residents of Khayelitsha in Cape Town successfully lobbied for a Commission of Inquiry into the failures of policing in 2012. The scandal showed that despite good intentions, the introduction of the Chart has not produced effective, democratic policing. On the contrary, the resulting pressure to `perform' can and has promoted police practices that erode community trust in and cooperation with police. For the SAPS, this is particularly true in the absence of a measure of public confidence or of feelings of safety..

N2  - To what extent do local administrators include business interests in their informal bargaining and negotiation on issues involving economic development and environmental and sustainability policies? In the absence of previous studies, we extend political market theory to decisions involving administrative officials by investigating differences across city agencies in the extent they provide business organizations access to the policy development processes. A multilevel analysis is applied to a unique set of survey responses from 413 local government administrators in 50 of the 54 largest U.S. cities. These design and data innovations provide new insights into local administrators' willingness to grant access to economic development interests. Within individual cities, we account for differences in agency mission and administrators' personal positions and experiences. Across cities, we account comparatively for variations in government size, demographic characteristics, ideology, and growth patterns.

By foregrounding race and racism, illuminating power structures and discourses, and centering the knowledge and practices of nonprofit staff as street-level workers, critical race methods reveal the processes of construction that shape and influence a seemingly objective count and highlight the roles that staff play as mediators in the conflicts between fear and trust that are inherent to racial governance in the United States. © 2022 Public Administration Theory Network.

N2  - Recent empirical literature has shown that the determination of intergovernmental grants is highly influenced by the political bargaining power of the recipient states. In these models federal politicians are assumed to buy the support of state voters, state politicians and state interest groups by providing grants. In this paper we provide evidence that the fiscal referendum reduces the reliance of states on matching grants received from the central government and thus the possibility of interest groups and state bureaucrats to obtain more grants. If referendums are available, voters serve as a hard budget constraint.

N2  - In this concise, timely book, constitutional law expert Stephen M. Feldman draws on neoconservative writings to explore the rise of the neocons and their influence on the Supreme Court. Neocons burst onto the political scene in the early 1980s via their assault on pluralist democracy's ethical relativism, where no pre-existing or higher principles limit the agendas of interest groups. Instead, they advocated for a resurrection of republican democracy, which declares that virtuous citizens and officials pursue the common good. Yet despite their original goals, neocons quickly became an interest group themselves, competing successfully within the pluralist democratic arena. When the political winds shifted in 2008, however, neocons found themselves shorn of power in Congress and the executive branch. But portentously, they still controlled the Supreme Court. Neoconservative Politics and the Supreme Court explains how and why the neoconservatives criticized but operated within pluralist democracy, and, most important, what the entrenchment of neocons on the Supreme Court means for present and future politics and law.

N2  - Because of the selection and appointment of managers in state-owned enterprises in China is mainly determined by the government (officials) in accordance with their reputation, this provides an opportunity to select rent-seeking behavior for them to enhance their reputation. So research how to effectively control their rent-seeking behavior has become a very important issue. This paper established a dynamic analysis model based on the theory of Markov of state-owned enterprise managers rent-seeking behavior. Studies shows that, The optimal rent-seeking efforts of China's state-owned enterprise rent-seeking behavior is increasing with the increase of rent-seeking success coefficient, the income coefficient, and the penalty coefficient and it is decreasing with the increase of the coefficient of the efforts of operators. Then put forward some feasible suggestions for weakening the rent-seeking behavior of state-owned operators.

N2  - This paper explores the development and implementation of strategies for sustainable mobility in Basel, Switzerland. Basel (Bale, Basilea, Basle) has been identified as a `relatively successful' practitioner of sustainable mobility, with an urban form that is not only conducive to walking and cycling, but also has an extensive public transport system and high levels of commuting using these sustainable modes of transport. With a low share of journeys by motor vehicles compared to many other European cities - combined with a legally-binding objective to reduce vehicle traffic by a further 10\% from 2010 to 2020 Basel appears to be a forerunner with regard to sustainable mobility policy and practice. Five years after this objective was passed into law - following a public vote, as Basel is part of the Swiss confederation and practices direct democracy - this study aims to assess the extent of policy implementation and reflect on challenges and opportunities for the future. The paper presents findings from a series of interviews with stakeholders in Basel on the theme of sustainable mobility. Key questions include: is it possible to develop coherent strategies and policies to further reduce the role of motor vehicles and in doing so, achieve a modal shift? How does participation in a direct democracy influence strategy and policy development and outcomes? Do compromises and trade-offs mean strategies and policies promoting sustainable mobility are, like Swiss cheese, riddled with holes? By illustrating challenges and opportunities when advancing sustainable mobility in a participative culture, the study provides insights for policymakers and researchers in other contexts. Among the conclusions is an emphasis on the importance of committed individuals capable of expanding the `strategy space' of processes. Participation provides one such opportunity, yet may also generate divergent or contradictory trends causing incrementalism. A rapid transition to sustainable mobility is thus likely to require increased politicisation of the topic by both politicians and civil servants.

N2  - This study investigates the framing of immigration by political actors in US election news from 2006 to 2014 and how they present the issue as a problem (for society, for immigrants, no problem frames). Through a content analysis of national newspapers coverage of midterm and presidential elections, we explore the relationship between the people sourced in the stories and the framing of immigration as a problem. Results show that despite an increasingly competitive framing field (with more non-governmental, non-elite sources salient in news coverage), government officials and candidates are still often mentioned in stories on immigration. Seen along party lines, framing of immigration as a problem for society is more associated with Republican government officials and candidates for office than with Democrats. Special interest groups and Law enforcement sources are also attached to immigration framing. Implications for the understanding of how the immigration issue is framed during electoral periods are discussed.

N2  - This article addresses the issue of how political and administrative actors relate to each other, focusing on the selection of Senior Civil Servants as key actors to implement public policies. A literature review and documental analysis were carried out, and an on-line questionnaire was applied to Senior Civil Servants in managerial positions in Portugal between 2004 and 2011 (n = 964). The results show that, in all cases, the p-value was equal or less than .05 (p <= .05). The analysis allowed us to confirm two main criteria used for the selection of Senior Civil Servants (political and professional) and their respective factors. Despite indicating that the political criterion somehow plays a role in the selection of public officials in Portugal, the study could not confirm the hypothesis that political factors are predominant when hiring senior civil servants in the country.

N2  - At 38,000, the total number of staff at the European Commission is relatively small for a body representing half a billion citizens. Likewise, the 3,500 strong research and statistical team is modest in size given that it operates across the Directorates General and other services. In order to assist policy-makers, the Commission supplements this research base by using outside expertise to advise at all stages of the policy-making process. For many years, those who observe the European Union's institutions have recognised that this use of outside expertise to assist with the shaping of policy presents a potential democratic shortfall. The 2001 White Paper on Governance acknowledged that the line between expertise and political authority had become blurred and that, increasingly, the public questioned the independence of expert advice. The following year, the Commission published its first set of guidelines on the collection and use of expertise, listing 'openness' as one of three core principles. Despite considerable changes that have occurred in the transparency landscape in the intervening period, the Commission's commitment to this core principle of expertise remains. This article investigates the measures the Commission introduced specifically to facilitate this openness. Applying a structure-agency approach, the article characterises an expert group as a 'community of knowledge' and contrasts the transparency of the Commission's formal appointment procedures with the less visible but frequently used informal measures through which individuals are identified and approached. Based on a recent and highly relevant case, the article employs data gathered from the near contemporaneous accounts of expert group members and Commission officials. It finds that the reported appointment processes do not reflect the widespread incidence of individuals selected based on previous contact or personal recommendation and argues that this may undermine the integrity of the Commission's core principle of openness in the use of expertise and in its broader transparency measures. In terms of the motivation of those responding to the Commission's call for experts, the article finds that membership of an expert group confers a degree of professional prestige that directly benefits individual members and offers competitive advantage to their parent organisations.

N2  - The two special features were on the challenge of asylum seeker poverty for local social service providers, and the issue of discrimination against 'immigrant' minority roma (gypsy) populations in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as they apply for membership of the EU. The letter was sent by high-level representatives of many pressure groups (doctors, social workers, churches, labour unions) and argued for a more liberal treatment of asylum seekers in Britain. The four news items were (i) a critical report by Paul Gilroy on the link between immigration and crime in which he writes 'making the connection between alien settlement and excessive law-breaking is now a means to rationalise the on-going marginalization of the locally-born grandchildren of citizen-settlers'; (ii) a report on the granting of asylum to a woman domestic worker who was effectively a slave of her Sudanese diplomatic employer; (iii) a report of the immigration minister's statement on a hardening of policy towards asylum seekers. She argued that 'it is not acceptable for people to claim asylum after working illegally simply as a way of staying on at the taxpayer's expense and delaying removal'; (iv) a report on the contest for leadership of the Commission for Racial Equality. Will it be an Asian woman who is a health bureaucrat or an Afro-Caribbean man who is a Labour politician and whose case is supported by the Blair government? These texts from a 'liberal' newspaper tell us a lot about the (very biased) nature of debates on immigration issues in the UK. © 2003, The Human Geographical Society of Japan. All rights reserved.

N2  - Media pressure on government and public administration has intensified radically in recent years. This article analyzes the behind-the-scenes processes of a strategic government pitch that aims to push the success and core values of Norwegian immigration policies in the media. The study brings attention to the complex and often conflicting demands on government officials engaged in proactive media strategies. It examines how the officials adapt to the news media logic, perceive the competition with other strategic actors, and simultaneously pay regard to the constraints inherent in a bureaucratic ethos. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork, the article illuminates how bureaucrats legitimize proactive strategies; the risks involved; and how these strategies modify the distinctive roles of political leaders and civil servants, challenging traditional bureaucratic values such as impartiality, neutrality, and loyalty.

N2  - Objective: Identify the barriers and facilitators of health advocacy to users delivered by nurses from the Family Health Strategy. Method: Qualitative study carried out with nurses from the Family Health Strategy of a city in the south of Brazil. Study participants were 15 nurses, who were interviewed. The content of the interviews was recorded, transcribed and analyzed in the light of the discursive text analysis. Results: Two categories emerged, one about the lack of organization at the workplace, bureaucracy and limitations to professional work in health environments, and another about the facilitating aspects to exercise advocacy both individually and collectively. Conclusion: When nurses, provided with technical, scientific and relational knowledge, are empowered to make decisions, they are not only supported by other professionals at work but also develop actions of health advocacy to users, thus qualifying the care delivered.

N2  - Using a cross-sectional survey of 254 Turkish district governors, this study assesses the impact of personality on decision-making among public managers. The research evaluates self-reported results from the Five-Factor Model of personality and the Decision-Making Questionnaire of the psychology literature. The findings suggest that Openness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion are important in the analysis of decision-making subjects, tasks, and contexts, respectively. Departing from previous research, the analysis here suggests that culture and structure are important factors in explaining personality and decision-making in public administration. Points for practitioners: This study offers policy implications for the recruitment, performance appraisal, training, and assignment of practitioners in the public service. Personality assessments can be used as a valuable tool during the evaluation of public officials under consideration for recruitment, appointment, and promotion. Matching the personalities of potential candidates to positions requiring comparable qualifications has important organizational, personnel, and financial implications. Our research also suggests that decision-making and personality should also account for social, cultural, and organizational differences in their applications.

N2  - Scholars have found differences between older and newer foundations and their giving priorities and strategies, especially in education. Foundations founded in recent decades with still-living benefactors have been more vocal, result-oriented, and focused on education initiatives like charter schools and alternative certification than their older counterparts. In this paper, I examine whether these differing patterns hold for new and old foundation grants to state departments of education, leading new foundations to target contexts politically amenable to education reform while old foundations focus less on politics and more on state need. Using data on the largest 1000 foundations, in addition to grants from the Gates and Wallace Foundations, I find that new, but not old, foundations, are more likely to support education reform policies when giving to state education agencies. I also find that new, but not old, foundations support state education agencies possessing political contexts conducive to education reform as well as higher levels of child poverty. I illustrate these findings with the case of Kentucky. These findings suggest that, by taking advantage of state need while seeking out political allies, new foundations behave like interest groups in their grants to government.

N2  - Continuity and advocacy are widely held to be important elements in maternal healthcare, yet they are often lacking from the care women receive. In order to understand this disparity, we draw upon interviews and ethnographic observational findings from The One-to-One Caseload Project, a study exploring the impacts of a caseload model of maternity care within an urban National Health Service provider in Britain. Drawing on Lipsky's (1980) and Prottas's (1979) theories of street-level bureaucracy, this paper attempts to understand how midwives, working on the frontline within caseload and standard care models, manage the competing demands of delivering a personalised service within a bureaucratic organisation. The caseload care model serves as a case study for how a client-centred model of working can assist street-level bureaucrats to manage the administrative pressures of public service organisations and provide their clients with a personalised, responsive service. Nevertheless, despite such benefits, client-centred models of working may have unintended consequences for both health carers and healthcare systems. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Transparency and lobbying, two terms that have direct influences on the behavior of policymakers, politicians, and bureaucrats. Models of both transparency and lobbying exist for decades and are being researched by not only academics but non-profit international organizations and institutions that provide governments with policy recommendations. The recommendations are, however, often based on research that is complicated or almost impossible to perform or relies on self-report surveys by the public officials and policy makers. The real behavior of those actors might, therefore, be hidden. Therefore, there opens an opportunity to model these situations and bring transparency and lobbying into the laboratory or field controlled environment and investigate the behavior of involved actors using methods of experimental economics. As the experimental economics is a field of economic research that has been emerging in the main flow for las few decades, the research on transparency and lobbying is, therefore, emerging as well. There have been published studies that focused on transparency and studies that investigated lobbying, however, the number of publications on experimental research on transparent lobbying is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of experimental research on lobbying and transparency, evaluate the findings and provide suggestions for future research.

N2  - The nature of land-use regulation differs by type of jurisdiction. Regulatory politics at the local level is the major source of the dynamic consistency problem. Courts are reluctant to enforce the regulatory commitments of previous officials at all levels of government, but the alternative political and reputation constraints on official promise-keeping are most problematic at the local level. Local majoritarianism presents the greatest challenge to attempts to improve the dynamic efficiency of land-use regulation.

N2  - Local election officials (LEOs) are critical to the administration of federal elections and the implementation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA, P.L. 107-252). Three surveys of LEOs were performed by academic institutions in collaboration with the Congressional Research Service. Although care needs to be taken in interpreting the results, they may have implications for several policy issues, such as how election officials are chosen and trained, the best ways to ensure that voting systems and election procedures are sufficiently effective, secure, and voter-friendly, and whether adjustments should be made to HAVA requirements. Major results include the following: The demographic characteristics of LEOs differ from those of other government officials. Almost three-quarters are women, and 5% are minorities. Most do not have a college degree, and most were elected, although those characteristics appear to be changing. Some results suggest areas of potential improvement such as in training and participation in professional associations. LEOs believed that the federal government has too great an influence on the acquisition of voting systems, and that local elected officials have too little. Their concerns increased from 2004 to 2006 about the influence of the media, political parties, advocacy groups, and vendors. Concern about the influence of these groups increased again, slightly, from 2006 to 2008. LEOs were highly satisfied with whatever voting system they used but were less supportive of other kinds. Their satisfaction declined from 2004 to 2006 for all systems except lever machines, but rebounded in 2008. They also rated their primary voting systems as very accurate, secure, reliable, and voter- and pollworker-friendly, no matter what system they used. However, the most common incident reported by respondents in both the 2006 and 2008 elections was malfunction of a direct recording (DRE) or optical scan (OS) electronic voting system. The incidence of long lines at polling places was highest in jurisdictions using DREs. Most DRE users did not believe that voter-verified paper audit trails (VVPAT) should be required, but nonusers believed they should be. However, the percentage of DRE users who supported VVPAT increased from 2004 to 2008, and more VVPAT users were satisfied with them in 2008 than in 2006. On average, LEOs mildly supported requiring photo identification for all voters and believed it would make elections more secure, even though they strongly believed that it will negatively affect turnout and did not believe that voter fraud is a problem in their jurisdictions. In all three surveys, LEOs believed that HAVA is making moderate improvements in the electoral process. The level of support declined from 2004 to 2006 but increased to its highest point in 2008. LEOs reported that HAVA has increased the accessibility of voting but has made elections more complicated and has increased their cost, though fewer believed so in 2008 than in 2006. LEOs spent much more time preparing for the election in 2008 than in 2004. They also believed that the increased complexity of elections is hindering recruitment of pollworkers. Most found the activities of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) that HAVA created moderately important, and that its helpfulness improved from 2006 to 2008. Their assessment of the statewide voter-registration database was neutral in 2006 but positive in 2008. They believed that it was more accurate and fair than their previous registration system. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - We estimate the market valuation of personal ties to Richard Cheney. Our proxies for personal ties are based on corporate board linkages that are prevalent in the network sociology literature. We consider a number of distinct political and personal events that either affected Cheney's political fortunes or his ability to hand out political favors. Specifically, we consider: (a) market reaction of connected companies to news of Cheney's heart attacks; (b) market reaction of connected companies to Cheney's being placed in charge of the vice-presidential search process and his surprise self-appointment; (c) correlation of the value of connected companies with the probability of a Bush victory in 2000; and (d) correlation of the value of connected companies with the probability of war in Iraq. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that in all cases, the value of ties to Cheney is precisely estimated as zero. We interpret this as evidence that U.S. institutions are effective in controlling rent-seeking through personal ties with high-level government officials.

N2  - When China became a republic in 1912, the country's core territorial units of province and county were retained intact. Continuity in the territorial architecture of state from empire to republic invites the question of whether provinces and counties were institutionally identical before and after the revolution. This paper explores adjustments made to the county level of government aimed at meeting republican ideals of good government and popular sovereignty. It probes changes in the roles assigned to county heads and the patterns of their appointment in Guangdong relating to educational qualifications, native places, and tenure over the transitional period. Employing magistrate tenure as a proxy for the stability of local government, the paper correlates variations in the length of tenure with other variables at the provincial and sub-provincial levels of government, including competition between different echelon levels, disputes between military and civil authorities, in-fighting among regime factions, and methods of appointment varying over time from appointment by administrative fiat to county-head elections. By relating these variables to longitudinal data on magistrates' length of tenure, it identifies some of the challenges facing provincial and county authorities in trying to manage the revolutionary transition from empire to republic at the local level while keeping the inherited territorial system largely intact.

N2  - Over the past two decades many developing countries have implemented comprehensive reforms of their tax administrations in order to increase revenue and curb corruption. This paper examines recent experiences in the fight against corruption in the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). It argues that the technocratic remedies supported by donors have underplayed the degree to which progress in tax administration depends upon a thorough 'cultural change' in the public service. The motives of individual actors are often inextricably tied to the interests of the social groups to which they belong. In the URA patronage runs through networks grounded on ties of kinship and community origin. As such, people recognize the benefits of large extended families and strong kinship ties, even as their social and economic aspirations may be indisputably modern. This implies that such social relations may undermine formal bureaucratic structures and positions. If these problems, which are rooted in social norms and patterns of behavior rather than administrative features, are overlooked, the result may be to distort incentives. As a consequence, the government's commitment to reforming the tax administration may also be undermined.

N2  - Laws that regulate the conduct of professional lobbyists in statehouses across the nation are one attempt to ensure that citizens’ opinions receive more equal consideration when elected officials make policy decisions. Do states with stricter lobbying regulations actually display more egalitarian patterns of political representation? Using public opinion measures from the National Annenberg Election Surveys and data on state policies, this article first demonstrates that state policy decisions are consistently more proximate to the opinions of affluent citizens. I then evaluate the relationship between the stringency of state lobbying regulations and representational equality across the states and find evidence that states with stricter regulations weigh citizens’ opinions more equally in the policymaking process. These findings suggest that lobbying regulations can play an important role in promoting greater political equality.

N2  - Title X, a federal program funding family planning services in the United States, had broad popular and political support throughout the 1970s. But in the early 1980s, it was subjected to a relentless campaign by anti-abortionists, most notably the Catholic absolutist Judie Brown. Brown blended social with economically conservative rhetoric, attempting to persuade Republican President Ronald Reagan and the broader right-to-life movement that attacking Title X was a legitimate means of targeting its largest recipient, Planned Parenthood. In highlighting Brown's activism and lobbying, and the actions of pro-lifers within the bureaucracy, this article illuminates the strategies of socially conservative women and their place within the contemporary Right. It also historicizes conservative interest in family planning and demonstrates the tension within the Reagan Revolution as single-issue activists struggled to compel the administration to match words with actions.

N2  - This article examines the right to public participation in resources and environmental decision-making in Alberta. The only reasonable conclusion from the analysis in the paper is that there is currently no legal right to public participation in resources and environmental project decision-making in Alberta. Project decision-makers have no obligation to hear organized public interest groups or members of the public at large who are unable to demonstrate how a project may personally affect them. The public interest character of resource development decisions has thus far had no identifiable impact on the consideration of participatory rights by Alberta courts. Resources and environmental project decision-making is thus not necessarily subject to public scrutiny and it becomes more difficult to hold officials exercising public power over resource development legally accountable for their actions. The role of public participation as an accepted means to influence the exercise of state power over matters concerning the public interest deserves more critical and focused attention from Alberta courts.

N2  - Foreign policy scholars have long emphasized bipartisanship in foreign policymaking, particularly in the context of presidential appointments to the foreign policy bureaucracy, emphasizing the role of international crises and national security in affecting bipartisanship. In spite of their enduring nature, few systematic analyses of these claims exist. This study addresses these gaps using new data on appointees to the foreign policy bureaucracy. The results challenge the conventional wisdoms emerging from the foreign policy literature regarding the importance of factors like war, instead pointing to the importance of domestic political factors in affecting bipartisanship in appointments to the foreign policy bureaucracy.

N2  - Competition to advance issues on public policy agendas is constant. Political scientists agree that professional "policy entrepreneurs" (researchers, academics, and bureaucrats) serve as conduits in this process. Grassroots advocacy has always been part of the political landscape as non-professional people also take on the role of policy advocates or activists, to get specific problems and preferred solutions onto public and policy agendas and motivate policyrnakers to take action. The contribution of grassroots advocacy to significant policy changes is often under-funded because its impacts are hard to isolate and quantify, and are often most evident in retrospect. This paper examines the contribution of the Global Campaign for Microbicides to the movement to expand the range of HIV prevention options for women and describes how it mobilized hundreds of grassroots policy activists around the world to take coordinated action on this issue. It reviews the Campaign's accomplishments and highlights some of its strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the paper considers the value of similar efforts on the part of grassroots advocates seeking to influence the post-ICPD and post-2015 development agendas as they are being negotiated. Decisions regarding what kind of advocacy work is carried out during this process, and by whom and how, will inevitably shape the content of these new frameworks.

N2  - This book documents the United States Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) shift from a rancher-dominated agency to an energy-dominated agency. This shift is analyzed by identifying the conditions under which the expansion of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the Rocky Mountain West triggered a political conflict between ranching and energy stakeholder groups. Through scrutiny of federal actions and policies implemented by the Executive Branch between 2004 and 2010, the book sheds light on the emphasis of domestic energy production during this time period, and how the traditional ranching and energy alliance was split by shifting policy interests. The book is meant for policy makers, natural resource agencies, and students and researchers engaged in political science, public administration, and natural resource management. Chapter 1 introduces readers to the case study at hand, and reviews literature on public land agencies and policies. Chapter 2 summarizes the legal history of public land management by the federal government, and the conditions that caused the BLM to favor energy development over ranching in the mid-2000's. Chapter 3 details the role of the Executive Branch (Bush-Cheney administration) in affecting the BLM's domestic energy policies and resource allocation, and chapter 4 analyzes the role of subgovernments in affecting the BLM's motivations too. Chapters 5, 6 and 7 contain first-hand accounts from government officials, state petroleum associations, and ranching supported interest groups to explore the concept of subgovernment stakeholder domination in policymaking, and analyze the similarities and differences between different policy-making elites. Chapter 8 concludes the text by summarizing subgovernment theory, mapping the behaviors of subgovernment actors, and discussing the implications for future political appointees in the direction of land-management agencies like the BLM. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

N2  - A permanent political class has emerged on a scale unprecedented in our nation ‘s history. Its self-dealing, nepotism, and corruption contribute to rising inequality. Its reach extends from the governing elite throughout nongovernmental institutions. Aside from constituting an oligarchy of prestige and power, it enables the creation of an aristocracy of massive inherited wealth that is accumulating immense political power. In a muckraking tour de force reminiscent of Lincoln Steffens, Upton Sinclair, and C. Wright Mills, American Oligarchy demonstrates the way the corrupt culture of the permanent political class extends down to the state and local level. Ron Formisano breaks down the ways this class creates economic inequality and how its own endemic corruption infects our entire society. Formisano delves into the work of not just politicians but lobbyists, consultants, appointed bureaucrats, pollsters, celebrity journalists, behind-the-scenes billionaires, and others. Their shameless pursuit of wealth and self-aggrandizement, often at taxpayer expense, rewards channeling the flow of income and wealth to elites. That inequality in turn has choked off social mobility and made a joke of meritocracy. As Formisano shows, these forces respond to the oligarchy ‘s power and compete to bask in the presence of the.01 percent. They also exacerbate the dangerous instability of an American democracy divided between extreme wealth and extreme poverty. © 2017 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

N2  - The Council is too often depicted as the battleground for intermittent clashes between national ministers. Based upon case studies of legislation produced in five `First Pillar' sectors, the research presented here has explored the submerged, and much larger, part of this institutional `iceberg': Council working groups. It does so by examining how members of these entities interact with civil servants in COREPER and ministers, on the one hand, and representatives of the Commission and the European Parliament, on the other. Contrary to many practitioner or formalist accounts, the principal finding is that working groups do not operate solely on a `technical level'. Instead, they are vital arenas through which the ambiguous nature of politics in the European Union heavily influences negotiating processes and legislative outcomes.

N2  - Does the partisanship of officeholders affect environmental outcomes? The popular perception is that Republicans are bad for the environment, but complicating factors like federalism may limit this outcome. Using a dataset that tracks toxic releases over 20 years, we examine how partisan control of executive and legislative branches at both state and federal levels affect environmental policy. Moving beyond the passage of policies or environmental program spending allows us to fully understand the impact of Republicans on the environment. In addition, we take into account structural complications that may shape the relationship between Republican control and environmental outcomes. We find that the conventional wisdom that Republicans are bad for the environment has some validity, but it is dependent on what offices Republican elected officials occupy. More specifically, Republicans significantly affect toxic chemical releases when occupying governorships and controlling Congress. Our conclusions provide further insight into understanding how partisanship affects environmental outcomes, including how partisanship composition across the federal system matters.

N2  - Background/Context: Researchers have found that school districts with greater representation of Latinos and African Americans on their school boards tend to also have higher percentages of Latino and African American administrators and teachers. This increased presence of coethnics in the educational bureaucracy was then found to predict more favorable educational outcomes for these students. Purpose: We determine if these relationships hold for Latinos in California, which has the largest Latino population in the United States and where Latino students make up just under half of all students enrolled in public schools. Research Design: Using an original data set of all California school districts in the 2004-2005 school year, we tested these relationships for Latinos in California using multiple regression. Conclusion: Contrary to previous research, we found that Latino representation on California school boards was not greater in systems of single-member district election. We did, however, find that the greater presence of Latinos on school boards did increase the likelihood that Latinos would be hired as administrators, but only in Latino-majority districts. After appropriate controls, districts with more Latino administrators also tended to have more Latino teachers. Last, and again contrary to previous research, we found no systematic impact of having more Latino teachers and administrators on enhancing student outcomes for either all Latino students or for English language learners.

N2  - In this article we examine the patterns of gendered representation and related legislative advocacy within Latino delegations to four state legislatures in the Southwest. Most agree that one of the most significant changes in American politics in the post-civil rights era is the increasing election of women and people of color, but there is less agreement about the magnitude, consistency, and impact of this representation. Moreover, little is known about how these patterns vary by state. First, we examine the patterns of gendered and ethnic election in the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas from 1990-2004. We find considerable variation across these states, relative to both women and Latinos, but the presence of Latinas within the Latino/a delegation has noticeably increased across all the states and at a rate that outpaces the increase in women in the legislatures overall. Second, using original survey data supplemented with elite interviews, we explore perceived differences in the representational. priorities and related behaviors, issue agendas, and policy successes between Latinas and Latino men. We find a number of similarities but also find distinct differences that reveal Latinas place greater emphasis on representing the interests of multiple minority groups, promoting conflict resolution, and building consensus in both the legislature as a whole and within the Latino caucus. Latinas also are more likely than Latino men to introduce and successfully pass legislation that addresses the issue agenda held by both Latina and Latino legislators.

N2  - This article asks how CSOs engage with policymakers in advancing policy change on women’s rights in the Philippine context where political dynasties are prevalent. It draws primarily upon interviews with leaders of women’s organizations, former leaders, directors, and current staff of the policy agency involved in the advocacy work for the Magna Carta of Women, which is regarded as the Philippine version of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Findings reveal that while CSOs used formal spaces such as official meetings and dialogues, CSOs also used informal modes of engagement: personal relationships, intermediaries, and reciprocity. Informal modes provide CSOs with the opportunity for sustained and long-term engagement as they develop personal bonds with policymakers which may extend beyond the term of office or appointment period.

N2  - On May 4, 2000, Detroit's reform school board selected Kenneth Burnely, the then superintendent of the Colorado Springs Public Schools, as its choice for the city schools' first permanent chief executive officer (CEO) (Miller 2000; Nichols and Harmon 2000; Walsh-Sarnecki and Schmitt 2000). His appointment marked the culmination of a year and a half struggle, modeled in large part after the 1995 mayoral takeover of the Chicago public schools, to replace the city's elected school board with one appointed by the mayor and to replace a traditional superintendent with the new position of CEO. It was a battle that pitted segments of the city's majority African-American population against each other, that brought Detroit's largely African-American Democratic legislative delegation into conflict with both the city's African-American Democratic Mayor, Dennis Archer, and the virtually all white Republican dominated state legislature, and created a working alliance around school reform between Mayor Archer and Michigan's Republican governor, John Engler. This battle over the governance of the Detroit public schools, then, provides a good case study of an effort to transfer a reform initiative, in this case a mayoral takeover, from one setting to another and the resulting pattern of conflicts and alliances over school reform that at least one city school system is currently experiencing. In this essay, I will examine the debates surrounding the takeover legislation from the end of 1998 through its passage in March 1999, explore the resulting pattern of discord and agreement, look at how issues of race played themselves out in these engagements, and consider what these battles tell us about the prospects of a mayoral takeover as a reform strategy.

N2  - When disaster strikes, urban planners often rely on feedback and guidance from committees of officials, residents, and interest groups when crafting reconstruction policy. Focusing on recovery planning committees after Japan's 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disasters, we compile and analyze a dataset on committee membership patterns across 39 committees with 657 members. Using descriptive statistics and social network analysis, we examine 1) how community representation through membership varied among committees, and 2) in what ways did committees share members, interlinking members from certain interests groups. This study finds that community representation varies considerably among committees, negatively related to the prevalence of experts, bureaucrats, and business interests. Committee membership overlap occurred heavily along geographic boundaries, bridged by engineers and government officials. Engineers and government bureaucrats also tend to be connected to more members of the committee network than community representatives, giving them prized positions to disseminate ideas about best practices in recovery. This study underscores the importance of diversity and community representation in disaster recovery planning to facilitate equal participation, information access, and policy implementation across communities.

N2  - Ascertaining which interest groups are considered relevant by policymakers presents an important challenge for political scientists. Existing approaches often focus on the submission of written evidence or the inclusion in expert committees. While these approaches capture the effort of groups, they do not directly indicate whether policy makers consider these groups as highly relevant political actors. In this paper we introduce a novel theoretical approach to address this important question, namely prominence. We argue that, in the legislative arena, prominence can be operationalised as groups being mentioned strategically–used as a resource–by elected officials as they debate policy matters. Furthermore, we apply a machine learning solution to reliably assess which groups are prominent among legislators. We illustrate this novel method relying on a dataset of mentions of over 1300 national interest groups in parliamentary debates in Australia over a six-year period (2010–2016).

N2  - This study is designed to present a comprehensive view of government in cities and towns with populations between 2,500 and 25,000 in order to determine that the council-manager form of government has made a consequential difference in government at the local level. Two major forms of government in 559 municipalities are compared and contrasted regarding nine selected variables. Data are evaluated using the independent samples t-test and regression analysis. Results from this research study demonstrate several differences in local government administration and its provision of municipal services. The data in this analysis show that a statistically significant level of differentiation between the council-manager and non-council-manager forms of government can be seen regarding the education level of the chief administrative officer; the percentages of time this individual devotes to the policy, administrative, and political roles; and the per capita expenditure levels of the municipalities in cities and towns with populations between 2,500 and 25,000. However, the study does not indicate that form of government significantly affects the provision of municipal services and the influence of political activities and special interest groups on municipal decisions of cities and towns in this same population range.

N2  - This article concerns the politics of environmental policy as it has been evolving in the South African city of Durban. How has the end of apartheid impacted on environmental issues and concerns? Since 1994 (actually 1996 from the standpoint of local government), the transition to democracy has brought about a shift from purely green policy to the growing salience of what we may call brown issues. The article first considers the elements of what we would now denote as environmental policy under the old regime and then outlines the policy shifts in recent years. The second half of the article looks at what have emerged as the most significant policy issues with regard to the environment, the future of the South Coast Industrial Basin, the environmental concerns that arise from the construction of new housing settlements and (more briefly) debates about the future of the Bay of Natal and some of the issues at play in the development of an integrated social health policy. With South Africa's emergence from isolation, international mandates for environmental controls and planning have been formally adopted; this article argues that the actual application of policy from word to deed is another matter. Democratization has opened up debates and created a far healthier climate for the discussion of urban issues, but formal institutional and procedural changes are far from sufficient to ensure new approaches on the ground. The presence or absence of effective environmental lobbying from community organizations and of environmental champions within the bureaucracy are critical factors. The planning process in Durban, inevitably subject to immediate political pressures, is still far from achieving the more holistic ambition of integrating environmental and developmental concerns.

N2  - We spend over \$100 billion each year on policing in the United States, yet have very little idea of what keeps us safe. From the adoption of new technologies like facial recognition to militarization to stop-and-frisk tactics, and much else, police in the United States pursue public safety strategies without understanding the full range of costs or benefits. There is a particularly troubling tendency to ignore the social costs (the impact policing practices have on individuals)-and the distributional costs (how policing regularly falls most heavily on racial and marginalized communities). As a result, we don't know what keeps us safe, and there is a real risk we are doing more harm than good. This Article asks why we as a society know so little about how to assure safety, and what we can do to change this state of affairs. The Article's thesis is that a variety of dysfunctions around the politics of policing leads to legislative stasis and executive inertia: governing officials simply defer to the police. Blind trust in the police, fear of a powerful police lobby, and a law enforcement culture of secrecy and insulation result in a serious information failure. Legislative and executive officials (and the police themselves) simply lack the information needed to address whether police are doing a good job of keeping the public safe, and so they do little or nothing to assure public safety. The Article proposes a set of solutions to encourage the development of information about policing, including sentinel event review, information forcing legislation, the establishment of regulatory intermediaries, and the creation of a policing college. Its main proposal is to encourage broad use of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) about policing. CBA, though prominently used in other areas of government, is almost nonexistent in the field of policing. Adoption of some combination of some of these tools is essential to ensure just, effective public safety.

An experienced project team was engaged to conduct literature reviews and member consultations, develop resources and implement a targeted advocacy strategy that included a policy launch and meetings with government officials. The Policy Statement and Background Papers have enabled ARATA to represent the views of Assistive Technology (AT) Practitioners in consultations around the National Disability Insurance Scheme and other AT-related inquiries. In ARATA's experience, developing a policy statement and disseminating it through a targeted advocacy strategy is an effective way for a not-for-profit professional organisation to influence government policy.

N2  - Can professional low-level bureaucrats who implement policy act as policy entrepreneurs and affect policy design? Does the transition from traditional, hierarchical administrations to local governance systems play a role in enabling policy entrepreneurship among such low-level bureaucrats? We explore these questions using the case study of waste separation in Israeli local authorities. We maintain that the attributes of local governance can explain their success in affecting policy. Our findings demonstrate how low-level bureaucrats who act as policy entrepreneurs use the structural characteristics of governance as a window of opportunity for reform. When the mode of governance is more lateral and less traditional, these bureaucrats have a better chance of acting as policy entrepreneurs.

N2  - In the modern Russian society, there is a contradiction between the goals and objectives of civil service, its social relevance and applied nature, on the one hand, and the growing dissatisfaction of the population on the other hand. The article describes and analyzes the socio-cultural and value paradigms of civil servants in the Russian Federation, which define the characteristics of their activities. The authors emphasize the importance of a motivational resource such as socio-cultural and value paradigms in the process of reforming the modern institution of civil service. The research results revealed a number of problems. A significant part of the structure of life goals of civil servants is occupied by material interests; according to the respondents' estimates, the activities they do are not related to the categories of ``favorite activity{''}, ``interesting job{''}. Some government employees consider ``service to the Fatherland{''}, ``useful contribution to the society and the state{''} as the main purpose for their professional activity. The research confirmed the hypothesis that the efficiency and effectiveness of occupational work of civil servants depends not only on motivational factors but also on life experience, moral principles, understanding of one's role in the process of implementing the state policy and life strategy. The routine nature of work does not live up to employees' expectations evening political activities and state administration. Bureaucratic values, lack of interaction with the external environment, authoritarian management style, and rigid subordination affect the employee's identity and behavior. Government employees due to personal characteristics and character specifics, assessing themselves and their experience higher at the career ladder, either search for a new position themselves, a different kind of activity to meet their life strategy, or stop developing professionally. Socio-cultural and value paradigms of government employees vary according to the category and group of positions. We also confirmed the hypothesis concerning the category ``experts{''} of leading and senior groups of positions that public service is considered by employees and citizens not as a value-regulatory complex providing interaction between the state and the society in order to meet the interests of the latter, but as a mechanism for achieving financial success.

N2  - Administrative ethics is a common issue in the public management field. With the social development, a series of concept changes have been seen in understanding to public management and definition of ethics. The paper is a review and reflection of the historical and current situations of administrative ethics, which illustrates the value orientation of public interests and the common interests of human race: while enjoying fruits of economy and culture development together, each government should consider how to enhance coordination, to reach an agreement and to avoid disputes, so as to establish a modem governmental mechanism Meanwhile, conscience, responsibility, modem service consciousness for civil servants should be gained; the reality that interest groups impede to share development space on purpose for established interest should be avoided. This paper provides a theoretical thinking and constructs an ethical framework of quadruplet including community, system, government and individuals. The paper also comes up with new ideas about the existing puzzles in administrative ethics.

N2  - Workforce diversity requires broader vision and scope in managing diversity so that there is greater inclusion inside and outside organizations. This paper provides this vision by extending the stream of workforce diversity research to community-oriented inclusion and its processes. The authors interviewed 34 people with disabilities and 40 people without disabilities who were stakeholders of community arts and sports organizations. The participants with disabilities were mainly arts audiences, artists and sports athletes, and the participants without disabilities were mainly managers and government officials. The key findings report the importance of inclusion through common interest groups being facilitated by (1) non-minority specific communal activities, (2) listening to minority voices, (3) multidimensional accessibility, (4) availability of organizational and natural champions and (5) cross-boundary networks and collaborations. In order to create more inclusive organizations, the authors suggest that private organizations need more community-oriented values, goals and strategies that foster boundaryless inclusion of people with disabilities and other minority groups in organizations and society. © 2013 British Academy of Management.

N1  - exclusion criteria: street-level bureaucrats; level (local)
N2  - When climate change policies are implemented in practice, they travel through the hands of a range of practitioners who not only mediate but also potentially transform climate interventions. This article highlights the role of a group of actors whose practices have so far received little attention in the study of climate change governance, namely the public servants who are responsible for the everyday implementation of national climate change policies and associated programmes on the ground. Situated at the frontline of the state and often engaging directly with citizens, these ``interface bureaucrats'' occupy a complex position in which they must balance their role as representatives of the state with the need to accommodate the pressures, interests and practical challenges associated with everyday policy implementation. In this article we examine how interface bureaucrats in Zambia seek to navigate this role as they go about implementing national climate change adaptation policies in practice, and what this means for the nature and outcome of these interventions. We identify key dilemmas of the interface bureaucrats in our study areas, namely (i) intervening with limited reach, (ii) implementing generic policies, and (iii) managing conflicting interests. We show how they address these dilemmas through highly pragmatic practices involving informal agreements with community members, discretionary adjustments of official policies, and negotiation of contested interventions. As a result, the nature and outcomes of climate change adaptation interventions end up differently from the official policies and the underlying governance interests of the central state. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to the role of interface bureaucrats as everyday climate policy makers and point to the significance of pragmatism and compromise in the interaction between state actors and citizens in environmental interventions.

N2  - The World Health Organization urges countries to become more active in advocacy efforts to put mental health on governments' agendas. Health policy makers, planners and managers, advocacy groups, consumer and family organizations, through their different roles and actions, can move the mental health agenda forward. This paper outlines the importance of the advocacy movement, describes some of the roles and functions of the different groups and identifies some specific actions that can be adopted by Ministries of Health. The mental health advocacy movement has developed over the last 30 years as a means of combating stigma and prejudice against people with mental disorders and improving services. Consumer and family organizations and related NGOs have been able to influence governments on mental health policies and laws and educating the public on social integration of people with mental disorders. Governments can promote the development of a strong mental health advocacy sector without compromising this sector's independence. For instance, they can publish and distribute a directory of mental health advocacy groups, include them in their mental health activities and help fledgling groups become more established. There are also some advocacy functions that government officials can, and indeed, should perform themselves. Officials in the ministry of health can persuade officials in other branches of government to make mental health more of a priority, support advocacy activities with both general health workers and mental health workers and carry out public information campaigns about mental disorders and how to maintain good mental health. In conclusion, the World Health Organization believes mental health advocacy is one of the pillars to improve mental health care and the human rights of people with mental disorders. It is hoped that the recommendations in this article will help government officials and activists to strengthen national advocacy movements.

N2  - Prior to the nineteenth century the more lucrative public offices under the direct control of the Crown as part of the civil list were given as sinecures to favoured individuals. The use of these sinecures, pensions and other valuable appointments provided the Crown with the means by which it could buy influence and, thereby, undermine the constitutional authority and independence of parliament. In the main, civilian officers of the Crown were not accountable to parliament. Financial accountability for spending on the civil list was sporadic, without sufficient enforcement mechanisms and, therefore, a threat to the liberty of all "Englishmen". The financial and political strains that the American War of Independence placed upon England, combined with the abuse of patronage privileges by the Crown, provoked a movement for economical reform, most often associated with Edmund Burke, which sought the reform of both the civil list and executive accounts as protections for liberty. Crucial to convincing the government of the urgency of reform were reports from the Commissioners for Examining the Public Accounts. © 2008 SAGE Publications.

N2  - While nonprofit organizations are frequently understood as influencing policy through advocacy, the policy influence of nonprofit service provision has not been widely acknowledged within the context of the policy process. In spite of this oversight, nonprofit organizations have significant discretion over the publicly funded services they provide, and public policy is continuously shaped through nonprofit service delivery. Furthermore, nonprofit organizations frequently embody the roles of interest group and policy implementer simultaneously. The advocate-provider framework presented here situates these concurrent nonprofit functions within the policy process context. This framework connects research and theory across policy process, public management, and nonprofit management scholarship. The advocate-provider perspective challenges assumptions from existing scholarship while highlighting the need for future research that jointly investigates nonprofit advocacy, public service provision, and policy processes.

N2  - Introduction: In the perspectives of implementation of policy, the top-down and bottom-up perspectives of policy-making dominate the discourse. However, service delivery and therefore the experience of the policy by the citizen ultimately depend on the civil servant at the front line to implement the policy. Lipsky named this street-level bureaucracy, which has been used to understand professionals working in the public sector throughout the world. The public sector in South Africa has undergone a number of changes in the transition to a democratic state, post 1994. This needs to be understood in public administration developments throughout the world. At the time of the study, the public sector was characterized by considerable inefficiencies and system failures as well as inequitable distribution of resources. The context of the study was a rural hospital serving a population of approximately 150 000. Methods: An insider-ethnography over a period of 13 months explored the challenges of being a professional within the public sector in a rural hospital in South Africa. Data collection included participant observation, field notes of events and meetings, and documentation review supplemented with in-depth interviews of doctors working at a rural hospital. Street-level bureaucracy was used as a framework to understand the challenges of being a professional and civil servant in the public sector. Results: The context of a resource-constrained setting was seen as a major limitation to delivering a quality service. Yet considerable evidence pointed to doctors (both individually and collectively) being active in managing the services in the context and aiming to achieve optimal health service coverage for the population. In the daily routine of the work, doctors often advocated for patients and went beyond the narrow definitions of the guidelines. They compensated for failing systems, beyond a local interpretation of policy. However, doctors also at times used their discretion negatively, to avoid work or to contribute to the inefficiencies of healthcare delivery. Conclusions: While appearing to be in conflict, the merging of the roles of the health professional and the bureaucrat is required to be able to function effectively within the healthcare system. Being a doctor and being a civil servant are synergistic in daily work, and as a result it is difficult to neatly differentiate professional and civil servant roles in decision-making. It is in the discretion of both roles that considerable flexibility within the roles is possible. Such freedom to act is critical for being able to find local solutions and thereby improve healthcare services. The findings resonate strongly with studies from other parts of the world and offer a window into making sense of the local decision making of doctors. Street-level bureaucracy remains an important lens to view the work of healthcare professionals in the public sector. In the tension between the top-down policy-making and the bottom-up pressure, street-level bureaucracy acts as an important terrain for improving the implementation of services and therefore advocacy and health system improvement.

N2  - The District Poverty Initiatives Project (DPIP) in India was launched in a few states in recent years with a view to ensuring that the most disadvantaged or the poorest have a central role in the design and implementation of subprojects vital to their livelihoods. An elaborate organisational structure at the state, district and village levels was created to give local needs and priorities due attention. Since the most disadvantaged lack awareness of various options and organisational skills, capacity-building of common interest groups is a key strategic element of the DPIP. Another key element is the attitudinal and behavioural transformation of various stakeholders - especially bureaucrats and elected representatives at the village level - through sensitisation programmes. That these innovations may make a difference to the lives of the most disadvantaged cannot be ruled out. However, some risks of so-called community or demand-driven initiatives must not be overlooked, including bureaucratic control and interference at the state and district levels that could result in supply side distortions, and panchayats (councils) at the village level that could cater to the interests of the local power structure, and common interest groups that could exclude the poorest. Unless the poorest have the collective strength to affirm their interests, they are not likely to benefit much from the DPIP.

N2  - This paper aims to determine where the Hungarian civil service system might be situated on an imaginary merit system-spoils system scale. In doing so, the Hungarian system is analyzed from two angles. Firstly, regulation is scrutinized as it is manifested in the Civil Service Act. Secondly, practice is examined relying on available statistical and survey data. The author argues that, contrary to the conclusions of most of scholarly publications, the Hungarian Law is a pseudo-merit system law, not in fact preventing the prevalence of a spoils system. Practice generally reveals, however, features of a modestly politicized system with signs of increasing professionalization. The last two sections investigate the potential explanations for these somewhat surprising findings and whether the findings for the Hungarian civil service may be generalized to some or most of the Central and East European countries.

N2  - The term ``lobbyism{''} comes from the English word ``lobby{''} meaning a narrow corridor in English Parliament (building) where deputies could communicate in an informal situation. The political shade got this term only at the end of the XVIII century in the United States of America. At the beginning of the 1820th years the term ``lobbyism{''} was used for definition of local groups, influencing the authorities of the country for the purpose of advance of own interests. Nowadays the USA is the only state in the world that secures lobbying constitutionally and regulates it by means of various federal laws. At the same time each US state has its own regulations establishing the rules for lobbying activities. Despite the federal law lobbying is still banned in some states. This is not surprising since the USA has fifty governments, various political subcultures and levels of political and economic development, so in each state the experience of lobbying regulation has its own characteristics. It is also important to note that the state supervision of lobbying is limited by four fundamental functions: 1) establishing general requirements for registration; 2) establishing criteria for defining a professional lobbyist; 3) establishing of common reporting mechanisms. American states oversight of lobbying generally takes four forms. States establish registration requirements by defining what lobbying is and who is a lobbyist; they require lobbyists or the interests that hire them to periodically disclose their expenditures and earnings; they regulate the `revolving door' between government and the private sector by establishing a cooling-off period during which ex-government officials are prohibited from lobbying the government they once served and they define the range of permissible lobbying activities, such as providing free gifts or meals. As we can see, there are substantial differences across the varying American States when it comes to regulating lobbyists and lobbying behavior. Moreover because of the importance of State government in the United States, regulations at the state level are in many ways equally if not more important than the federal regulations.

N2  - Authoritarian regimes usually operate under an official legal order, either maintaining a past democratic constitution (e.g., the 1935 constitution during Marcos's early years in the Philippines) or creating a new constitution (e.g., Yushin constitution under Park in South Korea). While constitutions in these contexts often are viewed as “shams” or a form of “window dressing,” this may, in fact, not always be the case. Barros (2002) details how the 1980 constitution in Chile - the military's own creation - constrained the junta and ultimately paved the way for the transition to democracy. Albertus and Menaldo (2011), more generally in Latin America, find that some dictators construct greater institutional constraints to their authority through constitutions and, as a result, survive in power longer. In this way, constitutions are another power-sharing device that enables authoritarian leaders and elites to prolong their rule (Myerson 2008; Svolik 2009). Incumbents, however, are not the only ones influenced by constitutional rules under authoritarianism. Constitutions also shape the strategies of opposition parties when they compete in authoritarian elections. While authoritarian incumbents attempt to use their “menu of manipulation” to ensure electoral victory, opposition parties must decide how best to challenge these regimes (Schedler 2006). One decision parties must make is whether to form preelectoral pacts in an effort to defeat the incumbent (Howard and Roessler 2006; Van de Walle 2006). In the case of presidential elections, coalitions form when several parties agree to support one candidate for the election in exchange for cabinet positions and other political appointments.

N2  - Drawing on experimental games and surveys conducted with students at two universities in Russia, we compare the behavioral, attitudinal, and demographic traits of students seeking public sector employment to the traits of their peers seeking jobs in the private sector. Contrary to similar studies conducted in other high-corruption contexts, such as India, we find evidence that students who prefer a public sector career display less willingness to cheat or bribe in experimental games as well as higher levels of altruism. However, disaggregating public sector career paths reveals distinctions between the federal civil service and other types of public sector employment, with federal government positions attracting students who exhibit some similarities with their peers aspiring to private sector careers. We discuss multiple interpretations consistent with our findings, each of which has implications for the creation of effective anti-corruption policies and for understanding of state capacity in contexts where corruption is widespread. © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - This chapter analyzes how corruption has resulted in part from poorly instituted land laws and the dynamics of factionalism. South Sudan has failed to institute functional institutions; institutions which could have initiated peace-guaranteeing conditions, ensure national cohesion, and spur economic development and prosperity. This has created war-enabling conditions and made peace and security almost impossible to realize. Some of the reasons advanced by experts, foreign diplomats and other stakeholders with intimate knowledge of South Sudanese history, include lack of political will, militarized mentality, political and economic patronage, tribalized politics, kleptocracy, and the general desire to amass wealth. While the mentioned causal factors have undermined state formation and institutional structures, this article contends that the current South Sudanese political quagmire stemmed from a lack of disciplined and conscientious leadership that could have dealt with the above mentioned problems. The chapter aims to show how the lack of leadership undermined nascent institutional structures and protocols as leaders failed (or didn’t know how) to give problems context, guide civil servants, and prescribe fact-based governance models. A sound leadership, notwithstanding lack of experienced local civil servants and nascent institutional structures, would have strategized in a manner that focuses on addressing state shortcomings in consistent, forward-looking modalities outlined in the South Sudan Development Plan (2011-2013). © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Steven C.

N2  - This essay examines the political practices observed in the relationships between the state and civil society that developed during the process of decentralization in Venezuela. One of the objectives of the process was transforming the representative democracy established by the National Constitution of 1961 into the participatory democracy institutionalized by the constitution adopted in December 1999. It will analyze whether the practices that maintain the relationship between the decentralized municipality and organized civil society are those of clientelism, semiclientelism, or citizenship, the latter understood as participation in the decision-making process in order to create public policies for the efficient and equitable distribution of scarce resources. Consequently, it will not only identify the new practices but also examine the role that both the old and new practices play in the recently decentralized local structures. The following questions will be explored: Are the practices of clientelism intrinsic to the decentralization model that is being applied in Latin America, or are they a result of an incomplete implementation of that model? Are these practices characteristic of all socio-political actors, or are they differentiated according to social class? Are they a response to the absence of some of the prerequisites for democratic decentralization, such as the existence of democratizing social movements, changes in the political culture or underlying political model, and the transformation of the legal or institutional framework? Is decentralization solely a managerial readjustment, or is it truly a qualitative heightening and strengthening of democracy? Are the practices of clientelism involving social or interest groups a new form of clientelism? And, finally, is this new form of clientelism a product of decentralization in a country that is undergoing a profound political and economic crisis? We will study the practices of the strategic political and social actors on the local government level-the mayor, town council members, neighborhood associations, and administrative bureaucracy-and focus on clientelism, personalism, and absenteeism.

N2  - Despite widespread critiques of ‘political spin’, the way governments engage with the mass media has attracted relatively little empirical attention. There is a small but growing body of research into bureaucracies’ responses to mediatisation from within which have identified tensions between bureaucratic and party political values, but this has not included the United Kingdom. There are concerns that the traditional dividing line between government information and political propaganda has come under increasing pressure as a higher premium is placed on persuasion by both journalists and politicians battling for public attention in an increasingly competitive market. Within Whitehall, the arrival of Labour in 1997 after 18 years in opposition was a watershed for UK government communications, allowing the government to reconfigure its official information service in line with the party political imperative to deploy strategic communications as a defence against increasingly invasive media scrutiny. Public relations, in government as elsewhere, has grown in scale, scope and status, becoming institutionalised and normalised within state bureaucracies, but how has this affected the role, status and influence of the civil servants who conduct media management? Within the system of executive self-regulation of government publicity that is characteristic of Whitehall, government press officers must negotiate a difficult path between the need to inform citizens about the government’s programme, and demands by ministers to deploy privileged information to secure and maintain personal and party advantage in the struggle for power. Taking 1997 as a turning point, and through the voices of the actors who negotiate government news – mainly press officers, but also journalists and special advisers – this article examines the changing role and position of Whitehall press officers in what has become known as the age of political spin, finding that profound and lasting change in the rules of engagement has taken place and is continuing.

N2  - Writings on post-war Japanese politics have tended to take for granted the dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as inevitable, without questioning how this came about. This book analyses the nature of Japanese party politics over the first four decades following the Second World War, assessing how the chief contenders - the conservative LDP and the socialists JSP (Japan Socialist Party) - competed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses relative to the other. Throughout, it addresses the questions: How effectively were the parties' strengths harnessed? How did they alter over time? To what extent was the winning formula challenged? Did the loser have access to strengths with a major potential, and, if so, why did these remain underdeveloped? It extends widely to include discussion of the political system, the social and economic environment in which parties operated, internal party matters, especially factions, personal support groups, special interest groups, and the role of government bureaucracy. It shows why the Liberal Democratic Party was dominant, why the Japan Socialist Party remained out of power, and how successive prime ministers conducted policymaking in ways which often resulted in the bureaucracy taking the lead. Overall, the book shows how precedents for the political system and for policymaking were set in this important period, precedents which continue, and which have contributed significantly to the present conservative stance on many key issues.

N2  - Background: The political activities of industry stakeholders must be understood to safeguard the development and implementation of effective public health policies. Methods: A quantitative descriptive study was performed using data from Canada’s Registry of Lobbyists to examine the frequency and governmental target of lobbying that occurred between various types of stakeholders (i.e., industry versus non-industry) and designated public office holders (DPOH) regarding Health Canada’s Healthy Eating Strategy, from September/2016 to January/2021. Initiatives of interest were revisions to Canada’s Food Guide, changes to the nutritional quality of the food supply, front-of-pack nutrition labelling and restrictions on food marketing to children. Results: The majority of registrants (88%), and corporations and organizations (90%) represented in lobbying registrations had industry ties. Industry-affiliated stakeholders were responsible for 86% of communications with DPOH, interacting more frequently with DPOH of all ranks, compared to non-industry stakeholders. Most organizations and corporations explicitly registered to lobby on the topic of marketing to children (60%), followed by Canada’s Food Guide (48%), front-of-pack nutrition labelling (44%), and the nutritional quality of the food supply (23%). The food and beverage industry, particularly the dairy industry, was the most active, accounting for the greatest number of lobbying registrations and communications, followed by the media and communication industry. Conclusions: Results suggest a strategic advantage of industry stakeholders in influencing Canadian policymakers. While some safeguards have been put in place, increased transparency would allow for a better understanding of industry discourse and help protect public health interests during the policy development process. © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - In this paper, we take a Public Choice perspective to identify and
categorise barriers to efficient public climate adaptation.
Specifically, we distinguish three dimensions of public adaptation:
extent, structure (form and timing) and organisation (coordination
across territorial authorities and policy fields). Within each of these
dimensions, we investigate how the self-interest of voters, pressure
groups, bureaucrats and politicians may bias adaptation decisions. Thus,
we indicate specific barriers to efficient public adaptation. Based on
this framework, we illustrate how Germany's response to major flood
disasters reflects the incentive structure of concerned stakeholders and
their political interaction. The ad hoc character of some public
adaptation measures implies a clear bias from the efficient benchmark.
In conclusion, we argue that the propositions of Public Choice theory
shed some light on how empirical public adaptation processes unfold.

N2  - The paper focuses on the changing ethical template that programmes of 'responsive' or 'entrepreneurial' managerial reform require of civil servants. Contemporary demands for responsive public management contain two emotional injunctions to public bureaucrats. The first, derived from populist doctrines of political right, requires bureaucrats to be responsive to the needs of their 'clients'. In the name of 'recognition' and the 'politics of care', for example, it is thought vital to inculcate in bureaucratic conduct a sense of 'compassion' or close identification with others' feelings. Secondly, in the name of responsiveness to political superiors and the delivery of their policy objectives, bureaucrats are expected to exhibit 'ownership' of and identification with particular policies. They are required to be committed champions for and enthusiastic advocates of those policies. Both of these injunctions are deemed to be more in tune with democratic principles and the currents of contemporary ethical culture ('diversity' or 'human rights', for example) than what is represented as the unlamented Weberian world of rule-bound hierarchy. The paper seeks to question this assessment.

N2  - What should be the primary goals of a judicial appointments system, and how much weight should be placed on diversity in particular? Why is achieving a diverse judiciary across the UK taking so long? Is it time for positive action? What role should the current judiciary play in the appointment of our future judges? There is broad agreement within the UK and other common law countries that diversity raises important questions for a legal system and its officials, but much less agreement about the full implications of recognising diversity as an important goal of the judicial appointments regime. Opinions differ, for example, on the methods, forms, timing and motivations for judicial diversity. To mark the tenth anniversary of the creation of the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) in England and Wales, this collection includes contributions from current and retired judges, civil servants, practitioners, current and former commissioners on the JAC and leading academics from Australia, Canada, South Africa and across the UK. Together they provide timely and authoritative insights into past, current and future debates on the search for diversity in judicial appointments. Topics discussed include the role and responsibility of independent appointment bodies; assessments of the JAC's first ten years; appointments to the UK Supreme Court; the pace of change; definitions of 'merit' and 'diversity'; mandatory retirement ages; the use of ceiling quotas; and the appropriate role of judges and politicians in the appointments process.

N2  - While there may be several practical concerns regarding the practice of corporate lobbying of government officials, there is the more basic question of a corporation’s moral right to do so. I argue that group agents such as corporations have no moral rights, and thereby cannot have the right to lobby. There may be a basis for some legal rights for corporations, but I argue that lobbying cannot be one of the legal rights, even by reference to the rights of the individuals that make up the corporation. I end the paper by a discussion of how this argument applies to all private organizations, including public interest organizations.

N2  - Why and when do businessmen run for public office rather than rely upon other means of influence? What are the implications of their participation for public policy? We show formally that "businessman candidacy" and public policy are jointly determined by the institutional environment. When institutions that hold elected officials accountable to voters are strong, businessmen receive little preferential treatment and are disinclined to run for office. When such institutions are weak, businessmen can subvert policy irrespective of whether they hold office, but they may run for office to avoid the cost of lobbying elected officials. Evidence from Russian gubernatorial elections supports the model's predictions. Businessman candidates emerge in regions with low media freedom and government transparency, institutions that raise the cost of reneging on campaign promises. Among regions with weaker institutions, professional politicians crowd out businessmen when the rents from office are especially large.

N2  - Idrîs-i Bidlîsî (1457-1520) is undoubtedly one of the most original and important intellectual figures in the 16th-century Ottoman world. As a bureaucrat and historian of Iranian provenance, he lived in a very turbulent period of the Ottoman-Aqquyunlu, Ottoman-Mamluk and Ottoman-Safavid rivalry [rivalries] at the end of the 15th century and at the beginning of the 16th century. He established relationships at different times with each of these four dynasties which were hostile to each other. Although he is remembered for being under the patronage of Bayezid II and Selim I, in fact he attempted to seek patronage of different dynasties in this political atmosphere. No doubt one of the potential patrons was Shah Ismail. In the light of a recently discovered document this article discusses Bidlîsî’s aim to find a new patron in the person of the Shah, an idea he conceived in Istanbul after leaving Bayezid II’s patronage, during his sojourn in Mecca where he travelled for realizing this aim. © 2015, ISAM, Turkish Religious Foundation Centre for Islamic Studies.

N2  - A bureaucrat and historian of Iranian origin, Idris-i Bidlisi (b. Ray/Iran 1457–d. Istanbul 1520), is undoubtedly one of the most original and important intellectual figures in the Ottoman‒Iranian borderland in the sixteenth century. He lived in a very turbulent period and established different relationships with Iranian and Ottoman dynasties at the end of the fifteenth century and at the beginning of the sixteenth century. He and his works have been the focus of long-standing historical debates in Turkey that have continued to the present day. Until now, most modern scholarly works on Bidlisi have failed to provide a proper, in-depth textual and historical analysis. As a result, such modern works have come to present a skewed, romanticized image of Bidlisi, largely detached from the nature and dynamics of the historical context in which Bidlisi lived and evolved as an intellectual and writer. This paper provides a realistic appraisal of Bidlisi and discusses the shortcomings of modern historiography on him. By looking at Bidlisi and his corpus, and more specifically at the ways in which the latter was shaped by Bidlisi’s patronage relationships, the paper aims to open up a window into Bidlisi’s evolving mindset and worldview. In other words, through an in-depth analysis of his corpus and new archival sources the paper strives to unveil the intellectual life and career of an Iranian bureaucrat and historian positioned between Ottoman‒Iranian borderland and provide a glimpse into the nature of patronage in the sixteenth century. © 2019, © 2019 Association For Iranian Studies, Inc.

N2  - This paper studies the link between public policy and corruption for the case of wind energy. We show that publicly subsidized renewable energy can attract criminal appetites and favor the formation of criminal associations between entrepreneurs and politicians able to influence the licensing process. The insights of a simple model of political influence by interest groups are tested empirically using Italian data for the years 1990–2007. Using a difference in difference approach we quantify the impact of a Green Certificate policy aimed at supporting renewables, and find robust evidence that criminal association activity increased more in windy provinces after the introduction of the generous policy regime. The magnitude of the effect is large: the construction of an average wind park is associated with an increase in criminal activity of 6 % in the treatment compared to the control group. Our findings show that in the presence of poor institutions, even well designed market-based policies can have an adverse impact. The analysis is relevant for countries that are generally characterized by heavy bureaucracies, weak institutions and by large renewable potential.

N2  - The good governance argument for diversity in civil service is based on the notion that creating a bureaucracy that represents the diverse communities it serves strengthens government accountability and legitimacy. This paper argues that ethnic representation in national bureaucratic governance in the Philippines primarily constitutes a means for political reallocation of space, as it is embedded in the government’s framework of asymmetric political autonomy. Mired in intersecting political and ethnic tensions (i.e. blurred ethnic distinctions/ethnic identity disputes and politico-ethnic conflicts), patrimonial forces could easily exploit the country’s bureaucratic representation policies as spaces for patronage and as superficial tokens to mollify interethnic factions of their share of the national polity. Thus, instead of facilitating equitable voice in bureaucratic governance, such policy framework could only hold ordinary indigenous and minority ethnic communities captive in the elite-dominated interethnic struggle for representation.

N2  - ``Predatory policing{''} occurs where police officers mainly use their authority to advance their own material interests rather than to fight crime or protect the interests of elites. These practices have the potential to seriously compromise the public's trust in the police and other legal institutions, such as courts. Using data from six surveys and nine focus groups conducted in Russia, we address four empirical questions: (1) How widespread are public encounters with police violence and police corruption in Russia? (2) To what extent does exposure to these two forms of police misconduct vary by social and economic characteristics? (3) How do Russians perceive the police, the courts, and the use of violent methods by the police? (4) How, if at all, do experiences of police misconduct affect these perceptions? Our results suggest that Russia conforms to a model of predatory policing. Despite substantial differences in its law enforcement institutions and cultural norms regarding the law, Russia resembles the United States in that direct experiences of police abuse reduce confidence in the police and in the legal system more generally. The prevalence of predatory policing in Russia has undermined Russia's democratic transition, which should call attention to the indispensable role of the police and other public institutions in the success of democratic reforms.

N2  - Anecdotal evidence of agencies burying bad news is rife in law and politics. The bureaucracy regularly is accused of announcing controversial policies on holidays and weekends when public attention is elsewhere. We show that this conventional wisdom is wrong, or at least significantly incomplete. The conventional wisdom is riddled with theoretical holes, and there is little systematic empirical evidence to support it. After critiquing the conventional account of agencies hiding bad news, we articulate and defend a revised theory of strategic timing in administrative law. We argue that timing decisions rarely affect the visibility of decisions but can drive up the costs of monitoring and responding for interest groups and legislative coalitions. Agency discretion to choose when to announce policy decisions can even allow agencies to influence which interest groups monitor the regulatory process and therefore whose preferences must be taken into account. We evaluate both the conventional wisdom and our revised theory using twenty-five years of empirical evidence. We then develop the implications for administrative law doctrine and institutional design of the bureaucracy.

N2  - While corporate political activity is increasing, its effects on firms' marketing-relevant outcomes have been largely overlooked in the literature. We propose that corporate lobbying will decrease a firm's emphasis on product safety and, in turn, increase its product recalls. We further propose that the positive indirect effect of corporate lobbying on a firm's product recalls via lower emphasis on product safety will be moderated by the firm's (a) CEO's functional background and (b) focus on radical (vs. incremental) innovation. We provide empirical support for the proposed model using data on 86 U.S. medical device firms from 2005-2018. The findings extend the literature on the effects of non-market forces on firms' marketing-relevant outcomes. They also extend the literature on the antecedents of product recalls, which has, hitherto, overlooked the role of non-market forces. The findings on the moderating roles of the firm's marketing CEO and focus on radical (vs. incremental) innovation generate actionable managerial implications.

N2  - I use a formal model to analyze the effect of civil service protections on bureaucratic performance. In a two-period model, a public manager observes a bureaucrat's actions for a period and decides whether to retain or attempt to remove the bureaucrat. Bureaucrats vary in terms of their intrinsic motivation and choose between careers in government or the private sector. I show that bureaucratic performance is greater in any separating equilibrium in which motivated bureaucrats choose government than in all equilibria in which they do not. Stronger civil service protections reduce the amount of effort that motivated bureaucrats must exert to distinguish themselves from their unmotivated peers in order to ensure retention. This strengthens incentives for motivated bureaucrats to choose careers in government. Stronger civil service protections, however, also reduce the ability of public managers to remove unmotivated bureaucrats. These competing effects yield a non-monotonic and discontinuous relationship between civil service protections and bureaucratic performance. I use the model to analyze recent reforms to U.S. state and federal personnel management that have significantly rolled back traditional job protections.

N2  - “Messy” democratic political institutions might generate ineffective conservation policy watered down by competing interest groups and rival political parties. A hardcore environmentalist may believe that a pro-conservation dictatorship would be the type government best able to meet her goals. Such an environmental fantasy became reality in Zambia under President (1972-1991) Kenneth Kaunda. But despite his dictatorial powers, he did not have much success in curbing the poaching epidemic that swept through Zambia in the 1970s and 80s. The structure of the one-party state, together with a fall in the price of Zambia’s principal export (copper) and a concomitant increase in the value of many wildlife products, created an environment that generated incentives for politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens to disregard Kaunda. This analysis challenges conventional wisdom about the politics of one-party states. It shows that even in the case of one-party government, the structure of political institutions remains critical to the extent of a dictator’s control. © 2000 The Swiss Political Science Review.

N2  - Background Community-based distribution (CBD) of injectable contraceptives has increased access to family planning for millions of women in rural areas in resource-limited settings. Despite the evidence of the success of this contraceptive delivery method, many nations have yet to integrate CBD into their family planning policies. The aim of this paper to describe the process through which PATH spearheaded efforts to successfully advocate for policy change to authorize non-clinical personnel in Zambia to provide injectable contraceptives. Methods We describe a four-part framework for policy advocacy: (a) evidence building and technical assistance, (b) stakeholder engagement, (c) government engagement, and (d) knowledge dissemination. Results Advocacy for policy change to allow CBD of injectable contraceptives was long and iterative. Evidence to support advocacy efforts was built through a Zambian delegates' study tour to Rwanda to witness Rwanda's robust CBD program and a rapid assessment of Zambian pilot sites where non-clinical personnel were administering injectable contraceptives. Advocacy was led by PATH in partnership with key stakeholders from the Zambia Family Planning Technical Working Group (FPWTG), key government officials, and a special task force of stakeholders focused on advocating for CBD of injectable contraceptives. This task force used evidence from the study tour and rapid site assessment in national and international forums to demonstrate the beneficial effects of allowing non-clinical personnel to administer injectable contraceptives. The Zambian government authorized the policy change in 2016. Conclusion The policy advocacy efforts of PATH. FPWTG, and the special task force demonstrate the need for an ample evidence base and sustained engagement of government and stakeholder groups.

N2  - Representative bureaucracy theory expects minority bureaucrats to advance the interests of minority citizens. Yet, little attention has been given to the variation in the acceptability, incentives and risks of representation across bureaucratic domains. Analysis of over two million police vehicle stops from four different US departments reveals that African American police officers do not treat African Americans preferentially, yet they mitigate existing racial disparities in policing. Compared with White officers, African Americans seem less disposed to use their discretion. They are disinclined to search drivers, yet inclined to cite them, displaying comparatively low disparities across social groups. These findings extend to pure traffic violations, and are robust to entropy balancing reweighting. We provisionally attribute African American police officers' impartial policing style to their compelling need to display their performance, and avoid blame, amidst intra-organizational pressures and risks ensuing from the political salience of the police's clash with minority communities.

N2  - Based on my encounters with the Indian censor board while trying to get my films approved for broadcast on Indian television, I explore how bureaucratic institutions such as the Indian Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) operate as instruments of the nation-state to control speech, regulate culture, and stifle dissent in the interest of advancing the Indian government's nationalist, paternalist, heteronormative agendas and policies. I also look briefly at how nongovernmental actors like special interest religious and political groups attempt to regulate even the transnational domains of media circulation online, which offer some possibilities for transcending the regulatory mechanisms of the nation-state.

N2  - This study exposes a unique model of journalism–“obsessive-activist” reporting. Motivated by a strong sense of justice and a passion to make a significant change, these journalists promote their social or political agenda in both spheres: the professional and the public. In the professional, they do it through an obsessive and continuing reporting on the issue they care for, while in the public sphere, they are personally involved in activities such as lobbying and consulting politicians and bureaucrats, or personal assistance to individuals and groups in need. Based on a thorough review of literature on journalism models and on studies of journalistic role perceptions, and after a series of in-depth interviews with 17 obsessive-activist journalists, the authors suggest that obsessive-activist journalism is a unique model of journalism and the most interventionist one. However, unlike other interventionist models of journalism, the obsessive-activist journalists adhere most of the time to traditional journalistic norms and practices. While former interventionist models challenged mainstream news reporting from outside, obsessive activists hybridize it from the inside, adding new avenues to adjust and survive in rapidly changing news environments.

N2  - This study investigates the policy process through which net neutrality
(NN) policy in Israel has been shaped. The analysis employs a framework
based on the Internet Governance concept and the multi-stakeholder
approach. Based on the analysis of formal documents, debates in
parliamentary committees and the Parliament plenum, and position papers
of various actors, the findings show that NN policy in Israel is one
more layer of the neo-liberal policy in the telecommunication sector. It
is demonstrated how experts and bureaucrats, influenced by industry
interests, have been dominant during the policy process while civil
society groups representing the public interests have been only marginal
actors. The paper concludes with a call for a more proactive attitude of
all stakeholder groups in order to enable a more balanced governance of
central internet issues, such as NN.

N2  - Over the last three decades, the United States has increasingly devolved social policy decisions from the federal to the state level. These changes have resulted in substantial variation in policy decisions and related outcomes. Just as the changes allow states to act as policy laboratories, they also offer a window into the process by which organized interests take advantage of such opportunities to influence state-level policy. This study uses the Advocacy Coalition Framework to illuminate the black box of policy change with a comparative study of two states, Washington and Pennsylvania, which adopted "Employment First" policy aimed at prioritizing employment services for individuals with disability. The study reveals that policy change in both states was associated with organized stakeholder mobilization, strategic framing and narrative, and bureaucratic activism, all in an environment of heightened stakeholder attention to the issue. That said, the two states followed distinct paths, with early policy change in Washington stemming from service provider mobilization, suggesting the importance of policy feedback mechanisms.

N2  - Networks are a catalyst for promoting common goals and objectives of their membership. Public Health networks in Africa are crucial, because of the severe resource limitations that nations face in dealing with priority public health problems. For a long time, networks have existed on the continent and globally, but many of these are disease-specific with a narrow scope. The African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) is a public health network established in 2005 as a non-profit networking alliance of Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programs (FELTPs) and Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs) in Africa. AFENET is dedicated to helping ministries of health in Africa build strong, effective and sustainable programs and capacity to improve public health systems by partnering with global public health experts. The Network's goal is to strengthen field epidemiology and public health laboratory capacity to contribute effectively to addressing epidemics and other major public health problems in Africa. AFENET currently networks 12 FELTPs and FETPs in sub-Saharan Africa with operations in 20 countries. AFENET has a unique tripartite working relationship with government technocrats from human health and animal sectors, academicians from partner universities, and development partners, presenting the Network with a distinct vantage point. Through the Network, African nations are making strides in strengthening their health systems. Members are able to: leverage resources to support field epidemiology and public health laboratory training and service delivery notably in the area of outbreak investigation and response as well as disease surveillance; by-pass government bureaucracies that often hinder and frustrate development partners; and consolidate efforts of different partners channelled through the FELTPs by networking graduates through alumni associations and calling on them to offer technical support in various public health capacities as the need arises. AFENET presents a bridging platform between governments and the private sector, allowing for continuity of health interventions at the national and regional level while offering free exit and entry for existing and new partners respectively. AFENET has established itself as a versatile networking model that is highly responsive to members' needs. Based on the successes recorded in AFENET's first 5 years, we envision that the Network's membership will continue to expand as new training programs are established. The lessons learned will be useful in initiating new programs and building sustainability frameworks for FETPs and FELTPs in Africa. AFENET will continue to play a role in coordinating, advocacy, and building capacity for epidemic disease preparedness and response.

N2  - Throughout the 1990s, health advocates engaged in a significant mobilization against the dangers of tobacco use and the tobacco industry. In 1993, the tobacco industry countermobilized through the National Smokers Alliance (NSA), a public relations created front group funded by the tobacco industry, which operated nationally from 1994 to 1999 to advocate for adults using tobacco products without vigorous regulation or increased tobacco taxes. The mobilization by health groups utilized traditional political lobbying and education of the public and public officials without a national public relations created front group to mold public opinion. The countermobilization by the NSA was based on traditional lobbying approaches in conjunction with the use of the public relations oriented consent engineering theory of Edward Bernays, Harold Lasswell, and others. This consent engineering theory calls for public relations specialists using public relations to mold public opinion to support a client's preferred public policy outputs. Despite the use of traditional lobbying in conjunction with the use of public relations efforts, attempts by the NSA to dominate public policy to weaken or neutralize stronger tobacco regulations and taxes were effective only for some campaigns.

N2  - From 1990 to 2005, U.S. state legislation on secondhand tobacco smoke significantly increased in eight public areas: general public areas, government buildings, private workplaces, schools, child care facilities, health care facilities, restaurants, and bars. Despite the U.S. Surgeon General's proclaiming in 2006 that "rapid progress" is being made in state legislation on clean indoor air, vigorous state smoke-free secondhand tobacco smoke legislation in six public area categories was minimal, which has favored the policy agenda of the corporate tobacco lobby. Two exceptions include smoke-free legislation for child care facilities and schools. While public interest group health advocates have traditionally used insider lobbying of public officials in the "halls of power" to pass smoke-free legislation, this should be supplemented with astute outsider advocacy tactics such as public demonstrations or issue advertisements to increase the likelihood of passage of more state-level smoke-free legislation.

N2  - Objective: This paper examines policy processes regarding why the USA and Norway have not regulated coumarin in tobacco. Design: A qualitative analysis of all tobacco industry documents regarding coumarin since the 1950s from the 1998 US Master Settlement Agreement and subsequent legal settlements. Additional data were collected from newspaper reports, general internet search engines, journal articles, scholarly reports, court cases, statutes, regulations, and informal correspondence with tobacco control experts in Norway. Main outcome measure: An overview, summary, and analysis of all documents related to coumarin. Results: In the USA from 1954 until 1985 when coumarin was reportedly removed from domestic cigarettes, but not from pipe tobacco until 1996, and not at all from imported Indian bidi cigarettes, regulatory efforts were stymied. In Norway, from 1973 to the present, the tobacco industry has never disclosed whether its tobacco products contain coumarin. In both the USA and Norway, the extreme delay and lack of vigorous evidence gathering and significant remedies were caused by tobacco industry assertions that revealing tobacco additives was a violation of trade secrets, and by weak regulatory authority and efforts to regulate coumarin. Conclusion: Vigorous and expeditious regulatory investigations and remedies for harmful additives in tobacco, such as coumarin, can protect the public health. Astute insider and outsider political advocacy by health advocates is required to hold elected officials and civil servants publicly accountable for failing to enact disclosure laws and to engage in effective regulatory efforts.

N2  - Objectives. This investigation sought to define policy and political factors related to the undermining of Florida's successful Tobacco Pilot Program in 1999. Methods. Data were gathered from interviews with public health lobbyists, tobacco control advocates, and state officials; news reports; and public documents. Results. As a result of a recent legal settlement with Florida, the tobacco industry agreed to fund a youth anti- smoking pilot program. The program combined community-based interventions and advertisements. In less than 1 year, the teen smoking prevalence rate dropped from 23.3% to 20.9%. The program also enjoyed high public visibility and strong public support. Nevertheless, in 1999, the state legislature cut the program's funding from $70.5 million to $38.7 million, and the Bush administration dismantled the program's administrative structure. Voluntary health agencies failed to publicly hold specific legislators and the governor responsible for the cuts. Conclusions. The legislature and administration succeeded in dismantling this highly visible and successful tobacco control program because pro-health forces limited their activities to behind-the- scenes lobbying and were unwilling to confront the politicians who made these decisions in a public forum.

This chapter maps out a complex network of government and political communication approaches in order to focus on the role that public sector communication plays in politics and policy. It identifies public sector communicators as the nonpartisan messengers of political issues. The challenges of politicization and permanent campaigning and the opportunities to participate in policy development and implementation are discussed. Public sector communication is distinguished as a specific field of knowledge and practice that has its own functions and challenges in its contribution to democratic processes.

N2  - This paper unearths an alternative paradigm through which to consider the discussions and debates between members of the Indian public, government bureaucrats and Congress Party politicians about the rights and interests of Indian citizens both before and immediately after India's Independence in 1947. It argues that much of the recent historical work on citizenship during this period has been preoccupied with issues of nationality and religious community as a result of the fallout from Partition. However, the demands and deliberations over the introduction of provincial forms of affirmative action in the all-India services at this time are indicative of a different narrative. First, many provincial representations of `minority' rights often took into account differences of caste and language instead. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the term minority was employed not only to describe demographic minority status, but also to define under-represented groups in the all-India services. In doing so, these different provincial policies prioritised particular local rights to representation, in which citizenship was expressed through a regional idiom.

N2  - Objective: Media plays a major role in inculcating positive changes or averting negative changes in health-related behaviors across populations. Although various mass media interventions have proven their effectiveness in changing individuals' behavior for various diseases and risk factors, current literature is limited regarding a conceptual framework/model for the prevention of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The present study describes the process of development and implementation of a comprehensive and need-based media strategy with an aim to generate politico-administrative support for strengthening hypertension services in the state of Punjab, India. Methods: The preparation of theoretical framework underwent two stages, that is, item generation and item reduction. The item generation involved extensive literature search, development of consensus among experts using Delphi technique and its validation. The item reduction involved the selection of models among existing communication and health promotion models, placement of items in the selected models and development of final conceptual framework model. Results: Based upon the review and expert's consensus, we zeroed in on three models of communication - communication campaign model, paid earned social owned model, and staircase model - in order to come up with the framework requisite for a systematic media strategy. The model focused upon context-specific messages involving both traditional and modern means and tools of communication. This model (conceptual framework) was the product of intense literature review followed by opinion of the experts from various disciplines such as medical professionals, public health specialists, communication experts, social scientists, politicians, bureaucrats, state-level representatives, media journalists and hypertensive patients. Conclusion: The present model can effectively be used by the program implementers, educators and policy makers in similar settings.

N2  - In Weberian scholarship, conventional wisdom views the corruption of the modern rational-legal bureaucratic state by local patrimonialisms as an endemic feature in non-Western postcolonial state formation. The resultant neopatrimonial state is often blamed for the social, political, and economic ills plaguing these societies. This essay challenges conventional wisdom and argues that neopatrimonialism is a process of hybrid state formation that has its origins in the cultural politics of colonial state building. This is achieved by drawing on a comparative study of British Malaya and the American Philippines, which offers contrastive trajectories of colonialism and state formation in Southeast Asia. Because of the precariousness of state power due to local resistance and class conflicts, colonial state building involved the deepening of patron-client relations for political control and of rational-legal bureaucracy for social development. In the process, local political relations were marked and displaced as traditional patrimonialisms distinguished from the new modern center. Through native elite collaborators and paternal-populist discourses, new patron-client relations were institutionalized to connect the colonial state to the native periphery. However, colonial officials with different political beliefs and ethnographic world views in the center competed over native policy and generated cyclical crises between patron-clientelist excess and bureaucratic entrepreneurship. Instead of the prevailing view that postcolonial states are condemned to their colonial design, and that authoritarian rule favors economic development, my study shows that non-Western state formation is non-linear and follows a cyclical pattern between predation and developmentalism, the excesses of which could be moderated.

N2  - Are business associations a cure for or a cause of bad governance in Africa? Pluralists think business associations are needed to bargain and compromise over improvements in public policy, whereas public choice theorists suspect business associations of destructive rent-seeking. This article reports results of a survey in eight African countries that illuminates these issues. Most business leaders and civil servant respondents see major problems with governance, though across countries there is a perception of improvement. Business associations are reported to work reasonably well as policy advocates for better governance. They are seen as doing a fair job of keeping members updated on the policy environment. The associations also appear to be building `social capital' (the ability to trust and work cooperatively with others) among member firms. Thus, the evidence is that business associations in Africa conform better to the pluralist model of interest group behaviour, as opposed to the more critical public choice viewpoint.

N2  - This paper reviews a survey of 800 business leaders and civil servants in Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. Like most African countries, these eight countries have undertaken governance reforms over the past decade, trying to include a wider range of views expressed by organized interest groups in the formulation of economic and commercial policies. This survey aimed to learn how business and government leaders perceive those recent governance reforms. First, do managers and civil servants see local trade associations successfully representing the broader business point of view with decision makers, and keeping their members informed of current and proposed public policies? Second, to what extent do perceived principal/agent tensions divide companies from "their" business associations? Third, how does industry structure affect perceptions of business association performance? A fourth issue is whether perceptions exist of "bureaucratic capture" or of excessive state power over business associations in the sample countries. Most respondents see major problems with governance, though across countries they report the impression of improvement and expect further gains. This raises the risk of unmet expectations should the pace of reform slacken. Business associations are reported to work reasonably well as policy advocates for better governance. They are seen as doing a fair job of keeping members updated on the policy environment. There was little difference in opinion between larger and smaller companies, and surprising overlap between the public and private sectors. These findings are grounds for wary optimism about business-government relations in the region. Progress will not occur automatically, however. Companies in Africa need to redouble their government relations and policy advocacy activities. The region's industry and trade associations are promising vehicles for expressing the interests of the business community.

N2  - Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly utilized
and accepted by patients and providers throughout the American health
care system. Most accounts attribute this growing acceptability to the
shortcomings of conventional medicine, the appeal of CAM's core beliefs,
and the growing body of research indicating that CAM actually works.
These explanations, while all accurate to some degree, neglect the
extent to which CAM's recent success is due to economic and political
factors. This article describes the emerging relationship between CAM
and major economic actors (pharmaceutical firms, managed care companies,
insurance companies, media conglomerates, Internet providers, etc.) as
well as CAM's relationship with a range of political forces (political
parties, bureaucrats, lobbying groups, ethnic- and gender-based
movements and organizations, etc.). The convergence of interests between
these economic and political forces and many of CAM's goals is one
important reason for CAM's recent success.

N2  - This article analyzes the political-institutional determinants of bureaucracy quality among a group of newly industrialized countries in Latin America and East Asia democratized in the Third Wave. Four causal conditions are examined for the occurrence of higher levels of bureaucratic ``weberianess'' in the selected cases: historical sequence, political parties' institutionalization, electoral competition, and ethnic politics. The study employs the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to explore the expectation that each of these conditions' implications depends on other conditions' presence or absence. The findings disconfirm claims about the critical role of party system institutionalization for Weberian bureaucracies in new democracies. Besides, the analysis did not declare a professional public administration's prior existence before democratization as a necessary or sufficient condition for the outcome of interest. Finally, although the electoral competition was declared necessary for the outcome occurrence, it does not imply the same result if combined with ethnic politics.

N2  - The study aims to contribute to the discussion about the State in the 21st century by pointing to some critical features of public bureaucracy that deserve more empirical research to provide ,evidence to support proposals for administrative reform in developing countries. Applying multivariate analysis techniques to available datasets, it is verified whether the institutional characteristics of the Brazilian bureaucracy challenged by PEC 32/2020 - recruitment by competitive public examination, the professionalization of senior positions, the existence of a special work regime for civil servants, and the adoption of attractive salaries - are associated with international performance indicators of public administration. The findings corroborate the theoretical arguments that, in addition to attractive salaries and recruitment by competitive public examinations, a special work regime with career stability for civil servants has significant relationships with reduction of corruption and improvement of public governance in the group of developing countries. That is because the risks in these countries of patronage practices are greater when compared to developed countries with well-established bureaucracies.

N2  - In the development of the court building office in Munich it can be shown that the political ambitions of the Elector Max Emanuel of Bavaria are crucial for the organization of his building administration. The instructions to the officials, the creation of the Generalbaudirektorium and the appointment of the court architect Joseph Effner also show the special challenges and problems of building administration. These become particularly clear in the instructions from the year 1655. The history of the Generalbaudirektorium makes it clear that the interest of the Elector was not in the efficiency of administration, but in competition with other princely courts. The representative claim was to be demonstrated by an extensive palace landscape around Munich. The very rapid construction progress of the projects could only be accomplished thanks to the special skills of Joseph Effner. The administration, on the other hand, seems to have been more of a bureaucratic obstacle!.

it focuses on corporate boards
N2  - This article explores an important aspect of post-career earnings in public life in Britain: membership of corporate boards by former parliamentarians, ministers and civil servants. It attempts to determine whether this group represents a distinct group within the wider network of interlocking corporate directorships in the UK. Further, it investigates the characteristics of those individuals who obtain appointments as non-executive directors to the boards of FTSE-listed companies after service in parliament and/or government. The analysis uses data on board membership and pay in Britain for more than 700 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange and over 7,500 directors and 1,000 former parliamentarians, government ministers and civil servants. The findings suggest that although this group is represented in the wider corporate network, these individuals are not more central than other directors and do not receive significantly different compensations once industry sector, experience and board role are controlled for.

N2  - Introduction Under what conditions are territorial legislative designs decisive in shaping intergovernmental fiscal relations? As decentralization became more widespread in the developing world in the 1980s and 1990s, it ignited a great deal of scholarly attention on the economic viability of federalism. One of the most salient, mostly unchallenged, theses about this question traces the superiority of decentralization to normative economic thinking on federalism. Drawing on Charles Tiebout’s (1956) work, it is argued that decentralization limits the ability of government officials to supply local goods on political grounds. In this light, Barry Weingast (1995) developed the concept of market-preserving federalism to connote systems in which decentralized control over the economy by subnational governments within a common market precludes the central government from encroaching on the political and economic rights of its citizens. This arrangement, the argument goes, underpins fiscal responsibility, providing no incentives for the constituent parts to overuse the common pool of federal economic resources. In recent years, however, as the “desirability” of federalism has burst upon the scene as a subject of interest to scholars and policy-makers, Weingast’s assumptions have come under criticism (Rodden and Ackerman 1997). Perhaps the most important common thread running through these works is that normative public choice theories largely ignore the role of bureaucracy and the political framework in which intergovernmental decisions are taken. Put differently, Weingast’s theoretical roadmap fails to account for the poor fiscal performance of many federal states such as India and the large Latin American federal states of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, let alone the Russian experience which kindled a cacophony of epithets such as market-distorting federalism (Slider 1997) and market-hampering federalism (Zhuravskaya 2000). The major alternative approach to assessing the putative advantages of federalism through a political economy framework has been that of normative studies on the concept of representation. Early normative approaches, such as that to be found in the seminal works of Moffet (1895) and Merriam (1931), tended to view the institutional underpinnings of federalism as decisive in guaranteeing fair legislative decision-making in multi-tiered polities. Extolling the virtues of the US Great Compromise (i.e. the decision to grant each state equal representation in the Senate), this scholarship has emphasized that particular principles or structures of government are necessary conditions to be present in any federal system. Namely, every federation must have a second chamber in the legislature representing the regions and this chamber should be safeguarded against the potential hegemony of the larger subnational units in the federation. Advocates of this perspective praise equal representation in the second (i.e. upper, territorial) chamber as a check on the tyranny of the majority, drawing on the spirit of The Federalist Papers and suggesting that legislative overrepresentation reinforces pluralism (Elazar 1987: 102-104; Morley 1959). However, as Burgess (2006: 205) claims, overrepresentation in the territorial chamber is the exception rather than the rule in modern federations (excluding the highly overrepresented Senates in Argentina, Brazil and, to a much lesser extent, Australia), let alone that studies on US federalism cast doubt on the benefits of Senate overrepresentation in terms of low levels of party competition in many states, inequitable distribution of state transportation and education funds, and a failure to adopt or expand social welfare programs, among others (Lee and Oppenheimer 1999: 4). More critically, as I will seek to show in this chapter, most scholarship of a normative nature has failed to provide empirical grounds to support their advocacy of non-proportional legislative representation. The analytical challenge, then, is to develop a theory of comparative federal fiscal performance based on how the institutional structure of federalism provides incentives for political officials at all levels of government. Surprisingly, few scholars have focused on this central question in the study of comparative federalism. The first notable exception is the research undertaken by Wibbels (2005), showing that intergovernmental partisan harmony achieved via coattails is the most important factor to extend market reform to the subnational governments in the developing world. This situation arises when the national government can rely on copartisans at the regional level not as a result of centralized control or the use of sticks and carrots, but rather as the basis for intergovernmental coordination of policies. Another study addressing the subject matter even more directly is Braun et al.‘s (2002) analysis of the influence of federalism on fiscal policy making. They conclude that intergovernmental veto powers, namely whether the federal or subnational governments have the upper hand in the design of fiscal policies, are decisive to explain policy outputs such as budget deficits. Third, Rodden (2006)‘s study on the perils of fiscal federalism shows that subnational governments can spend well beyond their means because the structure of federalism shifts bailout decisions away from bank regulators and technocrats and turns national legislatures into king-makers when it comes to the control of subnational fiscal profligacy. Stressing the role of electoral externalities, Rodden claims that state politicians will only ponder about the national consequences of their fiscal policies when their electoral fate is tied to that of their federal-level counterparts. Persuasive as the above-mentioned works are, they fall short of theorizing institutional complexity in federal systems as a result of their omission of the theoretically unwieldy topic of legislative malapportionment. As suggested above, beyond the normative issue of whether this built-in overrepresentation in federal systems is necessary, an extensive empirical literature confirms that legislative malapportionment has not only a decisive effect on the coalition-building efforts of executives at the central and subnational level but also substantial and direct consequences on public policy (USA: Ansolabehere et al. 2002; Atlas et al. 1995; Argentina: Gibson and Calvo 2000; Germany: Pitlik et al. 2005; European Union: Rodden 2002a). The logic is simple: because overrepresented, sparsely populated, economically vulnerable jurisdictions can be co-opted in the legislate process at the least cost and hence offer more “political bang for the buck”, public spending and distributive politics will be biased in favor of said entities. While there is no shortage of empirical evidence to establish that malapportionment “matters”, this chapter argues that the major challenge is to develop, or refine existing, theoretical tools to map out the precise institutional incentives at play. Above all, if malapportionment is to have a causal effect on fiscal policies, it is of essence to unravel its dynamic relationship with its most proximate correlates, namely socio-demographic and economic conditions, electoral rules and party politics. How does malapportionment affect the regional disparities that politicize the federal budgetary process? By increasing the number of small, overrepresented jurisdictions, do malapportioned electoral rules induce federal partisan biases? These questions indicate how difficult it is to disentangle federalism from other institutional variables such as the electoral and party systems and the importance of analyzing federalism within the broader political system in which it is embedded. As a central parameter in the design of federal institutions, the biased apportionment of seats to national legislative bodies highlights the tension between the empowerment of subnational actors (and the concomitant enhancement of democratic accountability) and the accompanying possibilities for clientelistic and rent-seeking behavior. Put differently, the unintended consequence of compensating underpopulated, oftentimes poorer, jurisdictions for their disadvantaged position is their over-empowerment to tilt federal policies beyond social welfare criteria. Thus, I claim that a progressive, normativeladen, overrepresentation of small jurisdictions often results in regressive, social welfare-detrimental, pork barrel fiscal policies. Aside from this chapter’s contribution to the intergovernmental fiscal relations literature, I seek to engage in the broad theoretical debate in comparative politics about the role of institutions in shaping political and economic outcomes. Particularly, this research aims to underscore how federal institutions may at times undermine the normative purposes for which they were designed in the first place. The overrepresentation of the smallest units, which is the cornerstone of the US Great Compromise, not only empowers the legislators of these units to coalesce in demanding policy concessions at the expense of the populous states, but may also generate sub-optimal outcomes in terms of fair economic distribution and performance. Consequently, instead of taking federal institutions as given, I show that whether they help effective policy-making to accommodate territorially based political and economic differences is ultimately an empirical question. In this regard, one common theme throughout this chapter is that while institutions themselves become loci of political contestation, the power asymmetries documented in this study are not likely to disappear unless reforms of Senate apportionment take effect. Considering the multiplicity of entrenched interests hindering institutional reforms and thus in light of the apparent endurance of legislative overrepresentation, the failure to elaborate a systematic understanding of its effect

N2  - City governments in sub-Saharan Africa have historically been beholden to national governments. Lack of national urban policies and tensions between national and city governments are common. Yet, for decades, research has identified small-scale innovations at the urban scale. Rarely, however, are policy innovations in African cities so influential as to lead national governments to scale up city based actions. This is particularly true in sectors that have been the dominant purview of central governments. This paper examines how citizens, civil society organizations, city governments and national bureaucrats in two cities of East Africa - Kampala and Nairobi - have interacted to produce policy innovation in agriculture. Agriculture has always been a sector of high national importance in Africa, but increasingly cities are becoming focal points for agricultural policy change. The two cities compared in the paper are unusual in having a collection of interests who have been advocating for improved support and recognition of urban food production. Indeed, these cities are rare for having continually promoted the formalization of urban agriculture in local and national policy. While advocacy for urban agriculture is common globally, what is not clear is under what conditions local advocacy produces policy uptake and change. What are the conditions when city-based advocacy deepens the institutionalization of policy support locally and nationally? Drawing from theory and research on policy change and African urban politics and governance, and qualitative data collection in each country, this paper argues that while external, international assistance has helped initiate policy dialogue, domestic civil society organizations and their engagement with local and national bureaucrats are key to policy support at the local and national scales.

N2  - This paper examines the political embeddedness of public-sector primary care in urban India. The low quality of urban healthcare in many low- and middle-income countries is well documented. But there is relatively little analysis showing how the politics of urban healthcare delivery contribute to quality shortfalls. This study integrates urban and political theory and draws on ethnographic fieldwork in municipal government-run primary care clinics in Pune, India. I conceptualize Pune's municipal doctors as street-level bureaucrats: frontline state agents charged with delivering public services, who regularly confront conflicts between their mandate and its realization in practice. I observe how the municipal doctors experience and respond to these conflicts; delineate the historical design of the municipal institutions in which they operate; and interview doctors, nurses, nonclinical staff, administrators, and elected officials, who collectively shape primary care delivery in municipal clinics. My findings show how the doctors' work is characterized by routine departures from public service ideals. The departures stem from local electoral politics (politicians' patronage and clientelistic relations with municipal employees and patients) and weak administrative capacity (misuse and incompetent planning of public resources). The doctors are compelled to follow extra-policy directives, meaning instructions that have little to do with healthcare goals and that emphasize the political utility rather than medical purpose of their work. In response, the doctors circumscribe their clinical practice. They aim, as one doctor put it, only to “ensure the ordinary,” or to sustain a deficient status quo. In these conditions, improving quality of care requires not just behavioral interventions targeted at doctors. It requires normative, social, and organizational shifts in public service planning and delivery so that doctors are positioned – materially and affectively – to meet urban healthcare challenges in low-resource contexts.

N2  - Who provides the European Union with information? This article examines patterns of participation in the large expert group system under the European Commission. It explores competing propositions about the character of the Commission's information system, and tests four hypotheses about what affects participation in the EU expert group system. The authors distinguish between three kinds of information providers: scientists, societal actors and government officials. The empirical section of the paper builds upon an analysis of a data set covering all of the Commission expert groups (N = 1237). Although scientists, and interest groups, industries and NGOs are prevalent information providers for the Commission, the authors show that the informational foundation is strongly biased towards officials from national administrations. They argue that these distinct patterns of participation are significantly affected by inter-institutional and environmental conditions that the Commission Directorate Generals operate under. Access of experts increases the ability of the Commission to anticipate reactions to its proposals and initiatives and hence it impinges on the interinstitutional dynamic of the EU.

N2  - The article discusses the administrative-legal and phenomenological approaches to understanding the official loyalty. Official loyalty is being considered under the administrative-legal approach as adherence to formal official duty, which is a system of obligations, taken together with official status, the source of which are: normative base of service activity, legal requirements of the head and public interests. Lists of the limitations of administrative-legal approach to understanding the of official loyalty: weak underdeveloped concept, the failure to take into account the wide range of situations, operation with a models rather than actual processes. Discusses the advantages of the phenomenological approach in studying the performance of loyalty: its psychological advantages, the existence of a theoretical framework, the work with the real phenomena. Within the phenomenological approach official loyalty is defined as psychological-behavioral integration of the employee in the group operating in the service sector, on the basis of a common cause of activities. Possibilities of sharing of the considered approaches for the decision of problems of optimization of official activity are designated.

N2  - Britain's National Health Service (NHS) is a universal, single-payer health system in which the central state has been instrumental in ensuring equity. This article investigates why from the 1970s a policy to achieve equal access for equal need was implemented. Despite the founding principle that the NHS should "universalize the best," this was a controversial policy goal, implying substantial redistribution from London and the South and threatening established medical, political, and bureaucratic interests. Our conceptual approach draws on the advocacy coalition framework (ACF), which foregrounds the influence of research and ideas in the policy process. We first outline the spatial inequities that the NHS inherited, the work of the Resource Allocation Working Party (RAWP), and its new redistributive formula. We then introduce the ACF approach, analyzing the RAWP's prehistory and formation in advocacy coalition terms, focusing particularly on the rise of health economics. Our explanation emphasizes the consensual commitment to equity, which relegated conflict to more technical questions of application. The "buy-in" of midlevel bureaucrats was central to the RAWP's successful alignment of equity with allocative efficiency.We contrast this with the failure of advocacy for equity of health outcomes: here consensus over core beliefs and technical solutions proved elusive. © 2018 by Duke University Press.

N2  - This article considers the discussion and rejection of social insurance model of funding for the British National Health Service. Specifically it asks why the hospital contributory scheme movement had so little impact on policy debates in the 1940s. We argue that at the start of the policy-making process serious consideration was given to the incorporation of this mode of funding, not least because the contributory schemes, with some ten million members, played a major role in financing existing voluntary hospital provision. Early sections describe the growth and nature of the schemes, noting that, despite their large working-class constituency and the presence of labour movement representatives amongst their leadership, they remained peripheral to discussion of reform in the interwar period. We then trace the emergence of the proposal for an insurance-based 'hotel-charge' in civil servants' discussions about hospital funding the Beveridge Report. Officials, however, remained sceptical about the contributory schemes' capacity to deliver a comprehensive and efficient funding mechanism, given their lack of uniformity, the gaps in their coverage, and the limited progress of reciprocal arrangements between them. Finally, we note the ineffectiveness of the British Hospital Contributory Schemes Association as a player in the policy community. Its leadership had no clear strategy for influencing events and was reluctant to deploy pressure group tactics such as lobbying through the press or parliament. Crucially, the movement was divided internally between those members who supported the voluntary system and others who welcomed a publicly funded health service.

N2  - Transport is a significant and growing contributor to climate change. To stay within `safe' global warming guardrails requires substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. This represents a global political consensus, but there is evidence that current legislation in the transport sector is not significant enough to achieve medium- and longer-term reduction goals. In focusing on the European Union, this paper investigates the perspectives of twelve policy officers in three Directorates-General (MOVE, CLIMA, ENV) of the European Commission with regard to their understanding of mitigation goals and timelines, responsibilities for policy development and implementation, and perceived efficiencies of these policies to achieve climate objectives in the transport sector. Results indicate diverging and common views on climate policy goals and political responsibilities, as well as barriers to policy-making, including lack of political leadership on climate change mitigation, resistance from member states, the favoring of economic growth over cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, pressure from industry and lobby groups, preferential treatment of aero- and automobility over more sustainable transport modes, policy implementation delays, insufficient forecasting and monitoring tools, and an overreliance on technologies to contribute to emission reductions. In offering a view inside the `black box' of transport policy-making, the paper reveals fundamental institutional (structural) and individual (agency-based) barriers that will have to be overcome if significant emission cuts in the transport sector are to be achieved.

N2  - The rise of large-scale anti-corruption movements in India therefore reveals more than simply public dissatisfaction and vocal opposition to the rumour of apparently ever increasing corruption scandals. In the last three years, possibly even since the passage of India’s Right to Information Act of 2005, anti-corruption has had an unrivalled appeal across the political spectrum, and nearly everyone has wanted a piece of it. The Congress-led anti-corruption reports argued that the colonial bureaucracy therefore had mapped onto a range of traditional relationships that failed to embrace the ‘modern’ principles of governance being espoused by the ruling regime. The notion of corruption as a decline in political morality then, also appeals to parties who have sought to revive the moral impulses of ŉational’ unity. Anti-corruption movements and public discussion about corruption, for example, are naturally more common around times of electoral contest.

N2  - Objective: Breaches of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Te Tiriti) and evidence of institutional racism have been consistently documented within the public sector for decades. Chief executives across the sector have a critical responsibility to lead the implementation of the Crown's Te Tiriti o Waitangi responsibilities. This paper examines the recruitment and performance review processes of public sector chief executives from 2000 to 2020 to ascertain Te Tiriti compliance. Methods: Recruitment and performance review templates were obtained via official information requests to Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission. The data were analysed using a five-stage Critical Tiriti Analysis to determine compliance based on indicators developed around the five elements of Te Tiriti. Results: Our study found no explicit evidence of engagement with te Tiriti in any aspect of the recruitment and or performance review processes in the documents released. Conclusions: This appears to be another contemporary breach of Te Tiriti that urgently needs to be addressed prior to the new round of appointments in the health sector. Implications for public health: With significant senior appointments about to be made within the health sector, this paper is a timely contribution to the wider debate about the implications of the WAI 2575 Waitangi Tribunal report on the health sector.

N2  - In its Appointments Clause jurisprudence, the Supreme Court has
articulated a ``timely challenge{''} requirement for litigants
contesting the appointment of Officers of the United States. Most
recently, the Court recited this language in Lucia v. SEC, a case in the
October 2017 term, where it granted the petitioner a new hearing before
a Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Law Judge after
finding a violation of the Appointments Clause. However, the Court has
yet to provide a concrete definition for the phrase.
This Note seeks to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive framework
to assess the timeliness of these constitutional challenges. It begins
by tracing the doctrinal evolution from its origin in Ryder v. United
States to its present iteration. Coupled with Court's discretionary
approach to nonjuris-dictional constitutional issues raised in the first
instance on appeal, this Note argues that review by a constitutionally
valid officer is necessary to extinguish the timeliness of a challenge.
This reasoning draws upon the Court's treatment of the de facto officer
and de facto validity doctrines in the Appointments Clause context and
tests it in the context of a hypothetical SEC proceeding.

N2  - Work on the county community during the English Civil War, and tensions between centre and periphery, has focused exclusively upon forms of political and cultural representation. However, this article argues that local communities also sought to achieve agency within the wider war effort by lobbying for military representation. In return for financial contributions, supporters wanted an interest in the units they raised, mainly through control over the nomination of officers. The history of the army of the earl of Essex between June and December 1642 indicates the financial consequences of neglecting such military representation. Its structure dissolved particularist interests, orientating the army towards the pursuit of a national strategy, but this gave local supporters no confidence that their concerns were being represented. The result was an assertion of localism, a decline in donations, and a financial crisis within the army..

N2  - This paper provides a network analysis of federal lobbying in Canada by the fossil fuel industry and compares lobbying across the Harper Conservative and Trudeau Liberal administrations. The network we uncover amounts to a small world of intense interaction among relatively few lobbyists/firms and public officials in select centres of state power. Under Trudeau we find that the majority of lobbying is carried out by the same large firms as under Harper, while lobbying has become trained on fewer state agencies. We consider lobbying to be an important channel through which the fossil fuel sector shapes government policy.

N2  - This paper applies the property rights theory to study both positive and normative aspects of legislative delegation in a setup where interest groups directly influence lawmaking by initiating regulatory bargaining. A self-interested legislature choosing between the direct exercise of its legislative authority and delegation to an administrative agency must therefore trade off the value of bureaucratic competence against bureaucratic drift and, importantly, loss of control over bargaining. Our analysis, first, clarifies when the legislature's choice between delegation and no delegation is socially efficient or socially inefficient; second, highlights the role of political bargaining and shows that precluding interest group influence through bargaining may actually increase the scope for socially inefficient outcomes; and, third, illustrates the model's predictions in light of selected stylized facts and the practice of scant empirical work on legislative delegation.

N2  - Studies have shown how women are underrepresented in senior executive
positions in public and private organizations. Equal representation
matters both for reasons of performance and legitimacy, and, to
understand the mechanisms behind the glass ceiling, we explore if the
women making it to the top of the Danish civil service differ from the
men who do so. We want to understand if senior executive positions
require something different of women than men. Using a dataset
consisting of the entire career trajectory of all senior civil servants
in Denmark, we find that, on numerous human capital dimensions, the
women and men making it to the top are quite similar, for example, in
terms of tenure and educational level. However, we find on the one hand
that men are more often employed in the most prestigious departments
and, at the same time, it seems that men with a profile deviating from
the norm are more likely to make it to the top than women. This may
indicate that the most prestigious positions - also in terms of
early-career positions - are less accessible to women, and that women
are less willing to apply for jobs outside their usual domain, or that
those responsible for recruitment are less willing to take a chance on a
woman with a slightly unorthodox profile. Hence, our study indicates
that greater interest should be paid to the dynamics keeping women at
lower levels of the hierarchy and possibly to encourage them to apply
for top positions.

N2  - Barriers to entry in regulated markets are frequently conceptualized as static features that must be removed or overcome if new entrants are to successfully enter a market. But government institutions regulating markets often comprise multiple levels that exist in tension with one another due to differing incentives and motivations. We argue that the principal-agent tension between elected officials and agency bureaucrats may render regulatory barriers to entry more malleable, even in the absence of formal policy changes. To test this proposition, we bring the administrative state center stage and examine how regulatory discretion-regulatory agencies' flexibility to interpret and implement public policies created by elected officials-can influence the market entry of new ventures. Using data on regulatory approval of hydroelectric facilities in the United States from 1978 to 2014, we find that increased state agency discretion improves outcomes for new ventures relative to incumbent firms by freeing regulatory agency officials to interpret and implement policies according to a professional motivation of public service and reducing incumbents' political influence.

N2  - Background Clinical trials have shown cannabis to be effective in the treatment of some medical conditions and there is mounting public and political pressure to enact laws enabling the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. To date, 28 United States (U.S.) states and the District of Columbia have enacted medical cannabis laws. This study sought to identify the main issues pertaining to the development of medical cannabis laws in the U.S, including the role of scientific evidence. Methods Data were collected from three groups of participants: government officials, lobbyists and medical professionals involved in the medical cannabis debate in five selected states in the U.S.; researchers from the same five states conducting funded research in the alcohol and other drugs field; and members of the International Society for the Study of Drug Policy. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Six major themes emerged in relation to the factors influencing policy: scientific evidence plays a limited role in the development of policy; the available research is limited and mixed; there is a need for clearer communication and active dissemination of evidence to policy makers; researchers need to consider what research is likely to impact on policy; scientific evidence is not a major factor in policy development; and there is a need to consider evidence within a political context. Conclusion Researchers need to be aware of the political context in which medical cannabis laws are or are not enacted and consider ways in which research findings can achieve a higher profile within this context. © 2016

N2  - David Owen, who was appointed as Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary following the death of Anthony Crosland in February 1977, committed the Labour government of Jim Callaghan to a human rights-based foreign policy, stating in his first major speech that Britain would take a 'stand' on human rights violations in every corner of the globe. This ambitious agenda faced a major challenge when, in October 1977, Owen was alerted to the imminent shipment of British Ferret and Saladin armoured vehicles to the repressive Salvadoran regime of Carlos Humberto Romero. By uncovering the machinations that led to the eventual cancellation of the armoured vehicles contract in January 1978, this article explores how the Catholic Institute for International Relations (CIIR) spearheaded a powerful lobbying campaign, bringing the combined pressure of sympathetic journalists, parliamentarians, civil servants, and representatives of the Catholic Church within Britain to bear on the foreign policy establishment. This article therefore contributes towards a greater understanding of Britain's burgeoning human rights network, the connections it cultivated within Whitehall, and the processes through which it was able to effectively subvert traditional modes of foreign policymaking during a 'breakthrough' moment in human rights history.

N2  - Why have dominant parties persisted in power for decades in countries spread across the globe? Why did most eventually lose? Why Dominant Parties Lose develops a theory of single-party dominance, its durability, and its breakdown into fully competitive democracy. Greene shows that dominant parties turn public resources into patronage goods to bias electoral competition in their favor and virtually win elections before election day without resorting to electoral fraud or bone-crushing repression. Opposition parties fail not because of limited voter demand or institutional constraints but because their resource disadvantages force them to form as niche parties with appeals that are out of step with the average voter. When the political economy of dominance— a large state and a politically quiescent public bureaucracy—erodes, the partisan playing field becomes fairer and opposition parties can expand into catchall competitors that threaten the dominant party at the polls. Greene uses this argument to show why Mexico transformed from a dominant party authoritarian regime under PRI rule to a fully competitive democracy. He also shows that this argument can account for single-party dominance in other countries where the surrounding regime is authoritarian (Malaysia and Taiwan) and where it is democratic (Japan and Italy). The findings have implications for Mexico’s political future, the formation of new political parties, transitions to democracy, and the study of competitive authoritarianism. Kenneth F. Greene is Assistant Professor of Government at the University of Texas at Austin. His research on regimes, political parties, and voting behavior has been published in the American Journal of Political Science, Comparative Political Studies, PS: Political Science and Politics, Política y Gobierno, Foreign Affairs en Español, and edited volumes. He has served as Co-Principal Investigator on two National Science Foundation grants for elite and voter survey research in Mexico, won a Fulbright-García Robles fellowship, and held visiting positions at the Center for Democracy and Civil Society at Georgetown University and the Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame.

N2  - The ongoing debate over indigenous claims to intellectual and cultural property reveals a series of indigenous strategies of mobilization that both appropriate from and work against the logic of the market. Of particular significance in this regard are the various indigenous strategies used in contemporary pharmaceutical bioprospecting activities to address claims to traditional medical knowledge as cultural property. This article presents field data on a controversial ethnopharmaceutical project among the Aguaruna of Peru's high forest and offers a comparative analysis of the outcomes with attention to several other cases in and beyond South America. In particular, questions are raised about the forms of legitimating authority in the burgeoning international indigenous movement, the role of NGOs, researchers, bureaucracies, and corporations in this process, and the dilemmas that emerge from the politicization and privatization of indigenous culture and identity. © 2004 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

N2  - The European Court of Justice, and courts in general, were key actors in the creation of the European Union (EU). However, they cannot change major policy without political supporters to lobby and litigate for implementation. We argue that part of the resolution of this apparent paradox comes from complementing existing work on the activities of EU courts and litigants with a focus on a third actor: implementing bureaucracies, whose effect on law and politics has not been a focus of studies of EU legal development. Their calculations about whether to pay attention, lobby, and comply shape the impact of the law. Those calculations are variable and patterned; when and how bureaucracies listen to courts varies in predictable ways. We find evidence for this proposition in the case of EU health care services law, both in the secondary literature and in empirical studies of France and Spain.

N2  - Purpose: This paper aims to help executives understand how to interact with government in today’s chaotic political environment. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based upon voluminous research analyzing a unique data set downloaded from a number of sources, including the financial reports of public companies and the contribution reports filed by political action committees and candidates for Congress. Findings: This study found that political decision-making is constrained by a set of institutions the authors call the political landscape. This framework includes three factors that businesses looking to influence government and the elected officials themselves must consider: the politicians’ ideology, the political trends of their constituency and their existing relationships. While these factors constrain the ability of politicians and business advocates to successfully pursue certain policy positions, businesses may be able to influence these factors through effective political activism, and in so doing, they may be able to push key government decision-makers to alter their positions. Practical implications: This research will help executives understand how government operates in this new era of uncertainty. Being able to read the political landscape will enable business leaders to anticipate and perhaps even mitigate governmental threats to their business. Originality/value: This research updates the market theory of politics which has received limited empirical support. It is especially valuable in the wake of Supreme Court’s decisions that have increased the potential for business to impact politics.

N2  - Scholars of representative bureaucracy have long been interested in the linkage between passive representation in public agencies and the pursuit of specific policies designed to benefit minority groups. Research in this area suggests that the structural characteristics of those organizations, the external political environment, and the perceptions of individual bureaucrats each help to facilitate that relationship. Work to date has not, however, sufficiently investigated the impact of region on representation behavior, which is surprising given the emphasis that it receives in the broader literature on race and politics. Drawing on that literature, this study argues that, for black bureaucrats, region of residence is an important moderator of active representation because it helps to determine the salience of race as an issue and the degree of identification with racial group interests. It tests hypotheses related to that general argument in a nationally representative sample of more than 3,000 public schools. The results suggest that black teachers produce greater benefits for black students in the South, relative to other regions. A supplementary analysis also confirms the theoretical supposition that race is a more salient issue for Southern black bureaucrats, when compared with their non-Southern counterparts.

N2  - The local regulation of prostitution in Germany is a contested area of urban politics. In this issue area, morality claims intersect with the material interests of home- and landowners and the security demands of ‘ordinary’ citizens. The Prostitution Law of 2001 has liberalized the legal framework: the legislation ‘normalized’ sex work, triggering the re-definition of urban strategies to regulate prostitution. This article analyses the conflict dynamics and the framing of conflicts over regulations in four German cities. It identifies the main actors, coalition-building processes and the framing of conflicts, and links these elements to the resulting policies. With regard to theory, it explores the relevance of classical explanatory approaches to local governance such as party politics, urban growth coalitions, political culture and bureaucratic politics to the value-laden issue of prostitution. It thereby contributes to the growing academic interest in the nature of morality policies and the question of the specific conditions under which prostitution is framed as a moral issue or as a ‘normal’ subject within urban politics.

N2  - We theorize that direct social lobbying—the meeting of a lobbyist and public official outside of a formal office—persuades officials to support publicly policies favored by interest groups. Social lobbying influences public officials because the social environment allows for greater receptivity to interest group messages. A randomized field experiment was conducted by a lobbying firm in a US state legislature. Legislators randomly assigned to be socially lobbied more frequently expressed public support for the interest group’s preferred policy than did legislators lobbied in their offices or not contacted by the lobbyist. In addition, an original survey of registered lobbyists was conducted in 10 US states demonstrating that social lobbying regularly occurs. Political elites are influenced by the social environment; interest group direct lobbying is influential when conducted in places not easily observed by the public.

N2  - The European Commission initiative on collective redress was a failed attempt to introduce a form of class action in the European Union. Business organizations were firmly opposing the proposal, while citizen interest groups were mobilized to support it. The outcome was rather puzzling because some previous research suggests that business organizations in the European Union most often find themselves unsuccessful in defending the status quo, especially in the field of environmental and consumer protection. Business lobbying success in this case is explained by the low media salience of the issue and diverging preferences among public officials. The article illustrates how lobbying success in the European Union can also be achieved by maintaining the status quo and contributes to our understanding of contextual factors, most notably the role of policymakers.

N2  - At the conclusion of World War I a committee established by the United Kingdom Army Council was tasked with examining the ‘law and rules of procedure regulating Military Courts-Martial, both in peace and war, and to make recommendations’. In its 1919 report to Parliament, the committee began by noting the ‘enormous expansion of the Army during the European war’ and the ‘corresponding increase in the number of Courts-Martial’. Sadly, it also stated that the difficulties in dealing with the volume of legal work were exacerbated by the fact that ‘so many of the regular officers who were familiar with military law’ were lost in the first few months of the war. The need for reinforcements ‘rendered it impossible to devote much attention to the legal side of the training of new officers’. The committee was of the opinion that given the difficult circumstances, as a whole, the work of courts martial during the war was ‘well done’, although it made a number of recommendations for future improvements. Such recommendations included redrafting the Army’s disciplinary code to remove repetition and overlapping provisions and the appointment of trained legal advisers with experience in military discipline to assist in a number of matters, such as the work of courts martial and legal education. The committee commented on a range of matters, including the distinction between courts martial held on active service and in times of peace, the difficulties in ensuring justice while on operations, particularly where troops were in proximity to the enemy, and the rights of soldiers when charged with offences. In the (nearly) one hundred years since this report was written, the military justice system in the United Kingdom has been subject to a number of different reform efforts, not least due to the entry into force of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in 1953 and the adoption of the Human Rights Act 1998 (UK). Such reforms are not limited to the armed forces of the United Kingdom. As the chapters in this book demonstrate, military justice systems throughout the world, whether they are separate from the civilian justice system, as in the United Kingdom, or a part of that system, are in a state of transition.

N2  - Recently, the position of the Marshal's Guard and the legal status of the guards employed in this formation have changed significantly. Under the provisions of the Act of 26 January 2018, the Marshal's Guard gained the attribute of militarised service. On the basis of the solutions adopted by this regulation, the guards of the Marshal's Guard are no longer employees of state offices but officers performing their duties on the basis of a non-employment relationships. Despite the (seemingly) identical regulations, the legal status of the Chief of the Marshal's Guard has also changed on the basis of the 2018 Act. Currently, the Chief of the Marshal's Guard can be both an officer of this service and a person without such an attribute. The article attempts to characterise the legal status of the Chief of the Marshal's Guard, whose position in the state structure does not fit into the model solution used by other pragmatics. In the comparative context the service pragmatics of other militarised formations were also taken into account. Contrary to most regulations, the Chief of the Marshal's Guard is not a central body of government administration. Besides, the Act of 26 January 2018 on the Marshal's Guard is the only one that authorises the act of appointment to the post of head of the service not by the Prime Minister, but by the Head of the Chancellery of the Sejm. The publication attempts to establish the possible reasons for the introduction of such normative solutions. In particular, efforts were made to answer the question of whether these solutions are a consequence of the principle of the Sejm's autonomy. Finally, the employment status of the Chief of the Marshal's Guard is an issue that requires analysis and is discussed in the article. Taking into account the variety of forms of employment occurring in the militarised services, as well as the lack of precise statutory regulations in this field, the nature (employee or non-employee) of this employment relationship requires clarification.

N2  - The article examines how different appointment mechanisms, namely, office selling, impacted the performance of government officials in colonial Peru. Results show that entry by sales into the audiencia—a high-level institution with provincial oversight duties—worsened local governance in at least two ways: first, it led to a surge in the value of provincial positions, which capture the (illicit) returns from office. Second, it increased the likelihood of spontaneous rebellions against colonial authorities. These outcomes are likely driven by the type of official entering the audiencia—one less likely to rein in provincial officials due to the nature of their social and economic connections. The findings imply that the potential for profitable complementarities across layers of government can help us understand why and when office selling may lead to inefficient outcomes.

N2  - In 2017, Brazil's president faced impeachment proposals for allegedly receiving money from a businessman in exchange for influencing a decision of the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economica (Cade), the Brazilian competition authority. But, considering that Cade is an independent agency with a reputation for transparency, how may politicians influence antitrust enforcement? By analysing the responses given to a questionnaire of mine by anonymous former Cade commissioners, as well as other reports related to political influence on the agency and records from Congress, Cade, and other institutions, this article will examine the channels of political influence on Cade. First, I examine channels of democratic control, such as the appointment process. Secondly, by discussing those situations in which politicians approach the agency, I observe that, even in the absence of an explicit promise or threat, contact from politicians bears a special weight for Cade's officers. I argue that, regardless of conclusive evidence that political contact or pressure has actually impacted Cade's enforcement, public confidence in the agency might be harmed when there is the appearance that it has done so. Therefore, the appropriateness of increased transparency surrounding meetings between elected politicians and Cade's officers is a matter for consideration.

N2  - A key market institution is the degree of accountability to which the officials involved in regulation are exposed. While elected officials strive for re-election, appointed ones are career-concerned. Provided that the effort exerted to uncover the firm's unknown cost is sufficiently effective in swaying votes, elected officials produce more information than appointed ones do. As a result, when the demand is inelastic, appointment induces wider allocative distortions and higher profits which, in turn, yield stronger incentives to invest. Hence, appointment will prevail on election when investment inducement is sufficiently relevant and shareholders are sufficiently more powerful than consumers. Data on electricity rates and costs, and the methods of selecting regulators and appellate judges for a panel of forty-seven US states confirm these predictions.

Exclusion criteria: period and regimes (early modern empires)
N2  - Introduction Social science has also misled us on formal organization, having been taken in, perhaps, by what bureaucracy says about itself (and by Weber’s romance with the idea of bureaucracy) (Schneider, Schneider and Hansen 1977, 467). The time has come to look more critically at the view still prevalent in the social sciences that patronage is ‘a perverse and backward political practice, which prevails only where modern states fail’ (Introduction, 3). This limited view presumes a bureaucratic model of a ‘legal rational’ ideal-type, as prescribed by Max Weber. Interestingly, Weber himself saw the bureaucracies which emerged before World War I, and the business corporations which sprung up alongside, as the purest examples of this type (Constas 1958). Sociological research since Weber has shown the vast distance between formal and actual functioning of these institutions. After the economic crises of the 1970s, governments handed over large areas of economic life to the corporate sector. Other types of social provision, too, have been increasingly modified on what are seen as ‘market principles’, these mimetic efforts resulting in strange, parastate institutional hybrids like quasi-autonomous nongovernmental organisations.

N2  - Agency budgets are recognized as strong conditioning influences on executive nominations and, by extension, bureaucratic politicization. Key is an appointed position with greater budgetary authority attached being more important. Yet, position importance has been measured broadly—for example, distinguishing among appointment tiers—without incorporating discretionary budgets as a more nuanced measure. We rectify this, assessing hypotheses about how a position's discretionary budget impacts the president's nomination choice and the Senate's responses. As expected, higher budgets are associated with presidents nominating those with whom they are more in tune ideologically, but this effect is mitigated for top-tier appointments. Also as predicted, the Senate moves these high budget appointments through the process more smoothly with higher approval likelihoods. Budgets are a key element of position importance for department-level agencies, structuring how presidents choose and the Senate reacts in politicizing the bureaucracy.

N2  - Since the late twentieth century European and North American scholars have mainly focused on welfare state retrenchment or ‘restructuring’, especially since Paul Pierson’s Dismantling the Welfare State (1994). This book on reforms that were unpopular emphasized that welfare states were ‘immovable or resistant objects.’ Nevertheless, welfare states have actually changed drastically, whether through potential path-departing procedures and/or incremental change (Thelen, 2004; Streeck and Thelen, 2005). Jacob Hacker’s contribution to these debates focused on ‘policy drift’ (2004). He argued that the lack of actual reform given demographic evolution and economic restructuring should in fact be considered as a major form of change masked by apparent inertia. Other contributions have underlined other types of developments beyond the retrenchment/expansion dichotomy. These include transnational paradigmatic changes in what Jane Jenson has called ‘citizenship regimes’: who is in charge of welfare, the national, the local, the private sector, the individual (Jenson, 2008 and 2010)? Others focus on the redefinition of the welfare state as a guarantor against ‘new social risks’ (Bonoli, 2005) or as a ‘social investment state’ (Esping-Andersen et al., 2002). Many scholars have also highlighted shifts from general to targeted benefits, from public to private service delivery, from institutional care to cash benefits or fiscal subsidies, from passive to active social policies, from the welfare state to the ‘enabling state’ (Gilbert, 2004). Beyond the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) world, change is also occurring, drastic in Latin America, systemic in post-communist states, induced by the pressure of international financial institutions in developing countries, and unstable in states where the welfare state depends on the sharing of revenues from national resources or migrant remittances. Change itself, let alone its determinants and mechanisms in the field of social policy, is bound to be complex and analytically challenging. As Jochen Clasen and Nico A. Siegel put it: ‘Despite a growing availability and comparability of relevant data, the body of comparative welfare state research cannot be described as resting on a widely shared empirical basis or common understanding about how much change there is, what drives change, or how the nature of change should be understood or conceptualized’ (Clasen and Siegel, 2007, p. 4). To find our way, we first have to clarify what can be considered as change, depending of the level of change and the time-scale of the analysis (section one). Change can be defined as a process (e.g. policy drift) or an actual moment where change is visible (e.g. reform, social pact) and is independent of the mechanism of change (e.g. a horizontal policy transfer whereby country A mimics country B). Then we must distinguish the ‘why?’ question and the ‘how and who’ questions. Analytically, this means distinguishing variables such as demographic trends or macroeconomic policy trends that challenge existing welfare state arrangements from the policy process whereby actors’ constellations frame these trends and call for change exploiting proximate facilitating factors such as mobilizations or electoral policy windows (section two). In section three, we address the question of cross-national variation of these drivers of change and the role of transnational institutions, which also raises the question of hypothetical convergence. Change is a main challenge for social scientists. Concerning social policy and welfare state, three initial questions have to be clarified: what is the point of reference and the time-scale? What is the level of change taken in consideration? What are the factors of this change and the key protagonists of this story (ideas, institutions and actors)? From an historical-diachronic and long-term perspective, many current welfare state reforms could be viewed as marginal adaptations on the long run, when from a more synchronic, sociological or political point of view some of these reforms (and sometime the same ones) are presented as real or potential turning points. If the reference is ‘the great transformation’ observed by Karl Polanyi (1944), how can we consider the current reforms of the late twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first centuries? Another issue concerns the indicators of change. For example, even in the middle of the neoconservative storm of the 1980s and 1990s where the rhetoric against expanding public sector and social protection was at its peak, the welfare state still expanded revealing the gap between ideological clashes and concrete consequences. Since then, at the aggregate level and against many expectations, expenditure on social protection has remained stable (see Table 28.1). The level of change is therefore not necessarily proportional to the intensity of the controversies or rhetoric battles. Easily understandable as well, the fact that our diagnosis on the welfare state depends strongly of the current and ideological context. For instance, during the 1970s many social scientists following the theory of ‘social control’ were critical about the extension and controlling role of the welfare state. Thirty years later, others and sometimes the same scholars are much more cautious and, given the drastic consequences of current reforms, seem to defend the welfare state foundations against violent neoconservative attacks. This analytical reversal does not mean that social sciences are not objective enough, or that social scientists are just unpredictable, but that our categories to think changes also have to change when society as a whole has been deeply transformed over time (Castel and Martin, 2012). A similar phenomenon is at stake when important social scientists like Pierson or Esping- Andersen were diagnosing the inertia of contemporary welfare regimes in the middle of the 1990s, while other academics argue after a decade that even the so-called ‘frozen’ welfare states are going through substantial, institutional and perhaps paradigmatic changes (Palier and Martin, 2008; Palier, 2010). One must understand that both interpretations are not contradictory but complementary. They just take pictures at different moments of the process of change. Retrospective and comparative analysis of the welfare state reforms raises the question of the importance or the level of change (Hall, 1993). Many factors must be considered: the time period, the selected indicators, and the specific programs under study. For some sectors of social protection like pension schemes, for example, the evaluation of change needs an extended time-lag as the current reforms may have a dramatic impact many years down the road. But the issue is: are these changes ‘minor’ or ‘substantial’, marginal or paradigmatic? Are they mere adjustments, adaptations or revolutions? Did they result from the traditional process of policy learning, characterized by the adjustment of policy measures and/or instruments and/or institutions according to their capacity to reach a given objective, or did the main goal of the policy change itself? Are we facing small cumulative changes in a ‘muddling through’ process? In other words, are these reforms accumulating over time, as the incremental layering of new provisions and instruments which can lead to subtle policy changes or major turns depending of this accumulation and its final direction? Thus, as Hinrichs and Kangas suggest, the important question is: ‘when is a change big enough to be labelled as a system shift?’ (2003). According to Peter Hall, these different levels of change involve different levels of analysis. ‘Paradigmatic change’ suggests ideational transfers and shifts. Changes in policy instruments prompt to pay attention to institutional pathways and interest groups as well as the means to achieve change (e.g. incentive structures). Changes in policy settings get us closer to bureaucratic actors, implementation and policy learning. Another question to investigate concerns the respective roles of political actors, interest groups, and high civil servants. © 2013 Bent Greve. All rights reserved.

Exclusion criteria: level (local - district)
N2  - Numerous countries have established local elected governments to improve public goods delivery and reduce information asymmetry between the state and citizens. These governments remain dependent on upper levels for funding which has been found to be influenced by patronage politics and partisan alignment. In this paper, we show that the networks of locally elected officials and bureaucrats determine the allocation of discretionary funds and resources to local governments. Villages whose elected heads reported stronger connections with local bureaucrats were more likely to win a one-time inter-village competition for funds organized by the district administration of Palwal - a district in the North Indian state of Haryana. Locally elected officials in the district also report that bureaucratic connections are at least as necessary as political ties with higher-level politicians to obtain funds for their villages. This centrality of bureaucratic connections can be partly attributed to the institutional design in India.

N2  - Background: Structural factors are known to affect individual risk and vulnerability to HIV. In the context of an HIV prevention programme for over 60,000 female sex workers (FSWs) in south India, we developed structural interventions involving policy makers, secondary stakeholders (police, government officials, lawyers, media) and primary stakeholders (FSWs themselves). The purpose of the interventions was to address context-specific factors (social inequity, violence and harassment, and stigma and discrimination) contributing to HIV vulnerability. We advocated with government authorities for HIV/AIDS as an economic, social and developmental issue, and solicited political leadership to embed HIV/AIDS issues throughout governmental programmes. We mobilised FSWs and appraised them of their legal rights, and worked with FSWs and people with HIV/AIDS to implement sensitization and awareness training for more than 175 government officials, 13,500 police and 950 journalists. Methods: Standardised, routine programme monitoring indicators on service provision, service uptake, and community activities were collected monthly from 18 districts in Karnataka between 2007 and 2009. Daily tracking of news articles concerning HIV/AIDS and FSWs was undertaken manually in selected districts between 2005 and 2008. Results: The HIV prevention programme is now operating at scale, with over 60,000 FSWs regularly contacted by peer educators, and over 17,000 FSWs accessing project services for sexually transmitted infections monthly. FSW membership in community-based organisations has increased from 8,000 to 37,000, and over 46,000 FSWs have now been referred for government-sponsored social entitlements. FSWs were supported to redress > 90% of the 4,600 reported incidents of violence and harassment reported between 2007-2009, and monitoring of news stories has shown a 50% increase in the number of positive media reports on HIV/AIDS and FSWs. Conclusions: Stigma, discrimination, violence, harassment and social equity issues are critical concerns of FSWs. This report demonstrates that it is possible to address these broader structural factors as part of large-scale HIV prevention programming. Although assessing the impact of the various components of a structural intervention on reducing HIV vulnerability is difficult, addressing the broader structural factors contributing to FSW vulnerability is critical to enable these vulnerable women to become sufficiently empowered to adopt the safer sexual behaviours which are required to respond effectively to the HIV epidemic.

N2  - The present study analyzed the role of Turkey's think tanks as NGOs and conducted a case study on the Foundation for Political, Economic, and Social Research (SETA), an organization that appears to dominate Turkish think thanks' sphere of activity. Based on the general classifications accepted in the literature on think tanks, the study found that SETA is a "political party affiliation" and "advocacy" think tank. Since its establishment, SETA has been ideologically aligned with the Justice and Development Party (AK Party). It acts as a partner in the design of AK Party policies, provides human resources to the AK Party bureaucracy, and conducts public diplomacy to legitimize these policies in the public eye. According to the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program's (TTCSP) data for 2019, 48 think tanks exist in Turkey. The fact that SETA stands out so significantly from its peers suggests that pluralism has been lost in this field and that a monopolization policy is preferred. This study concluded that if a country's NGOs are weak, this will lead to a democratic deficit. Utilizing Carl Schmitt's theory of "the total state," the study analyzed the way in which the post-2016 state-of-emergency regime and the new political regime that emerged following Turkey's constitutional amendments in 2017 have narrowed the sphere of influence of think tanks and NGOs in Turkey.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a background to the special issue on welfare schemes in India. After 25 years of decentralization of governance and structural adjustments implemented in the 1980s and 1990s, have welfare schemes implementation and execution become more accountable and efficient? This paper seeks a critical look at the welfare schemes and its relationship with decentralization and stakeholders' dynamics. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a review of studies post 1990s. Papers representing all main stakeholders are reviewed, namely, politicians and political parties, bureaucrats, beneficiary, and civil society organizations. The inclusion/exclusion decision for the papers was taken on two criteria: the paper/document had to explicitly investigate decentralization, and had to include welfare scheme as the overall theme under which decentralization was investigated. Findings: The paper summarizes the new complexities in the system. Stakeholder behaviour is driven by several factors external to the traditional social and economic diversities that signify the Indian sub continent. For example, the authors see the lobbying process shifting to the local level, increasing importance of the local politician and the significance of forming local coalitions and partnerships for better resource allocation. Originality/value: The paper attempts to provide an overview by going beyond a critique of development to focus on the perils of operating within a socio-economically complex society. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

N2  - THE INDIAN SUPREME COURT IS WELL KNOWN FOR ITS rather robust judicial activism. This past year, the Court banned state-sponsored private militia, thereby challenging the official counterinsurgency policy, annulled the appointment of the key official charged with pursuing corruption (the Chief Vigilance Commissioner), banned suspect mining in a mineral-rich state in India, and constituted a special body to investigate the alleged ill-gotten wealth of prominent citizens deposited in European banks. More recently, this Court upheld the validity of a law that set aside 25 percent of seats in private schools for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is indicative of the self-confidence of the Court in the legitimacy it enjoys, and also reflects the consistent growth in stature of this institution since independence in 1947 from the British colonial power. Perhaps one of the critical ingredients of enduring democratic constitutionalism in India has been the role of its highest court and the extraordinary legitimacy that it has come to enjoy. The Court crafted the doctrine of a “basic structure” of the Constitution in the late 1970s, to protect the essence of the constitution that a marauding prime minister was not allowed to amend. This was a battle that threatened the constitutionally designed separation of powers paradigm. More recently, the Supreme Court oversaw the supervision of the distribution of food to disadvantaged citizens. India's highest court has taken upon itself an extraordinary role. However, as has been pointed out elsewhere, courts cannot “supplant either political activism or the legislative process.” Sandra Fredman says that the democratic role for the courts entails enhancing accountability, facilitating deliberative democracy, and promoting equality. A fourth marker must be added to this list: facilitating access to justice irrespective of social or economic status. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

N2  - In this article, the authors seek to address the singular forms of the
State in the French overseas territories. It explores the original
historical construction and strengthening of both State interventions
and bureaucratic domination in these territories. While drawing up an
overview of the existing scholarship, the authors seek to look at the
colonial legacies while paying attention to both the variety of the
decolonization processes and their complex temporalities in the overseas
territories. Instead of naturalizing the so-called ``specificity{''} of
political interventions and the State in these territories, they look at
the various forms of mobilizations that contribute to frame them as
``singular{''} or ``exceptional{''}. The authors also argue that the
evolution of such framing is closely related to processes of
politicization and depoliticization. Finally, building on the street
-level bureaucracy scholarship, they look at the practical dimensions of
state action and administrative encounters.

N2  - The aim of this article is to determine the resource potential and the importance of the new forms of organization that are LAGs in rural development on the example of the Lublin region. The paper presents the characteristics of the resource potential of the LAGs, the evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of the LAG perspective 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 and the analysis of the objectives of LAGs in terms of their impact on the processes of local and regional development on the basis of the statutes and LDSs for 2014-2020. The study used the following methods: a diagnostic survey, a document analysis, desk research. The interview was conducted in the third quarter of 2016. The study verified two hypotheses: 1) LAGs are organizations with growing resource potential and the scope of impact on the development processes of the region, especially in the area of stimulating the integration process of sectors (cross-linking); 2) bureaucracy is still the main barrier to the functioning and implementing the strategic / statutory objectives of LAGs. The assessment of the operation of LAGs in the perspective of 2014-2020, as compared to 2007-2013, indicates their growing role in influencing the processes of local and regional development. This role is reflected in the growth of the resource potential of the organisations and the high effectiveness of LAGs. LAGs insufficiently focus on creating various network links. Bureaucracy is still the main barrier to the effectiveness of achieving the objectives. In the current term, the LDS objectives seem to be the objectives common to all interest groups that constitute these organizations. The objectives formulated in LDSs enable the accomplishment of all of the assumed principles of the LEADER approach.

N2  - With problems of congestion and pollution in urban areas perhaps greater work is needed in terms of both infrastructure and policy alignment when it comes to urban non-motorised transport (NMT). The objective of reviewing transport planning and policy mechanisms that prevailed during 1996 and 2006 is to assess whether existing planning and policy mechanisms; (1) allow for the integration of NMT into the transport system and into infrastructure and land use planning; (2) the mechanisms facilitate the evaluation of policy to improve NMT; (3) allow for the development of road design and maintenance standards that recognise NMT as a traffic component and thereby allowing for the reduction of pedestrian and cyclist fatalities. Literature and international experience suggests that for NMT it is non-government organisations that influence government and lobby for changes in policy, It is also found that once a policy is in place it is the local "street-level bureaucrats" who shape the policy and the in South Africa such a national policy and/or master plan has been lacking. This analysis finds that the planning mechanisms have not always been in place during the period under review. Once they were in place, however, these mechanisms have allowed for revision and non-government influence in order to adequately recognise NMT The challenge then became one of advocacy as has not been sufficient national and street level policy advocacy for NMT Prevailing planning mechanisms are therefore not yet making NMT an imperative. With the challenge of policy advocacy for NMT, it is important to briefly compare policy advocacy theory with the prevailing urban NMT arena. The production of planning documents (the Provincial Land Strategic Frameworks and the municipal Integrated Transport Plans ITPs) has failed to produce enough provincial strategies. Only two provincial NMT Plans exist to date; in the Western Cape and Kwazulu-Natal. During the review period there was no National NMT policy or provincial master plan, only a national NMT project. Between 1996 and 2006 there was no provincially driven urban NMT project.

N2  - The 1992 constitution of Ghana gives the Executive President of Ghana enormous and extensive powers of appointment. This over the years has led to the manifestations of the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) politics. As a result, Executive Presidents of Ghana have exercised their powers of appointment to the benefit of only party apparatchiks and loyalists without recourse to appointment based on apolitical or non-partisan meritocracy. In this regard, many Ghanaians, irrespective of their competence, experience and expertise, are denied the opportunity to serve their country simply because they do not belong to the ruling party. We argue that, the 1992 constitution of Ghana gives the Executive President so much power in appointing state officials, which promotes WTA politics and deepens clientelism. The paper reviews the extensive powers of appointment of the President and practically examines how the exercise of these powers promotes WTA politics and clientelism. It discusses previous attempts at promoting inclusive government through appointments and the challenges encountered. The paper finally proffers policy recommendations on how the powers of appointment could be exercised in a manner that promotes inclusivity and, to some extent, meritocracy.

N2  - Why does a state change its foreign policy objectives and who is responsible for instigating such change? According to Hermann, four primary change agents are central to this process: leaders, bureaucracies, changes in domestic constituencies, and external shocks. This paper argues that the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) is a complementary policy process framework that can explain foreign policy change (FPC) and that accounts for all four of these primary change agents. Additionally, it is a broader framework of the policy process that facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing FPC than traditional FPC research. The ACF has the potential to broaden our understanding of FPC by emphasizing the intersection of the international system with domestic politics and focusing on a myriad of policy actors coordinating their advocacy efforts to influence FPC. To support this argument, the paper discusses how FPC can benefit from the ACF and reviews past applications. It proposes a research agenda using the ACF to study FPC and draws conclusions about future challenges and directions.

N2  - Intense competition in the regional head election (Pilkada) has implications for the increasing costs that candidates have to prepare to win the competition. The high cost in the regional head election makes many regional heads, when elected, commit political corruption and practices that are more adapted to the situation, namely the new styles of clientelism. This study aims to determine the shift in the relationship between political corruption and clientelism and to see new forms of clientelism. The approach used in this research was a literature study. Documents were selected using an application from the Publish or Perish database. The results of this study indicate that first, the power of money in politics in Indonesia creates a significant dependence on economic power, which influences a high level of political corruption. Second, there are two new styles of clientelism, including buying and selling votes and patronage in the bureaucracy. This paper concludes that the various modes of political corruption and new styles of clientelism that occur underline political vulnerabilities at the local level due to the broad elaboration of regional authority discretion.

N2  - Why did comprehensive health care reform pass in 2010? Why did it take the form it dida form that, while undeniably ambitious, was also more limited than many advocates wanted, than health policy precedents set abroad, and than the scale of the problems it tackled? And why was this legislation, despite its limits, the subject of such vigorous and sometimes vicious attacks? These are the questions I tackle in this essay, drawing not just on recent scholarship on American politics but also on the somewhat-improbable experience that I had as an active participant in this fierce and polarized debate. My conclusions have implications not only for how political scientists should understand what happened in 2009-10, but also for how they should understand American politics. In particular, the central puzzles raised by the health reform debate suggest why students of American politics should give public policywhat government does to shape people's livesa more central place within their investigations. Political scientists often characterize politics as a game among undifferentiated competitors, played out largely through campaigns and elections, with policy treated mostly as an afterthoughtat best, as a means of testing theories of electoral influence and legislative politics. The health care debate makes transparent the weaknesses of this approach. On a range of key matters at the core of the disciplinethe role and influence of interest groups; the nature of partisan policy competition; the sources of elite polarization; the relationship between voters, activists, and elected officials; and morethe substance of public policy makes a big difference. Focusing on what government actually does has normative benefits, serving as a useful corrective to the tendency of political science to veer into discussions of matters deemed trivial by most of the world outside the academy. But more important, it has major analytical payoffsand not merely for our understanding of the great health care debate of 2009-10.

We first present an overview of lobbying during U.S. regulatory policymaking, including during OIRA’s review of proposed government regulations. Second, we introduce readers to a data source that allows scholars to track lobbying during OIRA’s regulatory review, and we provide several descriptive statistics from a lobbying dataset that covers January 2005 to June 2011. Third, we highlight different applications of these data, including our efforts to integrate the data with other information sources. We close by encouraging interest groups scholars to take advantage of these largely untapped data, which are more accessible today than even a few years ago and to connect these data with other available sources both inside and outside of the regulatory process.

N2  - Contemporary nation-states increasingly exercise their rights as sovereign nations to determine who crosses their borders. In recent years, the United States and Mexico have embraced this right by taking unprecedented steps to restrict the entry of unauthorized migrants by beefing up police activities along the border, strategies that have dire human consequences for journeying migrants. The U.S. campaign, which is officially known as "Prevention through Deterrence" was initiated in the early 1990s, in response to the failure of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 to curtail undocumented migration. Under the Prevention through Deterrence campaign, resources devoted to the border increased dramatically as agents and new technology were funneled to the area at the cost of roughly $2 billion a year. Much of the new technology and manpower is concentrated along historical urban crossing areas, such as San Diego, El Paso, and Brownsville.1 The new campaign prevents migrants from crossing in these well- established corridors and deters them to more remote rural areas where they are exposed to greater dangers and risk of death. The mortality bill resulting from these strategies is staggering. Since 1992-the year the campaign was initiated- more than three thousand migrants have died trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, which translates into at least one migrant death per day. The Mexican government launched its campaign, "Plan Sur," in 2001 to curtail Central Ameijican migration into southern Mexico. Hoping to gain amnesty for Mexican residents in the United States and under pressure from Bush to extend the U.S.-Mexico border farther south, the Mexican government deployed troops to the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca to conduct border patrols and install checkpoints along well-established crossing corridors.3 The strategy and subsequent human consequences mirrors events on the U.S.-Mexico border, which is not surprising given that the Mexican campaign is largely based on the Prevention through Deterrence model. To avoid the checkpoints in southern Mexico, which are located near towns and villages, Central American migrants take more risky routes in remote areas, where they fall prey to violent gangs, the most notorious of which is the Mara Salvatrucha.4 Migrants crossing into Mexico face rape, murder, robbery, injury from train wheels, shakedowns from government officials, and abandonment in the forests. When I interviewed Father Flor Maria Rigoni, a young Scalabrini priest and director of a migrant shelter in Tapachula, Mexico, he described Chiapas-the southern state of Mexico-as a "cemetery without a cross." In 2000,120 migrants died at or near the 600-mile Guatemalan-Mexico border. By 2001, less than a year later, this number had almost tripled to 355. The most recent figures indicate another increase: in 2003, Mexican authorities reported 371 migrant crossing deaths near the 6oo-mile-long Mexican-Guatemalan border. These governmental policies have come under increased scrutiny and criticism by Catholic and Protestant churches, religious leaders, and interfaith coalitions throughout Central America, Mexico, and U.S. border areas. Recog-nizing that contemporary Latin American immigration to the United States is part of a larger phenomenon associated with the globalization of labor, religious leaders and interfaith coalitions throughout the region increasingly convey the message that the current U.S. immigration system is broken and in need of reform. The consequences of the current system, religious leaders argue, are morally unacceptable-the exploitation of migrant labor and the abuse and death of migrants who seek to enter. These conditions-they argue-threaten the basic human dignity and rights of the migrant. Thus, although both Protestant and Catholic churches recognize that sovereign nations have the right to control its borders, they do not condone such a right when it violates the human rights and human dignity of a migrant, regardless of legal status. Thus, increasingly the church calls for policies that do not abuse or exploit migrants, place them in danger, violate their due process, or detain them indefinitely. To protect the migrants from violation of their rights, religious leaders propose that churches become more involved in creating a just and humane border environment, including providing humanitarian services for journeying migrants. Triggered in part by the U.S. Sanctuary movement of the 1980s-a religious- based movement that provided Sanctuary to growing numbers of Central Americans fleeing political turmoil in their homelands-and later fueled by recent large-scale immigration of poor Latin Americans to the United States in the context of the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border, a growing body of literature has developed that focuses on how Protestant and Catholic churches, religious organizations, and communities mobilize around the rights of migrants, especially at their arrival in the United States.6 I would like to extend the discussion to include Mexico and Central America and shift the focus from advocacy of migrant rights per se to the ways in which religious leaders, groups, coalitions, and institutions at local, national, and international levels are responding, both privately and publicly, to the everyday needs of undocumented migrants in transit. Of concern is how religious leaders in communities of origin and in transit countries serve the religious, spiritual, psychological, and practical needs of undocumented migrants as they prepare to leave their home communities and on their journey north. This is a primary battlefield on which the rights of migrants are played out but one that the literature on migration and social justice rarely addresses. The discussion takes place in the context of more restrictive state policies, which run counter to the official or unofficial positions of the church. Copyright © 2007 by Rutgers.

N2  - Background: The financing function within a health system is considered inherently complex, so it is of utmost importance to design a suitable future for this system given uncertainties and complexities of the environment. With regard to the current and future complicated conditions, health system financing is also likely to succeed if it can anticipate the impacts of effective factors in the future and further plan appropriate interventions ahead of time. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop scenarios for the health system financing in Iran. Methods: This mixed-design research of exploratory future studies type was conducted using the scenario method. In this respect, the key variables were evaluated using a questionnaire from two aspects of importance and uncertainty as well as formation of a future studies group (focus group). Finally, sensitivity analysis was carried out through cross-impact balance (CIB) analysis using the Scenario Wizard (Version 4.31) software. Results: A total of 25 factors were selected based on the type and the position of the variables (driving force, bi-dimensional, risk, secondary leverage or modifiable-to-secondary leverage) over the diameter of the MICMAC chart. Considering the degree of significance and uncertainty, eight variables including all four driving force variables (oil sales and economic blockade, leadership and advocacy, bureaucracy and corruption, and possibility of using information technology in providing services), as well as the variables of resource sustainability, natural disasters, regional security, and specialization culture were chosen. Then, five variables were finalized as the key changes that would create the scenario based on sensitivity analysis and final expert opinions. According to the defined conditions, 270 scenarios were developed, of which fourteen scenarios were identified as poorly adaptable and five cases as highly adaptable. Conclusion: The best scenario identified in this study based on the degree of adaptation included the use of massive technology and oil sales, mediocre economic conditions with high probability of occurrence, strong leadership and advocacy, high regional security, as well as bureaucracy and low corruption with medium probability of occurrence.

received responses from slightly fewer than one hundred councillors in
New Zealand local government out of 247 and therefore, the results
presented here should be viewed as indicative only because of the small
sample. Nevertheless the survey found that 54 per cent to 77 per cent
would prefer to have influence over council officer employment, with
council officers displaying deference to the authority of councillors.
Councillors prefer to have frank and fearless advice but they prefer not
to be under pressure from council officers to accept that advice. This
ensures that they obtain the type of support they need to carry out the
tasks and responsibilities that have been conferred on local
authorities; and they - the councillors rather than council officers
remain in control of the council affairs.

N2  - In this article, I present an exchange theory of interest group activity that specifies the incentives and constraints on interest group activity to explain the degree to which some interest groups try to influence bureaucratic activity on hate crime, the types of tactics groups use, and to assess their influence on police procedures. I test several related propositions from this theory using original survey and demographic data from a sample of anti-violence groups in the 250 largest American cities. The results of my analysis suggest that interest group attempts to influence bureaucratic action on hate crime are constrained by the group characteristics, their sources and use of financial resources, and the characteristics of the communities in which they operate.

N2  - This book focuses on one critical challenge: climate change. Climate change is predicted to lead to an increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters. An increase in extreme weather events, global temperatures and higher sea levels may lead to displacement and migration, and will affect many dimensions of the economy and society. Although scholars are examining the complexity and fragmentation of the climate change regime, they have not examined how our existing international development, migration and humanitarian organizations are dealing with climate change. Focusing on three institutions: the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations Development Programme, the book asks: how have these inter-governmental organizations responded to climate change? And are they moving beyond their original mandates, given none were established with a mandate for climate change? It traces their responses to climate change in their rhetoric, policy, structure, operations and overall mandate change. Hall argues that international bureaucrats can play an important role in mandate expansion, often deciding whether and how to expand into a new issue-area and then lobbying states to endorse this expansion. They make changes in rhetoric, policy, structure and operations on the ground, and therefore forge, frame and internalize new issue-linkages. This book helps us to understand how institutions established in the 20th century are adapting to a 21st century world. It will be of great interest to scholars and students of International Relations, Development Studies, Environmental Politics, International Organizations and Global Governance, as well as international officials.

N2  - A rich theoretical literature has illuminated the institutional mechanisms through which legislators influence agency policy. We focus on the behavioral ones, examining the decisions of individual legislators to intervene in agency rulemaking. We argue that interest groups play an important but incompletely understood role in the oversight process. They may sound alarms when agencies threaten harm, but they also subsidize the interventions of sympathetic overseers postalarm. We test the theory's hypotheses with data from face-to-face surveys of lobbyists involved in an EPA rulemaking to revise air quality standards. We find that public and private interest groups successfully employ this strategy but that the latter have the advantage, an advantage that does not flow from their substantial contributions to congressional campaigns.

N2  - Are all issues subject to the same attention from organized interests? If not, why not? This article utilizes data on organized interest mobilization in Scottish public policy to examine the pattern of engagement by policy participants across a large number of policy issues. It finds a heavily skewed pattern of mobilization: Most issues attract little attention, while a few issues account for the majority of attention (they are ``bandwagons{''}). This resembles the findings of Baumgartner and Leech, based on U.S. lobby data. Replication outside the United States supports the claim that this is a general pattern in public policy systems. But what explains such a pattern? After scrutinizing the ``size and scope{''} approach, this article proposes that positive feedback mechanisms are catalyzing cascades of mobilization. Several agents are identified as facilitating cascades in the data: keystone groups, the media, civil servants, and campaign groups.

These interest groups include environmentalists, citizen activists, the timber and mining industries, range users, tribal representatives, and recreationists, Gender, race, and career path are demonstrated to be significant factors related to NFS employee beliefs about a number of these interest groups. These results suggest that NFS employee diversification policies may have introduced into the workforce a set of employees who are less positive in their expectations of the timber industry, but more positive about environmentalists and some other key interest groups. This shift is predicted to aid the NFS in working more successfully with a wider diversity of external constituencies than in the past.

N2  - A series of court cases banned patronage except for leadership and confidential positions. In Cook County and Chicago, the Shakman Decree required the establishment of an antipatronage staffing system to ensure that political considerations did not enter into staffing decisions. Despite the court prohibitions and the antipatronage staffing systems, patronage continued to flourish. A number of unethical and illegal violations included falsifying exam scores and interviews, demanding political contributions for jobs and contracts, and covering up wrongdoing. These patronage abuses led to successful criminal prosecution of a number of individuals. Political influence had a corrupting effect on the government bureaucracy. At a time when many public personnel systems are moving toward at-will employment systems to provide flexibility and responsiveness to the political leaders, this direction might not be in the public's best interest.

N2  - “Since Beccaria, Sonnenfels and other worthy and popular authors have declared war on the death penalty and torture, everyone now wants to be an ‘enlightened thinker,’ and a horde of writers has formed itself behind them.” – Christian Gottlob Gmelin (1785) INTRODUCTION: On July 28, 1978, the French National Assembly passed Loi 78–888. The law changed several articles of the French Code of Penal Procedure governing the selection of juries in the <italic>cour d'assise (the tribunal that tries the most serious felonies). Before the law was passed, members of each jury were selected from a list assembled by local commissions. This method had been criticized as elitist, because the commissions tended to favor “respectable” citizens. The new law specified that jury lists would henceforth be composed by random, public selection of names from the voting rolls. The new law alarmed Robert Badinter, the French lawyer and anti-death penalty activist whose tireless advocacy against capital punishment had earned him the nickname Monsieur Abolition. In his 2000 memoir of the abolition struggle, Badinter described his reservations about the law. A lifelong Socialist, Badinter denied a desire to return to nineteenth-century juries of notables, who were disposed to defend “order and property at any price.” However, he observed that under the previous law, jurors were “discreetly chosen” in a way that favored “professionals, civil servants, and managers.“ © Cambridge University Press 2011.

This paper considers whether, following the transmogrification of the Lord Chancellorship over a decade ago, the backgrounds and activities of recent leaders of the Attorney-General's Office suggest the time is now right for similar changes to the Law Officers' roles. In doing so, it presents a range of original data on aspects of the role and on characteristics of Attorney-Generals, which suggests that unless self-restraint is exercised (by the Prime Minister and the post-holders) we may ineluctably be on the path to reform.

N2  - This study reexamines the political and cultural dimensions of the New World Information and Communication Order debates, which were hosted by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization during the height of the Cold War. By both revealing stakes of - and enacting the values underpinning - the contest between the 'free flow' and 'fair flow' models of the press, these debates helped determine the eventual trajectory of the globalization of journalism. After an historical review which synthesizes contemporaneous press coverage and scholarly accounts, the author offers an analysis which emphasizes the disparate cultural commitments and the 'performance' of opposition by various actors (including journalists, academics, and government officials) on each side of the debate. Although there has been significant scholarly inquiry into the New World Information and Communication Order debates and the 'MacBride Report' which emerged from them, much of the previous research has focused each side's distinct political or economic interests. By examining these debates through the lens of culture, this study illuminates the competing opinions, attitudes, and beliefs which contributed to the United States' withdrawal in protest from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (and to its reentry 20 years later) and the rise of international press freedom advocacy organizations. At a moment when elected leaders in the United States are once again ambivalent regarding their commitment to international institutions and their leadership position within international press freedom advocacy, this historical analysis offers an instructive account of a past breakdown in official diplomacy and revisits the values underpinning Western ideals of press freedom.

N2  - In the last month of 1739, the third of the Manchu rulers, the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736-1795), ordered the compilation of a treatise on medicine "to rectify medical knowledge" throughout the empire. By the end of 1742, eighty participants chosen from several offices within the palace bureaucracy based in Beijing completed the Golden Mirror of the Orthodox Lineage of Medicine, the only imperially commissioned medical text the Qing government's Imperial Printing Office published. The Golden Mirror represents both the limitations in the power of the Qianlong emperor and the dominance in the Manchu court of Chinese scholarship from the Jiangnan region during the first decade of his reign. Chinese scholars participating in the compilation of the Golden Mirror fashioned a medical orthodoxy for the empire in the mid-eighteenth century from regional trends in scholarship on history and the classics centered in the Jiangnan region since the sixteenth century. The Golden Mirror is an illuminating example of how medical scholars participated in the formation of evidential scholarship in early-modern China and why Manchu patronage, southern Chinese scholarship, and medical orthodoxy coalesced in the imperial court of the Qianlong emperor. © 2003 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

N2  - In 1973 America was gripped by its gravest political crisis since the Civil War. The president all too often was out of control. Unbridled bureaucracies acted with the arrogance befitting their autonomy. Many pressure groups exercised appalling political leverage. Increasingly disorganized, the public felt deceived and disillusioned. The threat of an inquisitorial government’s espionage-and even of armed attacks by its minions, regardless of constitutional guarantees-was in the air. A former high official of the Nixon White House, asked by a Senate Watergate Committee member what advice he would give young people inquiring about careers in government, replied-“Stay away!" The audience rocked with cynical laughter. The heritage of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln-so long miraculously intact-was crumbling to dust. © 1985 by The Committee on the Constitutional System.

N2  - Social Policy and Social Justice looks concretely at the successes and failures of a social democratic government in Canada (1971-1982) in achieving social justice through its approaches to social policy. Social policy is analyzed widely, including day care, workers' control, prescription drugs, social assistance, income distribution, legal aid and policing. Additional chapters review the NDP's re-organization of bureaucracy and allocation of expenditures. Also included are an historical synopsis of the legislation pursued in the period and an analysis of the broader political, economic and sociological contexts in Canada. Social Policy and Social Justice is the first in-depth analysis of social policy at a provincial level. It is the product of the multidisciplinary scholarship of the authors, all of whom have extensive experience in policy-making, policy advocacy or policy research. This book will be an invaluable resource for comparative purposes, particularly since there are now three NDP governments across Canada, and the NDP is undergoing re-evaluation in the wake of the 1993 federal election. It will be of particular interest to those in government, university, community-based or political organizations wanting to re-examine mainstream assumptions about social democracy, social policy and social justice in Canada. © 1995 Wilfrid Laurier University Press.

N2  - Social movement scholars credit feminist transnational advocacy networks with putting violence against women on the United Nations (UN) security agenda, as evidenced by Resolution 1325 and numerous other UN Security Council statements on gender, peace and security. Such accounts neglect the significance of superpower politics for shaping the aims of women's bureaucracies and non-governmental organizations in the UN system. This article highlights how the fall of the Soviet Union transformed the delineation of 'women's issues' at the UN and calls attention to the extent that the new focus upon 'violence against women' has been shaped by post-Cold War US global policing practices. Resolution 1325's call for gender mainstreaming of peacekeeping operations reflects the tension between feminist advocates' increased influence in security discourse and continuing reports of peacekeeper perpetrated sexual violence, abuse and exploitation.

N2  - In the 1990s, feminist scholars on the politics of rape experienced a sudden surge of interest in their, until then, marginal field. Why was the 1990s the right time for rape to become an international security problem? Furthermore, why suddenly in the 1990s did rape become problematized as an international issue not just by the feminist fringes of protest movements but also by intergovernmental bureaucracies? To explore these questions, Carol Harrington traces the historical change in the politicization of rape as an international problem and explains how early international women's organizations gained expert authority on rape by drawing on abolitionist rhetoric of bodily integrity. She discusses why they abandoned their politicization of rape in the inter-war period and why rape only reappeared as an international security question requiring gender expertise on trauma after the Cold War.

N2  - Why do some bureaucrats engage in corruption for personal gain, yet others for political gain? We show that these forms of corruption frequently do not coincide and offer an explanation: bureaucrats hired based on political and personal connections have different identities and incentives which compel them to engage in corruption for political and personal gain respectively. List experiments with a unique sample of 6400 bureaucrats in five countries in Africa and Asia support our argument. As theoretically expected, effects are strongest for bureaucrats whose political patrons remain in power (for corruption for political gain) and who do not need corruption gains to sustain their households (for corruption for personal gain). We also find that personal connections matter more than political connections for bureaucratic recruitment across surveyed countries. Our findings underscore the importance of studying varieties of bureaucratic corruption and of supplementing the politicization literature with studies of personal connections in bureaucracy. © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Public service delivery by African states is often characterized as particularist, favoring ethnic, personal or political networks of those inside the state over universalist, pro-social services to citizens. One explanation for particularist service delivery focuses on societal patronage norms, with ``Big Men{''} providing for members of their networks. Despite the prominence of this line of reasoning and the anecdotal prevalence of ``Big Men{''} in politics and society, hardly any research has quantitatively assessed the effects of ``big man{''} governance inside the state. Through a behavioral experiment with over 1,300 Ugandan bureaucrats, our article seeks to address this gap. In the experiment, we find that activating social status-that is, ``big man{''} status-in bureaucrats embedded in patronage networks significantly curbs their pro-social behavior. Our article contributes an important empirical micro-foundation to help explain one cause of limited universal service delivery by bureaucrats.

N2  - The sources of Stalin's power is one of those subjects that are much described and little studied. The scores of political biographies and general histories covering the Stalin era suggest a variety of possibilities, from the use of terror and propaganda to the appeal of his policies, but almost without exception they mention Stalin's position as General Secretary. The common story suggests that, as General Secretary, Stalin used his control over appointments to build a personal following in the Party apparatus. The mechanics of this process are sometimes referred to as ‘a circular flow of power’. Stalin appointed individual Party secretaries and gave them security of tenure. In return, they voted for him at Party Congresses. It is generally taken as given that Stalin used the power this afforded him to remove his political rivals in the course of his rise to power, and in later years, to remove those officials who had reservations about his policies. In short, Stalin's power over appointment is commonly understood not only as a key factor in his rise to power, but also as the origin of his personalistic dictatorship. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, ‘revisionist’ scholars began to cast doubt on the idea that Stalin could be sure of the personal loyalty of Party officials and that they would unquestioningly execute his will. Since the opening of the archives, a substantial body of new evidence has reinforced their views.

N2  - The notion of ``regulatory capture'' is typically used to describe the takeover of state agencies by outside interest groups that seek to weaken regulation and advance the agendas of interest groups through control over state policy levers. This concept can be contrasted with that of ``developmental capture'' of state agencies by networks of reformist bureaucrats within the state who seek to promote inclusive state social and developmental policies of benefit to the broader populace. Building on work that has pointed to instances in which state bureaucrats act autonomously from societal and political pressures, this article argues that existing explanations are insufficient for explaining Thailand's universal health care policy. It points to the critical role played by a network of bureaucrats within the state who strategically mobilized resources in the bureaucracy, political parties, civil society, and international organizations to institutionalize universal health care in the face of broader professional dissent, political uncertainty, and international pressure.

N2  - Both the Canadian and U.S. governments have determined that breast-fed
infants are among the populations most exposed to dioxins, receiving
levels of exposure orders of magnitude above those considered
acceptable. In light of the political controversy associated with
dioxins and the cultural significance of breast milk as a symbol of
purity, one might have expected dioxin contamination of breast milk to
achieve prominence on both the popular and governmental agendas. Yet as
this article demonstrates, this issue has received less media and
governmental attention than other environmental issues believed to
present comparable or lower health risks. Consistent with recent
literature on agenda denial strategies, there is some evidence that
efforts by environmental groups to publicize levels of breast milk
contamination have been rebuffed by government officials, physicians,
and breastfeeding advocacy groups fearful that women will stop
breastfeeding. However, what is more striking is just how seldom
environmentalists have attempted to reframe this issue. The article
argues that North American environmentalists have consciously chosen not
to press the dramatic issue of breast milk contamination out of concern
that mothers would discontinue breastfeeding, as well as personal
anxiety about an issue that fundamentally challenges conceptions of our
own bodies and our relationships with our children. Their self-restraint
challenges the depiction by some authors of environmental groups as
eager to capitalize on any opportunity to provoke public concern and
outrage to advance their agenda. The case study also suggests that the
literature on agenda setting must look beyond active strategies of
agenda denial by economically and politically powerful interests, to the
role of shared cultural values in shaping - and restricting - the
political agenda.

N2  - Scholars of policy networks consistently find that agreement on policy explains network ties, but inconsistent results on the importance of strategic considerations, such as the influence of potential partners. We use original data on communications between bureaucrats and lobbyists on pending Medicaid legislation to distinguish network ties (contacts) from bureaucrats’ use of those ties to attempt to advance their policy goals (requests for lobbying help). We find that policy agreement explains both the strength of network ties and bureaucrats’ requests for advocacy from their partners, but that interest group influence and unified partisan control of government explain only the latter.

N2  - Politicians across the political spectrum, from Barack Obama to Sarah Palin and Rand Paul, routinely castigate lobbyists for engaging in supposedly corrupt activities or having unequal access to elected officials. Since attaining office President Obama has imposed unprecedented new lobbying regulations, and he is not alone: both Congress and state and local legislative bodies have done so in recent years. At the same time, federal courts, relying upon the Supreme Court's new campaign finance decision in Citizens United v. FEC, have begun striking down lobbying regulations, including important regulations that limit campaign finance activities of lobbyists and impose a waiting period before legislators or legislative staffers may work as lobbyists. Two courts have held such laws could not be sustained on anticorruption grounds, and they are unlikely to be sustained on political equality grounds either. This Article advances an alternative rationale which could support some, though not all, of the recent wave of new lobbying regulations: the state's interest in promoting national economic welfare. Lobbyists threaten national economic welfare in two ways. First, lobbyists facilitate rent-seeking activities. Rentseeking occurs when individuals or groups devote resources to capturing government transfers, rather than putting them to a productive use, and lobbyists are often the key actors securing such benefits. Second, lobbyists tend to lobby for legislation that is itself an inefficient use of government resources. Part I of this Article provides an overview of the current state of lobbying regulation and lobbying jurisprudence. Part II proposes a new national economic welfare rationale for lobbying regulation. It begins by describing the political science literature on how lobbying works, as well as current statistics on the extent of lobbying on the federal level and the costs of lobbyist-driven rent-seeking on the national economy. Some of the new and proposed lobbying regulations, such as antibundling provisions and anti-revolving-door provisions, could decrease the total amount of interest group rent-seeking. The state?s national economic welfare interest must be balanced against the First Amendment costs of lobbying regulation in infringing on the right to speak and petition the government. I defend this interest as an important (even potentially compelling) state interest that justifies at least some new lobbying regulations against constitutional challenge. Part III turns to objections and extensions of the argument. I respond to objections on both ends and means. On ends, I consider the circumstances in which the promotion of national economic welfare can trump First Amendment rights. On means, I consider whether there is sufficient proof that lobbying regulations are sufficiently tailored to a reduction in rent-seeking and whether, because of the "hydraulic" nature of money in politics, attempts to regulate lobbying so as to decrease rent-seeking will be easy to evade. Under extensions, I consider whether the national economic welfare rationale could be used to justify the reenactment, as suggested by Justice Stevens, of the ban on spending corporate treasury funds in candidate elections, as well as the recent SEC "pay-to-play" rule for investment advisers.

N2  - For autocrats facing elections, officers in the internal security apparatus play a crucial role by engaging in coercion on behalf of the incumbent. Yet reliance on these officers introduces a principal-agent problem: Officers can shirk from the autocrat's demands. To solve this problem, autocrats strategically post officers to different areas based on an area's importance to the election and the expected loyalty of an individual officer, which is a function of the officer's expected benefits from the president winning reelection. Using a data set of 8,000 local security appointments within Kenya in the 1990s, one of the first of its kind for any autocracy, I find that the president's coethnic officers were sent to, and the opposition's coethnic officers were kept away from, swing areas. This article demonstrates how state institutions from a country's previous authoritarian regime can persist despite the introduction of multi-party elections and thus prevent full democratization.

Exclusion criteria:
- type of bureaucrat (lower-level officers)
N2  - The government faces a principal–agent problem with lower-level state officers. Officers are often expected to use the state coercive capacity endowed to them to politically benefit the government. But officers can shirk from the government’s demands. An officer’s actions during bouts of large-scale and highly visible electoral violence reveal the officer’s type, thereby providing the government with the information necessary to solve its principal–agent problem for the future. The government holds officers who used their authority to perpetuate incumbent-instigated violence accountable through positive rewards, while holding officers who used their authority to perpetuate opposition-instigated violence accountable through negative sanctions. We find evidence in support of the theory using micro-level archival data on 2,500 local officer appointments and fine-grained satellite data on the locations of violence in the aftermath of Kenya’s 2007 election. The Kenyan government was more likely to fire officials whose jurisdictions saw opposition-instigated violence that targeted government supporters. But we find the opposite result where violence was instigated by incumbent supporters: there, officers were less likely to be fired if violence occurred in their jurisdiction. Our results indicate that leaders can manipulate accountability processes after political violence to further politicize the state.

N2  - Many public health interventions are extremely good value for money. So why has it often proven difficult to obtain political backing for apparently common-sense public health interventions such as sewage treatment, vaccinations, or cigarette taxes? The authors use economic models of public choice, supported by plenty of examples, to explain how powerful interests groups, voting arrangements, and politicians or bureaucrats who pursue their own objectives, have shaped public health priority setting. They show that it may be perfectly rational for policy makers to accommodate these constraints in their decisions, even if it implies departing from welfare maximizing solutions.

N2  - Research on the link between turnout and corruption has produced
inconclusive evidence: while some studies find corruption to be
positively related to turnout, others report a negative relationship.
This article argues that the relevant question is not whether corruption
has a positive or negative effect on turnout, but for whom. We
hypothesize that the effect of corruption on the likelihood to vote
depends on individuals' employment sector. Public employees have
different incentives to vote in corrupt settings since their jobs often
depend on the political success of the government of the day. Hence,
while corruption dampens turnout among ordinary citizens, public
employees are more likely to vote in highly corrupt countries. Analysis
of World Values Survey data from 44 countries, shows that the
differential in voting propensity between public employees and other
citizens gets larger as corruption increases, partially confirming our
expectations.

N2  - Public prosecutors are a key element within the legal complex, and crucial to the effective implementation of legal reforms. China's procurators (public prosecutors) have previously colluded with local governments, police, and courts to ``strike hard{''} against crime while overlooking systemic beating and torture of detained suspects to obtain confessions, shoddy investigative practices, and frequent miscarriages of justice. However, fifteen sets of Guiding Cases issued by the Supreme People's Procuratorate since 2010 promote an unprecedented change in Chinese procurator culture away from ``striking hard{''} to substantive protection of criminal suspects' rights and exclusion of tainted evidence. They reinforce criminal procedure reforms since 2010 by demonstrating how procurators should protect innocent people against wrongful convictions and police brutality. They also stress the broader duty of China's procurators to uphold the public interest against corrupt businesses and officials, especially in food safety, land-taking, and environmental protection cases. With other key actors in China's ``legal complex{''}-rights lawyers and civil society groups-still suppressed by the government, this effort to transform procurator culture is an essential, though still incomplete, step on China's tortuous path toward a fair and just legal system.

N2  - Objective: In 2016, the U.K. Chief Medical Officers published revised low-risk drinking guidelines, based on an updated evidence review. These guidelines advised that men and women drink no more than 14 units per week—a reduction for men—while emphasiz-ing the dangers of drinking in pregnancy and as a risk factor for cancer. The aim of this study is to examine how the alcohol industry responded to the publication of the guidelines. Method: This article draws on 26 semi-structured interviews with civil servants, parliamentarians, and public health and civil society actors. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, anonymized, and analyzed using thematic coding. Results: Following the publication of the new draft guidelines, the U.K. alcohol industry criticized their exclusion from the guidelines development process. They then mounted a major public relations campaign that strongly criticized the guidance produced and rejected the association of drinking with cancer without recourse to evidence. The Portman Group, which was prominent in the industry response, did not recommend that members or other companies carry the revised content on product labels and sought to undermine them via high-level political lobbying. There was no formal campaign to communicate the guidelines to the public. Conclusions: The present case adds new insights into the political strategies of alcohol industry actors to undermine public health, providing evidence of confrontational tactics. It draws attention to the failure of self-regulatory regimes to incorporate basic public health messaging. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 82, 84–92, 2021). © 2021, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc..

The results showed that the pattern of patronage system (spoil system) in the official promotion of bureaucracy was still so dominant than Skills System (Merit System). This is a significant proof of the political official’s strong interest, political forces and successful team in determining promotion.

N2  - Context: Public health researchers make a limited but important contribution to policy development. Some engage with policy directly through committees, advisory boards, advocacy coalitions, ministerial briefings, intervention design consultation, and research partnerships with government, as well as by championing research-informed policy in the media. Nevertheless, the research utilization literature has paid little attention to these diverse roles and the ways that policymakers use them. This article describes how policymakers use researchers in policymaking and examines how these activities relate to models of research utilization. It also explores the extent to which policymakers' accounts of using researchers concur with the experiences of "policy-engaged" public health researchers. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with thirty-two Australian civil servants, parliamentary ministers, and ministerial advisers identified as "research-engaged" by public health researchers. We used structured and inductive coding to generate categories that we then compared with some of the major research utilization models. Findings: Policymakers were sophisticated and multifaceted users of researchers for purposes that we describe as Galvanizing Ideas, Clarification and Advice, Persuasion, and Defense. These categories overlapped but did not wholly fit with research utilization models. Despite the negative connotation, "being used" was reported as reciprocal and uncompromising, although researchers and policymakers were likely to categorize these uses differently. Policymakers countered views expressed by some researchers. That is, they sought robust dialogue and creative thinking rather than compliance, and they valued expert opinion when research was insufficient for decision making. The technical/political character of policy development shaped the ways in which researchers were used. Conclusions: Elucidating the diverse roles that public health researchers play in policymaking, and the multiple ways that policymakers use these roles, provides researchers and policymakers with a framework for negotiating and reflecting on activities that may advance the public health goals shared by both. © 2011 Milbank Memorial Fund.

N2  - This chapter presents exploratory findings on the current state of human resource management (HRM) in state government in the United States (US), with a focus on the impact of reform on what can be considered the primary unit of analysis in HRM—the employee. In exploring the research on personnel reform in the US, one must start with the question of what is wrong with civil service that requires fundamental reform. The modern civil service system, designed to combat challenges surrounding the politicization of public service employment and the associated inefficiencies, has been argued to suffer from numerous dysfunctions requiring the continued attention of reformers. The fact that so many governors appear to be waging war with their career civil servants is troubling enough, but the extent to which many appear to be winning the battle is particularly worrisome. The trends that have just been discussed are fueled in part by the election of activist governors in at least 20 states. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Under political competition, bureaucrats who wish to maintain their jobs and salaries must continue to stimulate demand for their agency’s services in order to secure funding. This paper suggests that one way a bureau can do so is by creating avenues for private entities to collect rents through entrepreneurial action. The Federal Student Aid office in the U.S. Department of Education and their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) can serve as an example. By getting students to fill out a FAFSA application, colleges obtain the detailed financial information of students and families. Colleges can then use this information to price discriminate. The bureau’s derived benefits from this behavior are two-fold: (1) Private interests groups can lobby political sponsors to continue funding the agency. Using data obtained from lobbying reports filed with the federal government, we find that there is a positive relationship between lobbying expenditures and the implementation of regulations that enhance the value of the rents associated with the FAFSA. (2) The source of the rents can be used as a performance indicator to meet the demands of political sponsors. Drawing from the 5-year strategic plans from the Department of Education and the Federal Student Aid office, we find that these bureaus can benefit from engaging in such behavior.

N2  - This article examines the management of public organizations in Brazil, taking into account both the institutional approach and that of the economic sociology. It is a fact that the management of these organizations is affected by the actions of interest groups, especially in Brazil, which is characterized by patrimonial practices, among other things. This context forces those who work in the public sphere to constantly face the dilemma of collective action, summarized in the following question: Under such conditions, is it possible for the public organizations to act in the collective interest? To answer this question, which is related to the structure-agency debate, this work suggests two responses: One that emphasizes the agency, rationality and the formation of preferences; and another, structural, based on bureaucratic insulation and social inclusion. After such considerations, and for the purpose of illustrating the relevance of the two responses, the article discusses the case of the Bolsa Familia program (family grant), highlighting the contribution of Caixa Econômica Federal and the Municipalities for the success of the program. In the end, the authors present their conclusions and recommendations for future studies.

N2  - How is it possible to analyse the seemingly contradictory modernization processes in Southeast Asian states? On the one hand, these states feature the universal characteristics of modern states, while on the other, seemingly traditional patterns such as patronage, cronyism, etc. are an integral part of their administrations. Furthermore, the states and bureaucracies are fairly stable and able to provide a framework for rapid economic development. This article combines a neo-institutionalist perspective that allows us to 'decouple' organizational structures from action structures, and thus take into account the discrepancy between the modern form and supposedly 'Asian' content of the states. It also considers the facts in the light of concepts such as 'multiple modernities' and 'contested institutionalism'. Thus, different modernization processes that lead to universalism are present, resulting from the interdependency of organizations within a global organizational field, as well as particularism which enables diversity in action. Thailand and Myanmar are taken as case studies, because Thailand has always followed a strategy of international integration, in contrast to isolationist Myanmar.

N2  - Objective Executive agencies of the federal government frequently engage in explicit political advocacy, exhorting the public to adopt policy positions and engage in political actions. This advocacy conflicts with legal restrictions on unelected bureaucrats. It is unclear what the public thinks of this kind of advocacy. We assess whether Americans judge this advocacy based on principles about acceptable political processes or based on policy goals. Methods We use observational and experimental data from two national surveys of American adults to assess the role of policy preferences in acceptance of political advocacy by executive agencies. Findings We find that Americans approve a broad range of public communications from executive agencies, but approval of political appeals is highly sensitive to whether an individual shares the policy goal of the agency. Conclusions Policy agreement, rather than preferences about process, drives Americans' attitudes toward this kind of advocacy. Americans support political advocacy by executive agencies when it dovetails with their own policy preferences or partisanship and oppose it when these agencies advocate for policies that contradict their own preferences or partisanship. Indeed, they do not draw any distinction between unelected bureaucrats and elected politicians when it comes to evaluating these forms of advocacy.

N2  - International organizations increasingly resort to strategies of legitimation in order to justify their authority and policies. This article explores one such strategy of the European Commission that targets organized interest groups with the aim to build a legitimating constituency. The members of this constituency not only contribute expertise to a policy, but also benefit from that policy and, therefore, participate in the development and confirmation of a claim to the policy's legitimacy that is put forward by EU officials. As a consequence, the agents seeking legitimacy and the addressees granting it become closely associated and "get cozy"with each other. EU officials address their claim to legitimacy to a community of co-opted elites who are likely to confirm this claim and in whose own interests it is to do so. The result is legitimation as a collaborative activity with preordained outcomes. Taking the case of the European Commission's research and innovation policy, and building in part on an ethnographic practitioner's account, the article provides an original insight into how this legitimation strategy works in everyday EU policymaking.

N2  - The shift from hierarchical-administrative water management toward more transparent, multi-level and participated governance approaches has brought about a shifting geography of players, scales of action, and means of influencing decisions and outcomes. In Spain, where the hydraulic paradigm has dominated since the early 1920s, participation in decisions over water has traditionally been limited to a closed water policy community, made up of economic water users, primarily irrigator associations and hydropower generators, civil engineering corps and large public works companies. The river basin planning process under the Water Framework Directive of the European Union presented a promise of transformation, giving access to non-economic water users, environmental concerns and the wider public to water-related information on planning and decision-making. This process coincided with the consolidation of the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) by the water administration, with the associated potential for information and data generation and dissemination. ICTs are also increasingly used by citizen groups and other interested parties as a way to communicate, network and challenge existing paradigms and official discourses over water, in the broader context of the emergence of 'technopolitics'. This paper investigates if and in what way ICTs may be providing new avenues for participated water resources management and contributing to alter the dominating power balance. We critically analyse several examples where networking possibilities provided by ICTs have enabled the articulation of interest groups and social agents that have, with different degrees of success, questioned the existing hegemonic view over water. The critical review of these cases sheds light on the opportunities and limitations of ICTs, and their relation with traditional modes of social mobilisation in creating new means of societal involvement in water governance.

N2  - This article analyzes how the lower criminal courts in Chile transitioned from an inquisitorial to an adversarial justice system between 2000 and 2005 as part of the Criminal Procedure Reform. Drawing on the frame analysis of the street-level bureaucracy and judicial ethnography, I examine the transition between two different types of judicial bureaucracy from the perspective of the actors who implemented the reform. The study is based on in-depth interviews with officials and judges of both inquisitorial and adversarial courts, administrative managers of the new courts, and actors who designed the administrative reorganization of lower criminal courts. The study involved a three-month, weekly observation in an inquisitorial court in Santiago de Chile. The article emphasizes the specificity of the Chilean judiciary, where both inquisitorial and adversarial criminal courts still coexist.

N2  - Saudi Arabia is often treated as an exceptional case by both political scientists and regional specialists. This is true in many regards, but both communities seem to overlook the fact that the nature of the kingdom as an »outlier« makes the testing and comparison of broader hypotheses of comparative politics all the more rewarding. This is especially the case with recent institutional changes in the political field, which partially fit patterns witnessed in many other authoritarian countries, but are at the same time situated in a specific Saudi context of skewed state-society relations and rentierism. Saudi Arabia has seen a modest but discernible measure of political »liberalization« since at least 2003. A number of new »interest groups« such as professional associations and a human rights organization have come into being, and elections have been held in various organizations and on the municipal level. The Kingdom seems to have departed from the old model of Saudi politics which was characterized by an omnipresent bureaucracy and a formally atomized society. The recent institutionalizations of politics in the Kingdom open up unprecedented spaces for public debate. At the same time, they signify an attempt to modernize Saudi political paternalism, a modernization, which is happening along »corporatist« lines: interest groups and interest articulation mechanisms are licensed and more or less controlled by the state. They have monopolies on specific, exclusive task areas and are therefore organized in accordance with functional criteria. This set-up is quite different from the Western (or Anglo-American) ideal-type of »pluralism« which stipulates a free interplay of competing and overlapping interest groups which exist independently of the state. A striking characteristic of the recent corporatist moves is that most of the new formal groups have been created above society, with very weak links to the broader groups they are supposed to represent. The explanation lies in the informal nature of politics in Saudi Arabia and the absence of an associational tradition in the patronage-based Saudi rentier system. The inclusion of business in formal policy-making is an analytically important exception to this: different from other groups, it is politically meaningful, as Saudi business has a tradition of formal organization and lobbying, and has been granted space to develop historically. None of this is true of the other, recently created »civil society« organizations. This is why business inclusion is a success in terms of formal interest intermediation, whereas the activities of other groups appear anemic and politically irrelevant. Saudi corporatism is similar to that in a number of other, smaller Gulf states, where recent interest group politics also have a somewhat artificial flavor. As traditional corporatist interest groups in republican Arab regimes have lost much of their traditional mobilizational function, there might be a broader trend of convergence in the Arab world.

N2  - Over the past few decades and throughout the world, numerous government- initiated experiments and attempts at directly engaging and including citizens have emerged as remedies for a variety of problems faced by modern democracies. On the level of local practice, these attempts have been given many names, such as citizen panels, deliberative fora, collaborative dialogues, etc. In the academic literature as well, the phenomenon is subsumed under many different headings-for instance, collaborative, deliberative, or interactive governance. In this book, we refer to this empirical phenomenon as local participatory governance; that is, government-sponsored direct participation between invited citizens and local officials in concrete arrangements and concerning problems that affect them. Hence the object of interest here is local governments’ invitations to participation, directed at individuals rather than interest groups or voluntary organizations.

N2  - This article examines the various religious interest groups in American politics. These interest groups actually occupy an important position within the American political process: they serve as a form of "intermediary"-agents existing between the elected officials and the mass public. The article studies the institutional growth of national religious interest groups, looks at the rise of the New Religious Right, and inspects the different organizational dynamics of these groups. This article suggests that the collective activities of religious interest groups-including local community organizing and lobbying state governments-contribute to a more authentic neopluralism than what is seen in a general interest group scholarship.

N2  - In this revised text of the 2018 Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture, we encounter two communities—one a village in highland Crete, the other a small enclave in the old core of Bangkok—against which bureaucratic forces have exercised disproportionate violence, claiming to do so in response to what are openly admitted to be infractions of formal law. The particularly harsh punishments meted out to these communities, in contrast to what has happened to other, otherwise similarly insubordinate local groups, calls for a specific explanation. This would seem to lie at least partly in the residents’ tactic of subversive archaism, in which residents, through a variety of performative acts, challenge the moral authority of bureaucracies modeled on Western prototypes and imbued with Western-derived and middle-class notions of order and style. While other elements (such as shifts in the distribution of patronage) may shed light on the selective character of the state’s reprisals, the threat that subversive archaism poses to the cultural legitimacy of state and municipal bureaucracies emerges as a broader way of accounting for the official deployment of violence against groups of people whose flamboyant traditionalism ostensibly represents them as the most fundamentally loyal citizens of all.

N2  - Scientific research and expertise play a critical role in informing legislative decisions and guiding effective policy. However, significant communication gaps persist between scientists and policymakers. While interest in science policy among researchers has substantially increased in recent decades, traditional academic and research careers rarely provide formal training or exposure to the inner workings of government, public policy, or communicating scientific findings to broad audiences. Here, we offer 10 practical steps for scientists who want to engage in science policy efforts, with a focus on state and federal policy in the United States. We first include a primer to government structure and tailoring science communication for a policymaker audience. We then provide action-oriented steps that focus on arranging and successfully navigating meetings with government officials. Finally, we suggest structural steps in academia that would provide resources and support for students, researchers, and faculty who are interested in policy. We offer our perspective, as early-career marine scientists who have participated in policy discussions at state and federal levels and through the American Geophysical Union's "Voices for Science" program. This guide offers potential pathways for engagement in science policy, and provides researchers with tangible actions to effectively reach stakeholders. Lastly, we hope to activate further conversations on best practices for policy engagement, particularly for researchers interested in careers at the science policy interface.

N2  - This article examines the relationship between management of the ministerial bureaucracy and the risk of high-level corruption in Poland. Four danger zones of corruption in the ministerial bureaucracy are distinguished, comprising the personalisation of appointments, the emergence of multiple dependencies, the screening capacity of the personnel system and the incentive of bureaucrats to develop a reputation of honesty and competence. Empirically, the article investigates the case of Poland from 1997 until 2007 and sets the findings in a comparative East Central European perspective. The article shows that corruption risks in the ministerial bureaucracy increased in most but not all danger zones after 2001 and, in particular, during the period of the centre-right governments that were in office between 2005 and 2007. The increase in corruption risks is reflected in Poland's deteriorating corruption record during the same period. The conclusion discusses the findings with regard to alternative causes of corruption and the relationship between civil service professionalisation and corruption in other East Central European countries.

N2  - Studies of representative bureaucracy (RB) argue public organizations reflective of the public they serve exhibit better outcomes, especially when serving underrepresented groups. RB theory attributes improved outcomes either to the actions representative bureaucrats take (active representation), or a greater perception of trust and legitimacy toward them by service recipients (symbolic representation), largely treating active and symbolic representation as separate phenomena. We explore the intricate relationship between bureaucracies and the populations they serve by observing the cross-influence between active and symbolic representation, as revealed by self-reported outcomes in discrimination complaints (N = 1,372) referred for voluntary mediation in the United States Postal Service, the REDRESS (c) program, a context in which mediators are highly limited in representing a claimant's interests given the requirement of impartiality. In exit surveys measuring employee perceptions of organizational justice, we observed the impact of race and gender representation by gauging changes in reported satisfaction when a mediator's race or gender matched the nature of the complaint in cases of race or sex discrimination and sexual harassment, via multivariate regression estimation. These analyses support RB theory regarding sexual harassment complaints, where complainants rated outcomes significantly more favorably for female mediators. We found a negative correlation between female mediators and sex discrimination complaints, as well as African American mediators and race discrimination complainants. To explain this discrepancy, we argue that interactions between symbolic and active representation determine the expectations and perceptions placed on bureaucrats. When a bureaucrat does not meet those expectations, service recipients tend to have a more negative view of organizational justice outcomes.

N2  - To enhance government accountability, reformers have advocated strengthening institutions of “horizontal accountability,” particularly auditing institutions that can punish lawbreaking elected officials. Yet, these institutions differ in their willingness to punish corrupt politicians, which is often attributed to variation in their degree of independence from the political branches. Taking advantage of a randomized natural experiment embedded in Brazil’s State Audit Courts, we study how variation in the appointment mechanisms for choosing auditors affects political accountability. We show that auditors appointed under few constraints by elected officials punish lawbreaking politicians—particularly co-partisans—at lower rates than bureaucrats insulated from political influence. In addition, we find that even when executives are heavily constrained in their appointment of auditors by meritocratic and professional requirements, auditors still exhibit a pro-politician bias in decision making. Our results suggest that removing bias requires a level of insulation from politics rare among institutions of horizontal accountability.

N2  - One of the exceptionalities of the Middle East is the existence of sectarian identities along with late modern institutions, such as nation state. While modern states in the region struggle for coexistence, imperial authorities, especially Ottoman, was relatively successful to endure its rule over different identities as minority across region. It is recorded that the Ottomans' long history as imperium is supported by their ability to develop and implement system to incorporate different identities under their rule known as millet system. Historical exploration as used in this paper suggests that the concept was adopted from Islamic teologic tradition in respond to the reality of mixture society in newly conquered territories which resembles the character of the Ottomanism itself since Suleyman. The mundane aspect of the millet system can be seen from the way of the Ottomans' rulers handling the major minority groups such as Greeks and Jews based on their personal or social and economic capabilities. One of the obvious beneficial relations with the groups is the ability to do trading and fill positions in foreign services that lead particular group to enjoy better position in bureaucracy and society. The differences, in fact, have influenced the arrangement and treatment of the Ottoman rulers towards them over time which were also heavily affected by political changing in the case of the Greeks for example. Therefore, the arrangements of the minority groups are based on mutual benefit that suits both objectives which was able to last for centuries. However, it is also found that the Greeks and Jews' ability to survive is heavily based the character of Ottoman bureaucracy which is patrimonial. In that case, patronage relation is important and acknowledgement on merit and achievement is rarely found. © 2012, Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies. Salah satu aspek yang membuat kawasan Timur Tengah berbeda adalah keberadaan identitas-identitas yang bersifat sektarian bersamaan dengan dibangunnya lembaga-lembaga modern, seperti negara bangsa. Sementara konsep negara terkini di kawasan itu berjuang untuk mempertahankan kehidupan ssecara bersama, penguasa-penguasa kerajaan seperti Ottoman, dapat dikatakan berhasil mempertahankan kekuasaannya atas kelompok-kelompok masyarakat kecil dengan identitas yang berbeda di berbagai wilayah. Tercatat bahwa sejarah panjang Ottoman sebagai sebuah kerajaan didukung oleh kemampuan mereka untuk membangun dan menerapkan sebuah cara yang dikenal dengan millet untuk menerima dan menyerap identitas yang berbeda di bawah kekuasaan mereka. Penelusuran sejarah seperti yang dilakukan di dalam tulisan ini menyarankan bahwa istlah millet itu diambil dari tradisi teologi Islam sebagai tanggapan terhadap realitas kemajemukan masyarakat di daerah-daerah yang baru ditaklukkan dan ini pada dasarnya menggambarkan ciri khas dari cara pandang Ottoman sejak Suleyman. Unsur keduniaan dari sistem tersebut dapat dilihat dari cara penguasa-penguasa Ottoman menangani kelompok-kelompok minoritas yang utama seperti Yunani dan Yahudi yand didasarkan atas kemampuan perorangan ataupun kelebihan ekonomi dan sosialnya. Salah satu contoh nyata hubungan yang saling menguntungkan dengan mereka adalah kemampuan untuk berdagang dan mengisi jabatan-jabatan di kantor hubungan luar negeri yang membuat sebagian dari mereka menikmati posisi yang lebih baik di pemerintahan maupun masyarakat. Perbedaan-perbedaan itu, pada kenyatannya, telah mempengaruhi pula penanganan dan perlakuan penguasapenguasa Ottoman terhadap mereka dalam jangka waktu yang lama yang juga dipengaruhi oleh perubahan politik seperti yang terjadi pada kelompok Yunani. Karenanya, penanganan yang berbeda terhadap kelompok-kelompok minoritas itu pada dasarnya saling menguntungkan dan hal itu sesuai dengan kebutuhan kedua belah pihak dan mampu bertahan dalam kurun waktu berabad-abad. Selain itu, tulisan ini juga mengungkap bahwa kemampuan kelompok Yunani dan Yahudi untuk mempertahankan posisi mereka di hadapan penguasa bergantung kepada karakter birokrasi Ottoman sendiri yang bersifat patrimonial. Dalam kasus ini, hubungan yang bersifat patronase menjadi penting dan pengakuan terhadap prestasi dan pencapaian kerja dapat dikatakan jarang ditemukan. © 2012, Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies.

N2  - On September 11, 1973, General Augusto Pinochet helped lead the overthrow of one of Latin America's most democratic regimes. As part of the coup, Chile's military leaders bombed the presidential palace, shut down the Congress, banned political parties, and purged the state bureaucracy. They left the courts, however, completely untouched. Pledging their commitment to judicial independence, the generals kept intact the long-standing system of judicial appointment, evaluation, discipline, and promotion, which placed primary control in the hands of the Supreme Court, and refrained from dictating or otherwise manipulating judicial decisions. The 1925 constitution, which provided a host of liberal and democratic guarantees, remained formally in effect, though the junta gradually (and sometimes retroactively or secretly) supplanted many of these with their own decree-laws, and later, their own constitution. Throughout, the military government insisted it was acting in the name of the rule of law, though its approach violated the most basic principles of that concept.Despite the formal independence they enjoyed, however, and the resources that the country's legal texts and traditions provided them, Chilean courts never sought to challenge the undemocratic, illiberal, and antilegal policies of the military government. Indeed, they cooperated fully with the authoritarian regime, granting it a mantle of legitimacy not only during the seventeen years of dictatorship, but well beyond the transition back to formal democracy in 1990 (see Hilbink 2007: Ch. 5).

N2  - All medical workers have a duty to protect a patient's privacy by law. Civil servants have a duty to prosecute anyone if a crime has been committed and others have the right to prosecute. When medical workers find their patient using illegal drugs, they are in a situation where any possible action they take is either a breach of one of the duties or an abandonment of the right to prosecute. Any worker in this situation should choose to do what will greater benefit society. Medical workers should avoid prosecuting a patient for illegal drug use, so that drug users can seek help. At the same time medical workers should try to put the patient in a situation where the patient's drug use in the future can be treated by the criminal justice system.

N2  - We analyze a model of policy making in which only one actor (e.g., a bureaucratic agency or a well-funded interest group) has the capacity to develop high-quality policy proposals. By virtue of her skills, this actor has an effective monopoly on policy development and thus can craft proposals that are good for herself but provide few benefits to decision makers who enact policies. We then examine institutional responses that decision makers can use to induce a policy-development monopolist to craft more appealing proposals: (i) establishing in-house policy development capacity, (ii) delegating authority to an agent who counterbalances the monopolist’s preferences, and (iii) fostering competition by policy developers with different preferences. We apply our model to a diverse set of contexts, including lobbying in term-limited state legislatures, regulation of banking and financial services, and administrative procedures for rule making in US federal bureaucracies.

N2  - This paper, based largely on interviews, examines relations between the state and a number of societal groups - business, students, the sangha (monks), peasants and workers - in Burma since independence. It argues that state-society relations in Burma cannot be reduced to a series of zero-sum games. Although it is possible that the relations between the state and anti-state activists, such as students and monks, would take the form of zero-sum games, it is argued here that existing studies fail to explain the complexity of the state's relations with those segments of the Burmese population not actively opposed to the state, such as the business community. The paper explores the mutually empowering aspect of state-society relations in Burma by highlighting the benefits that both post-colonial Burmese government officials and various societal groups have gained from their patronage networks. It further shows that, although the parliamentary period was a more democratic one than the two subsequent military periods, the bedrock of state-society relations in Burma throughout the post-colonial period has been clientelism.

N2  - Of all the Chinese societies, Taiwan witnessed the first peaceful and democratic power transfer in 2000. With the coming to power of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), new political opportunity was opened up for environmentalists, who had been aligned with the DPP for more than a decade. Did the regime change provide a better milieu for synergy between environmental activists and state officials? Was a better style of environmental governance possible under the DPP government? These are the main questions this paper tries to raise and answer. A puzzle has been found here. While environmentalists have gained important access to policy decision-making, pro-development counter-mobilizations were also on the rise, and government policy shifted to a more pro-business stand consequently. This paper argues that this paradox resulted from the weakened state capacity, which simultaneously empowered environmentalists and could not resist business's lobbying.

N2  - How do investors enter and navigate markets where there is a general lack of access to information and where the law is open to interpretation? Drawing on interview data with 100 research subjects in Vietnam’s real estate market, this article makes contributions to the literatures of economic sociology and development. First, looking at a diverse set of local, regional, and global investors, I theorize how market actors pursue different strategies to manage risky investments based on their proximity to state officials. Investors’ proximity depends on four processes: legal/regulatory, social ties, cultural matching, and stage of investment. Second, I highlight how multiple state–market relations can coexist within the same state. Investors’ varying levels of proximity to government officials shape their relationship with the state as one of patronage (predatory), mutual destruction (mutual hostage), or transparency (developmental). Heterogeneous state–market relations help account for the persistence of foreign direct investment in markets that display both a great deal of corruption and a great deal of legality and transparency. © American Sociological Association 2018.

N2  - The detention of child soldiers is an example of an intractable policy controversy. In their advocacy of governance responses, policy-relevant actors adopt reductionist frames either of ?victims? ? that require special protections ? or of ?perpetrators? that necessitate the detention of individuals deemed threats. This article examines how the framing of a controversy influences policy responses. The ways in which policy actors in Canada and the United States acted from their frames and responded to frames of others on the issue of the detention of child soldiers is analyzed. Forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), government officials, and military lawyers ? across two national contexts ? to build a comprehensive picture of these framing contests. Findings show that policy actors in both countries employed frame-diverging moves that prolong policy controversies. However, the adoption of the Canadian doctrine presents an example of a convergence of frames. NGOs and government officials engaged in strategies to create a shared framing that allowed to move beyond the perceived dilemma of child soldiers either as ?victims? or ?perpetrators.? These findings enhance not only our understanding of how framing dynamics shape governance responses but also demonstrate opportunities of using the research on framing processes in investigating complex experiences of children in conflict zones.

N2  - Patronage is treated as a discrete phenomenon through which political, bureaucratic, and wider social behaviour may be analysed and explained. As such, it is commonly seen as an obstacle to (or as a stopgap for) effective administration; as a feature that is in some respects compatible with (and may aid) democracy; and as behaviour that is quite simply different from practice within Weberian bureaucracies. I wish to point this debate along a slightly different path. I suggest that a more nuanced approach (and one closer to everyday experience) is yielded when patronage is recognized as an aspect of social relationships. Viewed in this light, there is more than enough material in the existing literature to reveal a link between patronage, formal organizations and democracy. I then go on to discuss briefly why relationships modulate such that certain aspects are brought to the fore; and to consider the implications of this explanation for existing views on patronage and the genesis of organizations and democratic patterns.

N2  - Direct democracy was originally a progressive instrument designed to break the power of corrupt state governments and corporations. Today, it has become a tool of corporations and well-funded interest groups that claim to speak for the people but instead seek only to further their own agendas. Oregon has seen both the heights to which a state can rise under direct democracy and the depths to which it can sink. Ballot measures that mandate tax cuts and funding for programs have taken budgets out of the hands of state legislators. Initiative activists have utilized the system to discriminate against minorities. Fraudulent signature gathering has shaken the public's confidence in the system's integrity. In response, progressives have sought to rein in direct democracy, or at least minimize the harms with which it has become synonymous. Toward that end, Oregon state officials have increased the difficulty of placing initiatives on the ballot. The Oregon Supreme Court recently interpreted the state constitution to bar initiatives that make more than one constitutional amendment at a time. These efforts set a positive example for other states to follow. But Oregon and other direct democracy states must do more. They should, for instance, improve their tracking and publication of ballot measure campaign finances and prohibit initiatives that discriminate against minorities or commandeer state funding. These and other steps would cure most of direct democracy's defects while retaining its advantages and preserving its progressive heritage.

N2  - At the 1999 Tampere Council Summit, the Heads of the European Union (EU) Member States agreed to create common standards for refugees and persons in need of subsidiary protection by 2012. In 2004, as part of the Common European Asylum System, a first version of the Qualification Directive was adopted. In its effort to further approximate the rights of refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, the Commission opened a recast process on the Qualification Directive in 2009. The negotiations of both directives have been followed actively by pro-migrant groups. Their intensified political involvement and presence in Brussels did not remain unnoticed by political scientists. However, previous studies mainly focused on the analysis of the factors that affect the emergence of such groups and the variety of their missions. This article, in turn, firstly, identifies those pro-migrant groups active in lobbying on both Qualification Directives; secondly, explores their lobbying strategies; and thirdly, assesses to what extent political opportunity structures affected the lobbying choice of the pro-migrant groups. Analysing the lobbying efforts of the pro-migrant groups on the original Qualification Directive and its post-Lisbon recast allows for an evaluation of whether the groups have benefited from the modified decision-making procedures. The study is based on a documentary analysis of the strategy papers and recommendations of the groups, as well as on 28 in-depth expert interviews with EU officials and interest representatives.

N2  - US states are active in enacting immigration policies, which vary widely and have substantial impact on the lives of immigrants. Our understanding of what produces these divergent state laws remains limited. Qualitative research demonstrates the importance of a 2010 immigration compact, supported by a powerful religious organization, in shaping immigration policies in Utah, and the Utah Compact was held up as a model for other states. But is the experience of Utah applicable across other states? We test the effects of compacts and interest groups on immigration policy adoption across all 50 states between 2005 and 2013. Our findings suggest that compacts are actually associated with more restrictive immigration policy. Although states with compacts are more likely to pass inclusive immigration laws, these are counterbalanced by higher numbers of exclusive laws. Both religious and non-religious interests groups are associated with policy, but they do not explain the effects of compacts.

N2  - A vacant presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed position (herein, "advice and consent position") can be filled temporarily under one of several authorities that do not require going through the Senate confirmation process. Under specific circumstances, many executive branch vacancies can be filled temporarily under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 or by recess appointment. In some cases, temporary filling of vacancies in a particular position is specifically provided for in statute. Generally, designation or appointment under one of these methods confers upon the official the legal authority to carry out the duties of the office. Alternatively, an individual may be hired by the agency as a consultant. A consultant does not carry the legal authority of the office, and may act only in an advisory capacity.

N2  - The appointment process for advice and consent positions consists of three main stages. The first stage is selection, clearance, and nomination by the President. This step includes preliminary vetting, background checks, and ethics checks of potential nominees. At this stage, the president may also consult with Senators who are from the same party if the position is located in a state. The second stage of the process is consideration of the nomination in the Senate, most of which takes place in committee. Finally, if a nomination is approved by the full Senate, the nominee is given a commission signed by the President, which makes the nomination official. During the 110th Congress, the President submitted to the Senate 172 nominations to executive department full-time positions. Of these 172 nominations, 125 were confirmed; 13 were withdrawn; and 34 were returned to him in accordance with Senate rules. For those nominations that were confirmed, an average of 104 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 92. The methodology used in this report to count the length of time between nomination and confirmation differs from that which was used in previous similar CRS reports. The statistics presented here include the days during which the Senate was adjourned for its summer recesses and between sessions of Congress. The methodological change, which may reduce the comparability of statistics in this report with those of the earlier research, is discussed in the text of this report as well as in an appendix. Reasons for the change include the conversion of long recesses into a series of short recesses punctuated by pro forma sessions during the 110th Congress; the fact that although committees may not be taking direct action on nominations in the form of hearings or votes, they are likely still considering and processing nominations during recesses; and a desire to be consistent with the methodology used by many political scientists as well as CRS research on judicial nominations. In addition, an argument could be made that the decision to extend Senate consideration of nominees over the course of a recess is intentional, and the choice to extend this length of time is better represented by including all days, including long recesses. President George W. Bush did not make any recess appointments to executive department full-time positions during the 110th Congress. Information for this report was compiled from data from the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System http://www.congress the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code, and the 2008 "Plum Book" (United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions).

N2  - Background: Transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) may respond to processes of regional trade integration both by acting politically to influence policy and by reorganising their own operations. The Central American Common Market (CACM) was reinvigorated in the 1990s, reflecting processes of regional trade liberalisation in Latin America and globally. This study aimed to ascertain how British American Tobacco (BAT), which dominated the markets of the CACM, sought to influence policy towards it by member country governments and how the CACM process impacted upon BAT's operations.Methods: The study analysed internal tobacco industry documents released as a result of litigation in the US and available from the online Legacy Tobacco Documents Library at http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/. Documents were retrieved by searching the BAT collection using key terms in an iterative process. Analysis was based on an interpretive approach involving a process of attempting to understand the meanings of individual documents and relating these to other documents in the set, identifying the central themes of documents and clusters of documents, contextualising the documentary data, and choosing representative material in order to present findings.Results: Utilising its multinational character, BAT was able to act in a coordinated way across the member countries of the CACM to influence tariffs and taxes to its advantage. Documents demonstrate a high degree of access to governments and officials. The company conducted a coordinated, and largely successful, attempt to keep external tariff rates for cigarettes high and to reduce external tariffs for key inputs, whilst also influencing the harmonisation of excise taxes between countries. Protected by these high external tariffs, it reorganised its own operations to take advantage of regional economies of scale. In direct contradiction to arguments presented to CACM governments that affording the tobacco industry protection via high cigarette tariffs would safeguard employment, the company's regional reorganisation involved the loss of hundreds of jobs.Conclusions: Regional integration organisations and their member states should be aware of the capacity of TTCs to act in a coordinated transnational manner to influence policy in their own interests, and coordinate their own public health and tax policies in a similarly effective way.

N2  - Background: It is widely believed that corporate actors exert substantial influence on the making of public health policy, including in the alcohol field. However, the industry is far from being monolithic, comprising a range of producers and retailers with varying and diverse interests. With a focus on contemporary debates concerning the minimum pricing of alcohol in the UK, this study examined the differing interests of actors within the alcohol industry, the cleavages which emerged between them on this issue and how this impacted on their ability to organise themselves collectively to influence the policy process. We conducted 35 semi-structured interviews between June and November 2010 with respondents from all sectors of the industry as well as a range of nonindustry actors who had knowledge of the alcohol policy process, including former Ministers, Members of the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, civil servants, members of civil society organisations and professionals. Methods: The paper draws on an analysis of publicly available documents and 35 semi-structured interviews with respondents from the alcohol industry (on-and off-trade including retailers, producers of wines, spirits and beers and trade associations) and a range of non-industry actors with knowledge of the alcohol policy process (including former Ministers, Members of Parliament and of the Scottish Parliament, civil servants, members of civil society organisations and professional groups). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using Nvivo qualitative analysis software. Processes of triangulation between data sources and different types of respondent sought to ensure we gained as accurate a picture as possible of industry participation in the policy process. Results: Divergences of interest were evident between producers and retailers and within the retail sector between the on and off trade. Divisions within the alcohol industry, however, existed not only between these sectors, but within them. Cleavages were evident within the producer sector between different product categories and within the retail sector between different types of off-trade retailers. However, trade associations were particularly important in providing a means by which the entire industry, or broad sectors within it, could speak with a single voice, despite the limitations on this. There was also evidence of ad-hoc cooperation on specific issues, which resulted from both formal and informal contacts between industry actors. Conclusions: Alcohol industry corporations and trade associations collaborate with one another effectively where there are shared interests, allowing the best placed bodies to lead on a given issue. Thus, whilst industry actors may be deeply divided on certain issues they are able to coordinate their positions on occasions where there are clear advantages in so doing. Health policymakers may benefit from an awareness of the multiplicity of interests within the industry and the ways that these may shape collective lobbying positions.

government departments; use of organized business groups such as the
Multinational Chairmen's Group and the European Round Table; and
participation and leadership in forums organized by Chatham House. These
processes contributed to significant concessions on the liberalization
of the tobacco market in China, although the failure to break the
Chinese state monopoly over the manufacture and distribution of
cigarettes has ensured that foreign tobacco companies' share of the
Chinese market has remained small. World Trade Organization accession
has nevertheless led to a profound restructuring of the Chinese tobacco
industry in anticipation of foreign competition, which may result in
more market-based and internationally oriented Chinese tobacco firms.

N2  - Much of the bureaucratic literature suggests that, when staffing the bureaucracy, executives want agents who are both responsive to their political needs and possess the competence needed to fulfill their directives. However, institutional barriers-such as the requirement for legislative confirmation-exist that may make pursuing a strategy of responsive competence difficult, if not impossible. Here, I examine a model of bureaucratic appointments that allows for informationally imperfect agencies. I show that when legislative assent is required, trade-offs between ideology and either patronage or agency performance-or both-are often required to ensure legislative confirmation. The same dynamics are not present for unilateral appointments. Finally, using a data set that incorporates the ideologies of federal program managers, the performance of federal programs, and whether program managers were patronage appointees, I conduct a series of empirical tests that support the model's predictions.

N2  - In this article, Peter Holquist traces both the institutional culture and personnel of one key late-imperial era agency, the Resettlement Administration, based within the Main Administration of Land Management. and Agriculture. Holquist examines the technocratic ethos of a close-knit set of officials within the Resettlement Administration's central office, a group who from 1906 to 1917 oversaw plans to develop the empire's peripheries as well as incorporate territories annexed during World War I. Crucial to all their plans was a commitment to the rational and scientific administration of the empire's people and resources under the aegis of the central state. This ethos informed policies during the last decade of the old regime and throughout World War I and both this ethos and this cohort of officials influenced the state policy of Red and White government during die civil war and laid the foundation For the Soviet state's colonization programs in the early 1920s.

N2  - We compared sharing economy development in 90 countries to demonstrate that higher qualities of government are associated with greater sharing economy growth. To explain this finding, we assumed that sharing economy benefits are enjoyed by the public, whereas its costs are chiefly borne by market incumbents. In considering these competing interests, policymakers tend to favor the latter as single-industry interests that can be more easily organized to influence policymaking. We then hypothesized that an electorally competitive, depoliticized, and effective government may tilt the balance against the entrenched market incumbents, leading to the growth of sharing economy industries. Overall, we found some support for this hypothesis. We especially found that electoral competitiveness strongly impacted sharing economy development and that this impact was significantly greater in a country with a depoliticized bureaucracy and effective government.

N2  - This study investigates the concept of bureaucratic competence. Specifically, we challenge the argument that a “careerists’ premium”—the tendency for public services run by careerists to receive better performance evaluations than services administered by other types of public managers—necessarily is explained by the superior expertise of career bureaucrats. Evidence that forms the basis of this possibility comes from performance evaluations of Korean state-owned enterprises (SOEs) managed by different types of executives between 2000 and 2015. The results of our analyses provide support for the existence of a careerists’ premium. However, we find that the premium is most salient and significant when executives had retired from the governmental agency that oversees the performance-evaluation process. Moreover, the gap between qualitative and quantitative assessment scores increase significantly when the evaluated SOEs are managed by career executives who have retired from the regulating agency. This result suggests that the oft-cited careerists’ premium may not necessarily signify careerists’ greater expertise; it may also be the product of lobbying and regulatory capture.

N2  - This article explores how political principals weigh loyalty and
competence in public personnel decisions. Exploiting the abrupt shift in
political leadership following the impeachment of President Park
Geun-hye of Korea, the authors examine how the newly elected president
made the decision to retain or dismiss 118 agency heads appointed by the
previous administration. The evidence shows the importance of loyalty in
managerial survival: those who had a political patronage relationship
with the ousted president were less likely to survive in the new
administration. However, the authors also demonstrate the relevance of
competence, as measured by the outcomes of agency performance
evaluation. Further, the article shows the existence of negativity bias:
the punishment for low performance is greater than the reward for high
performance. Finally, the authors provide support for the idea that
political principals reward loyalists, but only if they show acceptable
levels of competence.

N2  - Does the revolving door phenomenon erode bureaucratic integrity? To answer this question, we undertake a quantitative case study of a private university in South Korea that recruited a former vice minister of education as its president. Specifically, we investigate whether after employing this high-ranking former public official the university received favorable treatment from the education ministry in terms of funding. Estimates from difference-in-difference, triple difference, and synthetic control methods all suggest that the high-profile public official’s recruitment is associated with financial benefits from the official’s former employing agency; no such advantage, however, was observed for benefits from other agencies. This result offers suggestive but compelling evidence that the revolving door distorts the allocation of government resources; the financial benefits the university received are due not to the recruited official’s greater competence, expertise, or knowledge but rather to his implicit collusion with the government.

N2  - By introducing civil service reform into major federal offices, Rutherford B. Hayes laid the foundation for the modern American bureaucracy. This chapter deals with the reform regulations of the Progressive Era and beyond. The spoils system of recruiting civil servants had three major characteristics: appointment primarily for political considerations, congressional dictation of appointments, and rotation in office. As the spoils system became entrenched, its deleterious effects on the civil service appeared. The movement to reform the civil service arose during the struggle over reconstructing the Union. With peace and Lincoln’s assassination, the Reconstruction of the Union was of paramount concern. Hayes and his administration’s limited reform measures kept reformers oscillating between happiness and disappointment. The Civil Service Reform Act was passed in 1883, not only because reformers exploited the circumstances of Garfield’s assassination, but also because Hayes had demonstrated the value of the merit system.

N2  - Voters are increasingly concerned that special interests control the policy process. Yet, the literature on representation is more optimistic: elected officials face strong incentives to listen to voters—not just lobby groups—and this makes for more responsive policies. Building on recent work, we argue a more nuanced point: different types of groups have different effects on responsiveness. We show empirically that lobbying from “cause” groups—representing diffuse interests like climate change—strengthens responsiveness, while lobbying from “sectional” groups—representing industry and professional associations—has no observable effect. Our project uses a novel data set of Canadian lobbying registrations spanning fifteen policy areas from 1990 to 2009. Using a dynamic panel model, we test how interest group lobbying moderates the effect of voter issue attention on government spending. Our findings contribute to contemporary debates over the influence of organized groups, suggesting some interest groups may improve representation.

N2  - This book begins with the story of efforts to reform the law of homicide in England and Wales. Having wrested control over the direction of reform from the judiciary, successive governments have been content to oversee a narrowly focused, pluralist model of reform. Under this model, individuals and interest groups - extending to bureaucratised lay bodies representing a variety of special interests - compete for a reforming influence with civil servants and ministers. However, what has remained neglected is any serious attempt by government to discover the views of the general public on homicide law reform. The book argues that comprehensive research into, and a degree of deference to, public opinion on the scope of homicide is essential to the reform process. It is essential principally as a means of conferring true legitimacy on homicide reform in a democracy. Elite or expert opinion alone will never authentically secure such legitimacy. A true liberal democracy will build in to legislation opportunities for citizens in good conscience periodically to oppose cherished liberal principles currently governing homicide law. The book goes on to examine many of the key issues in the current law, such as the ever-weakening case for 'partial' defences to murder, the need to hold public authorities to account for corporate manslaughter, secondary liability for murder, the case for 'one-punch' manslaughter, and the bureaucratisation of some forms of homicide, such as causing death by dangerous driving, that have departed in their structure and operation from the common law manslaughter principles that formerly governed them.

N2  - Certain indices serve as benchmarks for democracy. All but a tiny fringe of the Japanese people embrace the ideal of democracy and feel that they have a working democracy. Under universal suffrage of those over 20, elections are held by secret ballot to choose and change governments. Participation has been high until recently. Balloting is fair, however much the electoral system itself has needed revision. Governments reflect the nation’s priorities.1 They have brought freedom, peace, prosperity and prestige to the people. The Japanese have created a high level of resource distribution, which has fostered an open society where "If we work hard, our lives will improve accordingly."2 The Constitution protects civil rights including free speech and assembly, enforced by a legal system, that has its singular accents. For instance, there are no political prisoners, however legal maneuvering allows for "unconvicted detention," which keeps extremists out of society long enough to dilute their effectiveness.3 There is no official censorship. Mass media includes television critique, public debate, and one of the world’s most prolific publication industries.4 The nation has a highly trained, professional, and apolitical civil service, obedient to the nation’s economic and political welfare, although it embodies the contradiction of a free economy managed by Mandarin bureaucrats. Interest groups have wide interaction in the policy process including public-private deliberation councils called.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the nature and scale of the decline of the principles of free election of Cossack officers of Hetmanshchyna, due to the intervention of the Russian authorities in the process of staffing hundreds of governments. The research methodology is based on comparison strategies and typology. The scientific novelty is connected with the study of the influence of the imperial center on the nature of the administrative practices of the Ukrainian autonomy 17-18 centuries. Through the establishment of control over the personnel policy of Hetmanshchyna and the deliberate erosion of the principles of free election of Cossack officers. Attention is paid primarily to the efforts of the imperial authorities after the defeat of the antiRussian speech of Hetman I.Mazepa in 1708-1709 to change the legal field of the electoral process, on the one hand, limiting the will of the Cossack society and the participation of regimental officers, and on the other - putting it under the control of its officials. Examples of direct appointment to the hundreds in Ukraine by decrees of the tsar, the Senate and other governing institutions of the Russian Empire in circumvention of the legal norms and traditions in force in Hetmanshchyna are considered in detail. Procedural features are reconstructed and the motivation of such personnel decisions is clarified. In particular, attention is drawn to the fact that in substantiating such appointments, the token ``loyalty to the monarch{''} clearly dominates the motives of outstanding abilities or merits of the candidates. In addition, it was established that a significant part of the officers appointed in this way came from Balkans and before that was in no way associated with Zaporozhian Host, and proved his loyalty to Peter I during the Prut campaign in 1711. Separately studied the practice of protecting the interests of hundreds government statesmen and military leaders of Russian Empire, influential courtiers and representatives of the ruling Romanov dynasty. In this context, a special official advance for the meeting of the sotnyk in Hetmanshchyna, which was provided by the service at the imperial court, including in the rank of court singers, is highlighted.

N2  - Presidential powers are stipulated in Article 102 of the Slovak Constitution (no. 460/1992 Coll.). This constitutional article defines presidential powers e.g in relation to foreign policy, the National Council, the government or the judiciary. In recent years, the use of some of these powers raised several legally relevant issues. Especially, this is the case of presidential appointive powers. Hence, in the present study, an examination of concrete appointive powers of President was done. The attention was paid to relevant decisions of Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic. The results of study show that existing concept of appointive competence of the President entails application problems, as the Constitution does not explicitly state whether it is the duty of the President to exercise the appointive competence or not. In other words, the formulation of a number of powers does not give an answer whether the Constituent Assembly had an intention to place a duty on the President to exercise his powers in a particular case or to confer a right to consider whether the President will act or not. To this day, the appointive powers of the President that have been clarified by the Constitutional Court relate only to a member of the Slovak Government, Vice-Governor of the National Bank of Slovakia, the Prosecutor General and judges of the Constitutional Court. In relation to other subjects that occupy their positions based on presidential appointment, the further procedure is legally unclear. The solution to this problem will have to be adopted in decision-making activities of the Constitutional Court, or the National Council.

N2  - The development of democracy arising from the people’s need to participate more effectively in public debate, and to have a better control of governing authority’s actions, has led legal practitioners and scholars to be interested in lobbying. The growing importance of this practice raises the question of its legal boundaries. The exercise of lobbying comprises various practices accomplished by diverse organisms and can be defined as follows: an influential action, motivated by particular, category-specific and divisive interests which are brought to the attention of a particular public officer or a producing branch of imperative legal rules without any counterpart. The aim of this practice is to obtain from the author of the act a legal effect, compatible with the interest defended by the lobbyist. Otherwise put/stated, the lobbyist solicits an administrative or a legal protection for certain particular interests. It neither binds nor commits. A lobbyist can only suggest, or propose, without any compensation. Indeed, any such counterpart would imply either imperative instruction, if the coercion was used on a representative, or corruption or conflict of interest. Concerning public interest, lobbying appears to be partial or biased, whereas it is addressing an authority whose duty is to be impartial. In spite of this apparent contradiction, lobbying has, without a doubt, an essential educational role to play towards public authorities. Therefore, if it is not limited by an ‘Exemplary State’,it will extend very closely and unintelligibly into conflicts of interests in their most accomplished form: corruption.

N2  - In low- And middle-income democracies, social groups loosely classified as poor are typically in the majority, but their political participation seldom influences national policy. There are many explanations for this. Some are familiar: The malfunctioning of democratic institutions in these countries, the class bases of liberal (bourgeois) democracy itself, and Olsonian obstacles to collective action such as the free-rider problem. The fragmentation and "localism" of most organizations representing the poor, considered by some polycentrists (see chap. 1) to be the carriers of radical (direct) democracy, is a less familiar but growing concern. The concern stems from an apparent paradox. Widespread adoption of formal democratic institutions and marked increase in civil society activism in the last two decades have coincided with a decline in the state's responsiveness to social claims and the adoption of marketizing economic policies, which have produced increasing inequality and few visible signs of poverty reduction.1 Scholars such as Castells (1996-98) and Roberts (1998) find that the community groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and other civic groups that have proliferated during this period "are often isolated and disconnected from each other, in part because of their insistence on political autonomy; and they generally focus on immediate, particularistic needs or partial demands that do not have generalized appeal" (70-71). These localized forms of organization are, as a result, unable to challenge dominant structures of power and influence state behavior. Fragmentation and "localism" have become particularly salient concerns because of the apparent decline of organized labor-the historic carrier of broad social rights-in many middle-income countries: The weakness of party systems in many Third Wave democracies, which offers little opportunity to the poor for interest aggregation and representation; and the inability of transnational networks of activists, NGOs, and social movements to pressure either national governments or international bodies into adopting significant distributive and redistributive policies Under what conditions are local organizations representing poor social groups able to coalesce into broad coalitions, and when are these coalitions able to influence national policy-making centers? One can address these questions in different ways. In chapter 2 of this volume, Whitehead and Gray-Molina take a long-term view and argue that the political capabilities that enabled Bolivian peasant groups to gain from the recent Popular Participation reform were constructed over a fortyyear period, in an iterative cycle of pro-poor policy-making and popular mobilization. They explore three such cycles and illustrate how particular types of state interventions created new opportunities for peasant groups to extend their political capabilities-that is, to "become agents in deciding, lobbying, deliberating and negotiating on pro-poor outcome." This chapter takes a different approach. It extends the polity approach set out in the introduction to this volume and, for analytic reasons, focuses on a single cycle, or episode, in what Whitehead and Gray- Molina correctly point out are iterative, path dependent sequences of state-society interactions. The chapter presents a comparative analysis of two episodes of coalition building from below that, between the mid-1980s and early 1990s, succeeded in overcoming localism and for a time acquired access to key policy-making centers. The first episode was that of the Congress for a People's Agrarian Reform (CPAR) in the Philippines, an NGO-brokered coalition of peasant organizations; the second was the women's comedores (community kitchen) movement in Peru, a coalition of communitybased kitchens in poor urban areas. The term NGO-brokered is used to highlight NGOs' central role in the emergence of the CPAR coalition without assuming direct leadership or control.2 Coalitions brokered by NGOs are of special interest because, in national contexts characterized by poorly institutionalized party systems, they have become partial "functional equivalents" of progressive parties. While CPAR was part of a foundational moment that set in motion a new sequence of state-society interactions, the comedores coalition represents at least a second episode in such a sequence. Even in the relatively brief period examined here, both the Philippines and Peru experienced profound political-institutional shifts that had substantial effects on both coalition building and efforts to shape public policy. High degrees of political-institutional flux reflect the fact that, unlike the relatively stable, high-income (Western) democracies, many low- And middle-income democracies remain marked by high levels of political conflict over the basic parameters of the political system and hence by frequent institutional change at the levels of the national political regime and state. The chapter extends the polity framework in order to capture the impact of these political-institutional shifts. It focuses on the effects national patterns of political authority-constituted by the state, the national political regime, and the political alliances that breathe life into those institutions-have on coalition building from below and on the relationship between such coalitions and political elites that produce policy influence (Houtzager 2001). Relations between coalitions and elites, the polity approach suggests, are shaped in large measure by (1) the level of intraelite conflict over the pattern of political authority, (2) the geography of state-society relations, and (3) the strength of the social bases of poor people's organizations. The task, as Epsing-Andersen (1990, 29) observes in his work on the origins of the welfare state, "is to identify salient interaction-effects" among such factors. The approach helps highlight one finding in particular. The coalitions had the most influence when they faced a relatively coherent state (with a professional bureaucracy) whose authority was broadly accepted. This allowed organizations of the poor and agents of the state to build relatively stable working relations. When state authority was heavily contested or state bureaucratization was low, wielding substantial influence was difficult if not impossible. Relatively profound political-institutional change made sustaining coalitions and access to state decision-making centers particularly difficult. One often reads and hears of the influence organizations and movements (representing whatever set of ideas, identities, or interests) wield in particular contexts. But what do we mean by influence and by policy influence in particular? Policy influence is a multidimensional concept that is, foremost, relational and has important temporal elements. It acquires analytic utility only upon some form of specification. This specification can take a variety of forms, but for the purposes of this chapter the four dimensions that Kitschelt (1986, 66-67) and Kriesi et al. (1995, chap. 9) define impose a particularly valuable analytic sharpness. The four types are as follows. • Procedural influence alters aspects of the policy-making process and includes recognition of previously excluded organizations as legitimate political actors and the opening of new political channels to those actors. • Substantive influence results in a change in policy. • Structural influence leads to the transformation of political institutions and/or national political alignments. • Sensitizing influence entails favorable alterations in either the attitude of particular actors toward a coalition's goals or in public opinion more generally. The temporal quality of influence is more difficult to address. The effects of a series of activities such as a lobbying campaign will vary over time as relations between actors in the political arena alter. Anticipating or theorizing these variable effects is, to say the least, difficult. In the Philippine case, legislation that resulted at least in part from CPARs' efforts was not implemented under one government, yet it became a cornerstone of the policies for a successor government, and for a new episode of state-society interactions, even though CPAR itself had ceased to exist. In Peru, new legislation for which the comedores fought was enacted but has yet to become practice. As the introduction to the volume points out, temporal effects will depend in part on whether an event (such as a lobbying campaign) helped initiate a new causal path, which then reproduces its impact over time, or whether it occurred as part of a process of "change within paths." In the latter case, influence will be more incremental and perhaps less visible.

N2  - Building on recent scholarship that highlights social change caused by
the Anti-Japanese War, this paper traces the politicization of women
working in the cotton mills of Chongqing, the Nationalist wartime
capital. Upon joining the workforce in the late 1930s, most cotton mill
hands were young, uneducated women expected to endure hard work and
remain physically confined to the factories. By 1945, women workers were
at the forefront of a militant labour movement, writing manifestoes and
petitioning government officials. This process of politicization stemmed
from their decision to work in factories, which breached societal norms,
and their experience of disciplined labour regimes and brutal working
conditions, which fostered an incipient class-consciousness. Moreover,
Nationalist-sponsored factory education campaigns had the unintended
effect of leading women to challenge class exploitation and sexual
discrimination. Their participation in the labour movement, which was
fuelled by their struggle for economic justice and desire for higher
social status, used both legal forms-especially petitions and letters to
the press couched in the wartime nationalist rhetoric of shared
sacrifice-and extralegal means, namely class violence. The paper
concludes that the social changes and conflict that accompanied women's
wartime work helped prepare the terrain for Communist rule.

N2  - Commerce, which outfit naturally be, among nations, as among individuals, a bond of union and friendship, has become a most fertile source of discord and animosity. Trade policy conflict among nations in the 1990s is not a relic of a waning era of economic nationalism, but a development which will actually grow in intensity as contact between national economies increases in scope and depth. A common perspective, often the favorite of economists and political scientists alike, is that most trade conflicts can be explained as rearguard actions mounted by the forces of “parochial protectionism,” a waning force in an increasingly interdependent world. A substantial portion of this work is devoted to an examination of how broad national policies and strategies emerge from the push and pull of competing bureaucracies and interest groups in the countries studied. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book. © 1992 by Taylor and Francis. All rights reserved.

N2  - The concept of ``policy advisory systems{''} was introduced by Halligan in 1995 as a way to characterize and analyze the multiple sources of policy advice utilized by governments in policy-making processes. The concept has proved useful and has influenced thinking about both the nature of policy work in different advisory venues as well as how these systems change over time. However, to date this work has examined mainly cases of developed countries and its application to developing and transitional countries is less certain. This paper sets out existing models of policy advisory systems based on Halligan's original thinking on the subject and assesses the findings of many existing studies into OECD countries that advisory systems have been changing as a result of the dual effects of increased use of external consultants and others sources of advice - ``externalization{''} - and the increased use of partisan advice inside government itself - ``politicization{''}. Determining whether or not such changes have also characterized the situations found in developing and transitional countries and at the international-domestic and state-sub-state levels is the subject of the papers in this Special Issue.

N2  - By focusing on the case of Lithuania, this paper develops a framework for understanding the development and characteristics of interest groups and the broader category of interest systems in the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe. Nearly two decades have passed since the transition to democracy in the former Baltic Soviet republics and Eastern Europe. These nations have established democratic elections, modern judicial systems, institutions of representative government and guarantees of civil rights and civil liberties. Successful democratization, however, also requires the construction of a civil society characterized by open channels of communication between citizens and interests and their governments. Recent studies of the democratization of the former Soviet republics and satellite states in Eastern Europe have rarely addressed the development and role of interest groups and lobbying in these nations. This paper fills this void by presenting the findings of the first major study of interest group politics and lobbying in Lithuania. The major findings are based upon interviews of nearly 50 Lithuanian political, academic, bureaucratic and media elites conducted in the July of 2005. Overall, the lobbying community in Lithuania is underdeveloped, often corrupt, and is negatively perceived by many Lithuanians elites. Much of this is due to the legacy of communism which heavily influences the perception and efficacy of interest groups and lobbying resulting in a suspicion among the public and government officials that has impeded the development of an effective lobbying community. Lithuanian interestgroups do not use sophisticated practices or tactics of lobbying; access is largely based on personal connections and corrupt practices. The business community is the most effective lobby due to its contacts and extensive resources; in contrast, the labour lobby is weak due to a bangover from communist times. Looking to the future development of the Lithuanian lobbying community, it is unclear what effect the entry of Lithuania into the European Union (May 2004) will have on the development of interest group activities and lobbying.

This book reconciles the apparent contradiction between political understandings of bureaucracy, in which interest groups and elected officials shape how the law is enforced, with accounts in public administration and elsewhere about the neutral and consistent implementation of the law. It shows that bureaucracies can pursue a strategy of 'strategic neutrality' to build political support, therefore demonstrating that neutrality can persist in the face of external pressures and has political origins.

N2  - In his surprise election as president, Donald Trump enjoyed disproportionate electoral support from older voters, many of whom saw in Trump a person who would work to reverse demographic, economic, and cultural forces that had transformed American life as they had long seen it. Yet, Trump’s campaign and incumbency has also been very much about gutting the Washington policy establishment of officials, bureaucrats, and lobbyists (aka, “the swamp”) which, for more than half a century, has been instrumental in enacting and expanding legislation that has benefitted older Americans far more than any other social policy constituency in the country. This article contrasts the value-oriented electoral support Trump enjoyed from older Americans with their interest concerns centered on policies such as the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and a host of smaller grant-in-aid programs. It then reviews the strong institutional base seniors and their advocates have in Washington, posing whether interest-oriented concerns may outweigh ideological ones as policy options emerge from a Republican-controlled government prior to the 2018 elections. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - The South African Constitution entrenches the achievement of equality as a founding value and the full and equal enjoyment of all rights and freedoms as a right and prohibits discrimination based on both sex and gender. Feminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation and oppression and to end all forms of gender discrimination. The Constitution, at its core, therefore embodies a feminist ideology. This has implications for the interpretation and application of all law and policy, including s 174 of the Constitution which requires the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) to consider `the need for the judiciary to reflect broadly the racial and gender composition of South Africa when judicial officers are appointed'. Broadly, the JSC's conduct between 1994 and 2014 evidences a failure to understand both gender and its constitutional mandate in terms of s 174 to proactively pursue the appointment of both female and feminist judges. Attempts to appoint more women, absent an appropriate understanding of gender, have resulted in both subtle and overt discrimination against female candidates for judicial selection. In order to remedy its misguided approach and fulfil its mandate the JSC must produce detailed guidelines on its approach to gender transformation of the judiciary, grounded in a feminist understanding of the Constitution. A unified feminist movement which embraces South Africa's feminist Constitution, with the support of a broad coalition of human rights advocacy groups and activist organisations, is urgently needed to guide the JSC in its understanding of feminism and gender, but also to hold the JSC to account when it betrays this mandate. Women are not a proxy for feminism; the South African judiciary is in dire need of a more feminist face.

N2  - Purpose: This paper aims to examine accountability arrangements in Bangladesh and to identify strengths and weaknesses, as well as potentials for improvement. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on review and analysis of published documents and data and information obtained on field visits to Bangladesh. Findings: The administrative system in Bangladesh is driven by complex rules and procedures with weak institutional support. Internal mechanisms of accountability in administrative organizations have become ineffective due to existing political, economic and social conditions. Therefore, the external mechanisms of accountability must be strengthened to ensure good governance in Bangladesh. Social implications: A weak system of accountability renders the task of public management difficult and the establishment of good governance unattainable. Improvements in social conditions can be expected with the strengthening of accountability mechanisms. Originality/value: The value of this paper lies in the identification of factors such as institutional disharmony, politicization and corruption as the most formidable barriers to accountability and good governance in Bangladesh. It presents a fresh analysis of the factors and points to the potentials for improvement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

N2  - Leading administrative reforms is the role of the political executive with a broad vision aimed at effecting improvements for the society and serving the public interest. This is a desirable arrangement that unfortunately has not been attained in Bangladesh for a number of reasons. Using various strategies, the bureaucratic leadership has exercised control over the conception, design and formulation of reform plans, and implemented recommendations selectively to uphold their own group interests. Based on a review of the existing literature, current debates, published analyses, relevant government documents, and conversations with public officials and political leaders, this article argues that administrative reforms in Bangladesh have failed to attain their objectives due to the domination of bureaucratic interests over the public interest. The experience highlights the importance of ensuring checks and balances over the roles and influence of bureaucratic leadership in the design and implementation of meaningful administrative reforms.

N2  - Achievement of the goals of social and economic development and the modernization of the governance process require the establishment of mechanisms for more effective management of relations between business and the state. The article theoretically analyzes the necessity of making changes in decision-making process on regulating entrepreneurship during the reforms in the state governance model. Directions of relationships between civil servants and entrepreneurs, mechanisms of conflict of interests have been clarified. Various approaches to the degree of involvement of entrepreneurs, civil servants and political leaders in decision making affecting entrepreneurial activity, the stages of sequencing the decision-making process, and the opportunities and freedoms granted to civil servants in the decision-making process has been analyzed. The role of human factor in decision-making process, the requirements of the administrative management apparatus, the existing problems in assessing the implementation of decisions has been explained, the systematic approach and the difficulties encountered in the use of situational analysis methods have been indicated. The complexity of grouping existing attitudes and relationships in various structures of the administrative management system, the effects of decisions and goals of the sub-divisions in public bodies on the decision and purpose of the overall state, and the shortcomings that arise during the execution have been identified. In the research process, attention was paid to the experience of different developed countries, comparative analysis, logical summarization and grouping, synthesis methods have been used. Recommendations on improving effectiveness in public administration were put forward, practical proposals were made regarding the preparation, acceptance, implementation and monitoring of enforcement of decisions within the competence of state bodies belonging to the civil service system.

N2  - Research in public administration and public policy is remarkably split between institutional approaches and policy analytical approaches. Whereas institutional approaches, most often in (comparative) public administration, identify features of politico-administrative systems to account for policy-making such as politicization or the role of the centre, policy perspectives explain policy-making by factors related to the respective policy domain, e.g. frames or agenda-setting. This divide becomes crucial in the analysis of policy advice. On the one hand, advisory systems are affected by features of politico-administrative systems because bureaucrats represent important sources of advice to ministers. On theother hand, advisory systems also vary across policy domains. The paper aims to reconcile the two approaches by analyzing the constitution of policy advisory systems as affected by both institutional and policy factors. The article argues that the composition and role of advisory systems and their components basically depend upon how the problem structure of a given policy domain prompts the involved actors to use the institutional context to impose their specific problem perception, and hence to determine the relevant knowledge in policy advice. Hence, the paper focuses on the question which institutional and policy-level factors affect the constitution of the policy advisory system in climate policy-making in German federal government. © 2013 Thurid Hustedt.

N2  - Ministerial advisers are said to strengthen the political control of bureaucracy. Using a comparative case design, this article investigates this claim by studying the roles of ministerial advisers in government coordination in Denmark and Sweden. The article demonstrates how the roles of advisers differ in coordination: Swedish advisers directly control government coordination through hierarchical authority. The roles of advisers and bureaucrats are functionally differentiated in coordination. In contrast, Danish advisers play a more indirect role in coordination. Rather than controlling coordination, they serve to reproduce the functional politicization of the permanent bureaucracy in government coordination. The findings underline the relevance of including advisers in the future study of government coordination. The analysis is based on 48 interviews with advisers and top civil servants in Denmark and Sweden.

N2  - Neutrality has traditionally been considered a key trait of the civil service in Western democracies. The conception of the neutral bureaucracy is closely linked to the notion of the prominent politics administration dichotomy of the two spheres of politics and administration, as advocated by Max Weber (1980) and Woodrow Wilson (1887). According to conventional wisdom, the firm and encompassing implementation of the merit principle realises the idea of a neutral bureaucracy. In that respect, neutrality and merit-based recruitments are often considered the opposite of politicisation. Conventionally, a neutral bureaucracy is considered to assure competence and immunity against opportunistic ideas brought in by volatile, sometimes erratic political leadership. Because elected politicians come and go with elections, they cannot ensure that political decisions are carried out based on the ‘best’ available knowledge. In that sense, bureaucrats are conceived as neutral, obedient servants that subordinate their behaviour to the will of political masters, to the law and the common good. However, there is no strict politics administration dichotomy in contemporary politico-administrative systems. Empirical findings from the late 1970s onwards demonstrated that bureaucrats are by no means as neutral and ‘apolitical’ as assumed, but rather remarkably involved in political processes. This chapter discusses the literature on neutral competence and presents an empirical analysis of Danish and British civil servants’ accounts of neutrality. This chapter concludes by suggesting the concept of competent neutrality and discussing implications for our understanding of bureaucratic neutrality.

N2  - Ministers increasingly rely on advisers for support and advice. In many
countries, these political aides are labelled differently. Generally,
they serve as close confidants to their political masters and operate in
the `shadowland' between politics and bureaucracy. Scholarship has
dragged the ministerial advisers out of the dark and described their
background and functions. Still, the field of scholarship has a
Westminster bias, is characterized by single case studies, and remains
under-theorized. The lack of comparative focus and theoretical
underpinnings can be explained by the complex nature of ministerial
advisers. This introductory article suggests a definition for
ministerial advisers and reviews the extant literature on these
important actors. The main argument is that the extent and relevance of
ministerial advisers in executive government merits integration into
mainstream public administration and political science theory and
research.

N2  - Although politicization is a perennial research topic in public administration to investigate relationships between ministers and civil servants, the concept still lacks clarification. This article contributes to this literature by systematically identifying different conceptualizations of politicization and suggests a typology including three politicization mechanisms to strengthen the political responsiveness of the ministerial bureaucracy: formal, functional and administrative politicization. The typology is empirically validated through a comparative case analysis of politicization mechanisms in Germany, Belgium, the UK and Denmark. The empirical analysis further refines the general idea of Western democracies becoming ‘simply’ more politicized, by illustrating how some politicization mechanisms do not continue to increase, but stabilize – at least for the time being.

N2  - This article explores the under-representation of women at the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) levels of Western Australian (WA) local government. It draws on data collected from 21 second tier senior women managers about their perceptions and experiences of leadership within the sector, as well as their aspirations for CEO appointment. By applying critical gender analysis to the data, gender and specifically masculinity emerges as a significant and valued leadership attribute. While this analysis is not unique to local government, what sets the sector apart is its apparent disinterest in examining the reasons for, or the impacts of this continued leadership stereotype when at the same time Australian public and private institutions are challenging these traditional leadership models. This article points to fundamental weaknesses in the formal power structures and processes of local government that support deeply embedded biases about leadership. Perhaps the most significant contributor to these outcomes that emerged from the study is the apparent unencumbered power of Mayors and elected members over all aspects of CEO employment, especially recruitment.

N2  - This article focusses on leadership in local government and the attributes valued in a CEO. It draws on a series of interviews with both Mayors/Shire Presidents and incumbent CEOs undertaken as the local government sector is faced with a number of complex challenges that is expanding the traditional role and responsibilities from the regulated organisational delivery of rates, roads, and rubbish', to one that is involved in long-term more market-driven delivery of a diverse range of services. The analysis raises the question as to whether both political and organisational leaders have fully understood the impact of the changing sector, and the consequential type of organisational leadership required. Further, the article argues that long established formal power structures and processes of local government and specifically the apparent unencumbered power of Mayors and elected members over all aspects of CEO employment, especially recruitment, may in fact compromise leadership appointments and organisational performance. This article reports on a study that investigates what elected and appointed officials believe are necessary attributes for appointment to the role of local government CEO and the processes used to recruit suitable candidates. The findings highlight two distinct types of leadership that reflect very different concepts of local government.

N2  - This paper analyzes the impact of centralization process of presidential political power during the last decade (2003-2015) on human resources management policies within the National Public Administration. This period of systematic concentration of powers in the hands of the president was accompanied by a progressive expansion of nomination capacities in order to guarantee the political adherence of the bureaucracy to the official project. The flexibilization of designations was the main resource used by governments to ensure political leadership over bureaucracy. The presidents mainly resorted to two appointment strategies to spread their margin of discretion: (1) the extension of the structure of transitional hiring outside the career system; and (2) the colonization of hierarchical positions through exception. The increasing use of these flexible mechanisms contributed to limit the full institutionalization of a professional bureaucracy, negatively affecting both the size of the state apparatus and government performance.

N2  - What explains Members of European Parliament's (MEPs’) decisions to recognize some interest groups as relevant policy actors? Addressing this question is fundamental for understanding the role of political elites in shaping patterns of interest representation and interest groups’ role in legislative decision making. Building on theories of legislative behaviour and informational theories of legislative lobbying, we argue that MEPs give recognition to those organizations that are instrumental for achieving key political goals: re-election, career-progression and policy influence. The pursuit of these goals generates different patterns of MEP recognition of interest groups. We contribute to the literature in three ways. Conceptually, we propose interest group recognition as a key concept for understanding interactions and links between legislative and non-legislative actors. We illustrate the high conceptual relevance of recognition for interest groups research while noting its conspicuous neglect in the literature. We address this gap and place the concept central stage in understanding legislators’ attention to and behaviour towards interest organizations. Theoretically, we build on a classic framework explaining legislators’ behaviour and refine it through the lenses of informational theories of legislative lobbying. We argue and show that legislators recognize organizations that enhance electoral prospects in their home Member States, and that legislator–group ideological proximity and an interest group's prominence in a specific policy field affect MEPs’ decisions to recognize some organizations as relevant actors. Our argument acknowledges the importance of the broader context in which MEPs operate and pays attention to how they react to and interact with it. Empirically, we propose an original and innovative research design to identify and measure recognition with the help of social media data. Our measurement strategy constitutes a significant improvement insofar that it reduces the challenges of measurement bias usually associated with self-reported data generated through interviews, surveys, or the textual analysis of newspaper articles and official documents. Our research design allows using fine-grained measures of key dependent and explanatory variables and offers the very first analysis of MEP interest group recognition that holds across decision-making events and policy areas. We test our argument on a new dataset with 4 million observations recording the recognition of more than 7,000 organizations by 80 per cent of MEPs serving in EP8. We find that MEPs are more likely to recognize organizations from their Member State, particularly under flexible- and open-list electoral institutions. MEPs are also more likely to recognize organizations that share their ideological affinities and are prominent actors in policy areas legislators specialize in.

N2  - The relevance of the problem under study is conditioned by the need to explore the bureaucracy of district schools in Kazan province during the first half of the 19th century, making it possible to determine the contribution of these officials to the development of public education. The article presents the conditions for implementing professional activities by staff caretakers and the analysis of staff caretaker's duties and their financial competence, and the specifics of their position as civil servants in the public education system. The authors showed that the practical activity of the district schools, their financial well-being (in the form of additional contributions), and the management of the schools' entire economic part, reportedly, depended on the personal qualities, abilities, and skills of a regular caretaker. The article examines conflict situations between teachers of district schools, which became a characteristic phenomenon for the entire educational system in the first half of the 19th century. The methods of their elimination by staff caretakers were also considered. Determination of the factors for establishing a staff caretaker institution and the principles of appointment to this position made it possible to identify this role in organizing the system of district schools in Kazan province during the first half of the 19th century. The authors showed that the staff caretakers controlled almost all the activities of the Kazan province's district schools during the first half of the 19th century, reporting, if necessary, about the shortcomings in their work to higher authorities.

N2  - Poor bureaucratization in prismatic (transitional) societies is attributed to malintegration of the ideal bureaucratic principles with subsisting traditional sociocultural features by Fred Riggs. Riggs has been severely criticized on many fronts, yet aspects of his theory remain relevant towards explaining persistent poor administrative behaviour in most African countries. This article applies Riggs' notion of poly-communalism and poly-normativism to explain the contribution of low state identity to persistent poor administrative behaviour in Africa. Historical institutionalism theory is also used to attempt at resolving the challenge of equilibrium for which Riggs' theory is commonly criticized. The author avers that communalism, a value that supports group interest in a traditional society, subsists in most poly-communal transitional African countries, leading to distortions in administrative behaviour. A good number of African countries were mobilized through colonialism but poorly assimilated, thus lacking strong common state identity, which leads to ineffective public administration. The article suggests that resolving the trapping of the administrative system in Africa requires resolving the challenge of poly-communalism and lack of common identity among a state population.

N2  - The rise of Islam Karimov President Islam Karimov initially came to office as a leader of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan in 1989. These were the years of resurgent nationalisms across the Soviet Union. Karimov, during pub lic meetings, presented himself as a leader of the whole nation who would stand above of any ‘clan’ or regional patronage network. Karimov also denounced clan politics and swore to fight and eradicate these from Uzbekistani reality. In a book that he published in 1997, Karimov listed regionalism and clans among the seven mostimportant threats to the country’s security. Karimov therefore acknowledged that the phenomenon of ‘clans’ had not disappeared after years of anti-corruption campaigns during the Soviet period (1997: 59). What Karimov did not add was that, as a politician and head of the state, he was himself the product of ‘clan’ politics. During his brief tenure as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan, Karimov established himself as a leader capable of meeting the expectations and hopes of various informal elite factions in the pursuit of key negotiations with Moscow. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Karimov’s election to the presidency, his government gained control over the most important economic resources, including cotton, precious and non-ferrous metals and other minerals. Once independence was proclaimed, Karimov also presided over the rehabilitation of Sharaf Rashidov and the amnesty of dozens of other government officials and regional elites who had been arrested and jailed in connection with Moscow’s anti-corruption cam paigns in the middle and late 1980s (Carlisle 1995). A number of local officials associated with Sharaf Rashiov and his patronage networks were also granted key positions in the government. This was the case for Shukrullo Mirsaidov and Timur Alimov, two key members of the Tashkent ŉetwork’, who respectively became Prime Minister and Presidential Adviser; Ismail Jurabekov who repres ented the Samarkand-Jizzak region was also appointed Deputy Prime Minister, a position that involved control over water management and agriculture. Karimov, how ever, soon distanced himself from factional groups and even assumed the posture of a referee, as Moscow used to do. This enabled him to manipulate inter-factional rivalries so as to promote a ‘divide-and-rule’ strategy. As he strengthened his grip over power, Karimov’s dependency on previous allies and partners loosened. Karimov, how ever, did not use this opportunity to build and enforce democratic and legal institutions that would have curbed the spread of neopatrimonialism. He strengthened instead his personal rule through neopatrimonial practices and by playing factions off one another. The outcome was a kind of check-and-balance system that remained, how ever, limited to the sphere of informal relationships within the executive government. The elimination of old ‘clan’ leaders was supplemented by limitations installed on the capacity of local elites to get access to the profitable mining and cotton sectors (Ilkhamov 2004: 1). Step by step, major export resources became concentrated in the hands of the central government and fell under the personal supervision of Karimov. The seizure of major national resources went along with the preservation of a command economy. The introduction of elements of free market in the economy remained limited and highly selective. As had been the case during the Soviet period, the planned economy and the monopoly exercised over power by a single political grouping created a favourable turf for the re-emergence of ‘clan’ formations and inter-clan rivalries. So as to diminish the sway of regional leaders, Karimov adopted a pol icy of frequent rotations of the regional hokims (governors), ousted from their posts every three years on average as estimated for the period between 1993 and 2002 (Ilkhamov 2004: 170). The reason invoked for these dismissals was usually the corruption of the office holders. In a number of cases, dismissals were also followed by criminal charges brought against the ousted hokim. Despite the frequent occurrence of these corruption charges, nothing was done to reform the system and reduce the opportunities for abuse of power among local governors. The regional hokims kept being appointed by the President himself and were employed to strengthen the repressive apparatus and surveillance over local governments, institutions and population. What such a policy also achieved was a reduction of the likelihood of conspiracies plotted by local hokims against Karimov himself - who also happened to have been one of them in the past. Minimizing the risk of conspiracy by the local hokims coincided with the rise of influence of a new type of patronage networks within key ministries in the central government. Structures responsible for security, law enforcement, tax collection, custom, finances and export procurement became particularly powerful. Thus, fierce competition grew between the Interior Ministry and the National Security Services, a rivalry tacitly encouraged by the President, as part of the same check-and-balance system. The power of these two administrations stemmed from wielding almost unchecked coercive power, as much as from the acquisition of considerable economic power. Much of this was achieved by gaining informal control over spheres of economic activity that range from export trade, retail and catering businesses to drug trafficking. This pattern still remains unchecked today, perhaps because President Karimov sees it as a retribution for loyalty and an opportunity to keep the respective patronage leaders on leash by threatening them to the use of compromising evidence collected while tracing their corrupt deeds. Law enforcement agencies have also actively contributed to the enrichment of the presidential family. Building familial wealth has become quite an extensive business, resulting in the emergence of what may be described as a kind of ‘mega-clan’, centred on the Presidential family. Usage of this term to de scribe a phenomenon observed in several other post-Soviet authoritarian regimes, enables to stress the existence of a hierarchy that combines personal rule and patronage through access to administrative structures and support from other resource affluent ‘clans’. Karimov’s daughter, Gulnara Karimova, until recent times was considered as one of most probable candidates to his succession. She also played a key role in the creation and expansion of this ‘mega-clan’. From the late 1990s onwards, the growth of Gulnara Karimova’s business empire was spectacular, both in terms of economic might and political clout. Thanks to the support of her father, and backing up from the administrative apparatus of law enforcement and the security agencies as well as some ‘clan’ groupings, business structures reportedly associated with Gulnara Karimova acquired one asset after another. Early in 2011, she featured among the 300 richest people in Switzerland where her assets were estimated around US$600 million.8 This ‘mega-clan’ phenomenon highlights a key distinction between Karimov style of neopatrimonial rule and Stalin’s. Unlike Stalin, Karimov has, like other post-Soviet rulers, embraced the market economy, albeit in a very selective and ‘kleptocratic’ manner. He clearly had little concern for the egalitarian ideals which were putting certain limits to the egoistic aspirations of office holders in Soviet times. This also gives a clue to the specific slant of Karimov’s neopatrimonial rule, namely the combination of two mutually supportive factors, namely the hyper-centralization of the administrative system due to exceptional control of power as sumed by the President, and, secondly, the selective adoption of market economy and its institutions so as to allow the ruling elite to legalize its capture of resources and capital. This mix between monopolistic patterns of political control and elements of market economy is the hallmark of Uzbekistan’s brand of neopatrimonialism. Such a pattern, needless to say, represents one of major obstacle to the economic, political and institutional development of the country. © 2012 Selection and editorial matter, Daniel C.

article situates the emergence of the Deoband movement, an Islamic
revivalist movement based at India's Dar al-'Ulum Deoband madrasa
(seminary), within concepts of colonial secularity in British India. It
shows how the decline of first Mughal and then British patronage for
Islamic learning, as well as the post 1857 British policy of
non-interference in `religious' matters, opened up a space for Deobandi
scholars to re-conceive the madrasa as a `religious' institution rather
than one engaged in the production of civil servants, to reimagine the
`ulama as stewards of public morality rather than professionals in the
service of the state, and to reframe the knowledge they purveyed as
`religious' knowledge distinct from the `useful' secular knowledge
promoted by the British. The article treats this production of
`religious' knowledge and space as discourse of distinction similar to
those explored elsewhere in this HSR Special Issue.

N2  - The HiPPS was developed by the Office of the Civil Service Commission (OCSC). The aim of HiPPS was to prepare the Thai government officers with high performance and potential to develop and learn through the workplace as continual learning. The objectives of this research were 1) to evaluate the success in the HiPPS administration of the government departments, 2) to compare the opinions of the five sample groups about the success factors in the HiPPS administration, and 3) to investigate the problems in the use of HiPPS. The data were collected from five groups, 694 total samples from 42 government departments. The instruments were five rating-scale (1-5 level) questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and focus group interviews. Data was analyzed by ANOVA and the content analysis. The results indicated that overall, the average HiPPS administration of the government departments were fairly strength level in grade B (X- = 3.37). In the comparison among the opinions of the five sample groups about the success factors: Context, Input, Process, Product, Outcome, and Impact, there were also statistically significant differences at. 01 (F=19.536 **, 13.010 **, 22.143 **, 6.493 **, 28.010 **, and 6.211 ** respectively). Finally, the most found problems in HiPPS administration were as follows: lacking of cooperation from executives, existence of patronage system, lacking of definite HiPPS responsible unit, frequent change in HiPPS committee, incompetency of human resource management, negative attitude of increasing workload of the officers responsible for HiPPS.

N2  - Social changes, associated shifts in police work, and cultural variations raise interesting questions about the ideal police applicant. These issues were explored by investigating key `suitability' criteria for applicants to join the Swedish National Police and the Catalan Police in Spain. First, criteria and selection procedures in official documents were examined. Next, focus group sessions were carried out with selection practitioners about different criteria. Results indicate several similarities between the organizations in formal criteria and selection procedures, notably an emphasis on peace-making and problem-solving abilities. However, differences were found in areas such as loyalty towards the organization and differences that correspond to different organizational images. The views from the selection practitioners mostly align with the official documents but different outcomes are possible due to different interpretations of how a given construct should manifest itself in actual performance. Practical implications from this study could prove valuable for improving selection practices.

N2  - Powerful corporations leverage the law to shape the regulatory environments in which they operate. A key strategy for achieving this is litigation. I ask under what conditions corporations litigate, and specifically, what happens when two repeat players, transnational agribusiness firms and local governments, face each other in court. I compare outcomes of two cases-Hawaii and Arica, Chile-documenting how different sociopolitical contexts and legal systems shape how actors engage the law. Interviews with firm managers, unions, government officials, lawyers, and advocacy organization leaders and document analysis reveal that firms seize on existing institutional norms and politics to define their localized legal strategies. Through strategic legalism, a defensive legal strategy that is outcome-oriented and context-specific, firms accomplish legal compliance and political containment of their opposition. In Hawaii, firms rely on preemptive legality, a strategy that moves controversial issues like pesticide safety from one domain of democratic politics to another that is largely incontestable because it is preempted by a higher authority. In Chile, firms use authoritarian legality, an approach that draws on authoritarian structures and policies within the state, to sway legal outcomes. These cases reveal the mechanisms that corporations draw on to institutionalize their power advantages through the law, offering a typology for future scholars to better understand how the strategic behavior of corporations shapes regulatory outcomes.

N2  - This study explored the role and responsibility of elected officials including political actors and addressed the factors of politics, decentralisation, bureaucratic management, and political commitment to understanding accountability in health service delivery. This study used qualitative case studies for which a total of 68 in-depth interviews and five focus group discussions were conducted in two areas of rural and urban Bangladesh. The findings show that political actors have poor commitment to improving accountability and healthcare delivery. The elected officials are not interested in organising regular meetings and they are even reluctant to organise a health service committee to make health officials accountable. The opposition political parties have no participation in health service organisations as the existing political culture does not allow it. Moreover, elected officials have a limited administrative authority because of an inadequate decentralised health system that leads to poor accountability and inadequate healthcare delivery. Further, bureaucrats want to capture power and are unwilling to decentralise the health system. The policy recommendation includes the decentralisation of healthcare provision and increased participation of elected representatives in a decentralised system.

N2  - Scholars of street-level bureaucracy and institutional research focus primarily on the relationships between advocates and their larger bureaucratic and social systems, assuming that advocates have little need to satisfy their beneficiaries. We find otherwise in our two-year ethnographic study of public defenders advocating for disadvantaged clients in interactions with district attorneys. In our analysis of 82 advocacy opportunities, we demonstrate that, when existing bureaucratic and social systems put beneficiaries at a disadvantage, advocates may be concerned about managing fraught relationships with their beneficiaries in addition to navigating barriers within the bureaucratic and social systems. We further show a tension between the two; ironically, engaging in advocacy work on behalf of beneficiaries can lead to beneficiary mistrust. As a result, advocates engage in triadic advocacy work-managing impressions with their beneficiaries while also influencing powerful actors within the system on behalf of these same beneficiaries. Understanding the process by which advocates navigate this tension is critical to understanding benefi-ciary outcomes. By reconceptualizing advocacy work as a triadic process among advocate, bureaucratic system, and beneficiary rather than as a dyadic process between advocate and bureaucratic system, this paper develops new theory about how advocates can attempt to garner benefits that advance the rights and opportunities of the disadvantaged.

Through extensive literature review and empirical research, the authors conclude that the independence, efficiency and effectiveness of the PSC largely depend on the politics-administration relationship. Furthermore, this relationship is affected by regime types and it regulates the optimum functioning or malfunctioning of the institution. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

N2  - This chapter analyses patronage in contemporary Portugal. First, it provides a precise conceptualization of patronage and, second, bases its assessment on a detailed empirical basis which makes it comparable to the other cases analysed in this book. Third, and related, this chapter further specifies the dependent variable of patronage. The departure point is a neo-institutional one, that the nature of patronage in Portugal is unlikely to remain unaffected by changes in the country's institutional context. As such, it assesses not only the practice of patronage but also its scope, logic, and style, in order to better understand how democratization, the evolving nature of the Portuguese state and bureaucracy, as well as its parties and party system dynamics, have potentially impacted on the nature of patronage in Portugal.

N2  - Although German bureaucracy is typically categorised as Weberian, a clear distinction between politics and administration has never been a defining characteristic of the German political-administrative system. Many close interrelations and interactions between elected politicians and appointed civil servants can be observed at all levels of administration. Higher-ranking civil servants in Germany are used to and generally appreciate the functional politicisation of their jobs, that is their close involvement in all stages of the policy process, from policy formation, goal definition, negotiation within and outside government to the implementation and evaluation of policies. For top positions, therefore, a class of ‘political civil servants’ is a special feature of the German system, and obtaining ‘political craft’ has become an important part of the learning and job experience of higher-ranking civil servants.

N2  - Scholars focus on interstate competition and intrastate economic conditions as the primary determinants of state economic development policies, including direct subsidies. New data from the Good Jobs First Subsidy Tracker illustrates large differences in subsidy spending across the states and that established firms are the disproportionate beneficiaries. In light of this new evidence, we argue that the political presence of the business sector within the state is an important determinant of state subsidy spending. A large political presence helps forward industry interests before government and has the potential to capture state governments. We find support for the cultural capture model by demonstrating that a greater number of lobbyists and campaign contributions from businesses leads to more subsidy spending, all else equal. We conclude that subsidies, and which companies receive them, are a product of both politics and economics.

N2  - Fragmentation of forest policy at the EU level and image problems of the forest industry have increased forest sector actors' interest for cooperation on and coordination of communication activities. Although internal communication in the forest sector at the European level is generally well developed both formally and informally, the desired strengthening of communication with other sectors and the public at large is perceived as difficult. In this pre-study 39 interviews were conducted with EU and UNECE/FAO officials, EU level Forest-based Industries and forestry sector federation representatives, and forest scientists working at the European level. The results indicate that EU level forest sector core actors' ideas on communication differ. Ideas range from strictly image improvement; being more successful at lobbying with other sectors and high-level policy-makers; up to building long-lasting relations and two-way communication processes with other sectors. This makes it difficult to come to coordinated action among forest sector actors. A more active exchange of information on best practices in forest communication between national as well as European level actors, and increased coordination of communication efforts is desired by industry, forest owners as well as policy-makers. However, clear ideas on how to improve, especially inter-sectoral, communication are largely lacking.

N2  - While the Arab uprisings have overturned the idea of Arab “exceptionalism,” or the acceptance of authoritarianism, better analysis of authoritarianism's resilience in pre- and post-uprising scenarios is still needed. Modern Middle East Authoritarianism: Roots, Ramifications, and Crisis undertakes this task by addressing not only the mechanisms that allowed Middle Eastern regimes to survive and adapt for decades, but also the obstacles that certain countries face in their current transition to democracy.
This volume analyzes the role of ruling elites, Islamists, and others, as well as variables such as bureaucracy, patronage, the strength of security apparatuses, and ideological legitimacy to ascertain regimes’ life expectancies and these factors’ post-uprisings repercussions. Discussing not only the paradigms through which the region has been analyzed, but also providing in-depth case studies of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran, the authors arrive at critical conclusions about dictatorship and possibilities for its transformation.
Employing diverse research methods, including interviews, participant observation, and theoretical discussions of authoritarianism and political transition, this book is essential reading for scholars of Middle East Studies, Islamic Studies and those with an interest in the governance and politics of the Middle East. © 2014 Noureddine Jebnoun, Mehrdad Kia and Mimi Kirk.

N2  - There is a wealth of research into time series dynamics of bureaucratic control in the federal presidential system of the US, but no equivalent investigation in unitary parliamentary systems. This article proposes an approach for measurement of the effect of political interventions on bureaucratic outputs in British politics. It throws some light on tools of bureaucratic control that are associated with the fusion of legislative and executive powers in Britain's Westminster system. In contrast to the US, political control in the form of oversight or appointments is not required because government is able to intervene directly in bureaucratic activities through legislative, executive and administrative controls. It uses Box-Tiao time series models to analyse administration of the UK asylum system by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office.

N2  - Literature on comparative institutions shows that electoral and constitutional rules affect the behavior of politicians, while the literature on political control of bureaucracies demonstrates how politicians exercise control over bureaucracies and affect their performance. This article explores how electoral rules affect bureaucratic effectiveness. In particular, I hypothesize that personal vote-seeking incentives drive legislators to specialize in legislative committees to develop their personal reputations. Once legislators specialize in legislative committees, they are in a better position to increase bureaucratic effectiveness. Drawing on the World Bank index of bureaucratic effectiveness, this article finds significant associations between the personal vote-seeking incentive, legislative specialization, and bureaucratic effectiveness. However, these associations are restricted to presidential systems, where the separation of powers makes legislative specialization in committees a key mechanism for effective bureaucratic oversight.

N2  - Government officials have recently been scrutinized for using information acquired in the performance of their official duties to gain market-trading advantages. Lobbyists have similarly been criticized for collecting material nonpublic political information from Capitol Hill contacts and selling it to their clients-notably hedge funds-who presumably use the information in their market transactions. Is this insider trading? Most likely not. Should it be? A few members of Congress have responded by introducing legislation in the past three Congresses that would bring trading on this "political intelligence, " by government insiders and outsiders, under the umbrella of the federal securities laws. Unsurprisingly, the legislation has failed to garner significant political support. But a renewed fervor for "cleaning up" Washington ushered in by the Obama Administration, coupled with the current economic crisis, has reinvigorated the campaign. The legislation was reintroduced and received a hearing in 2009. In addition, recent academic scholarship is now calling for the passage of this legislation in order to bring trading on political intelligence under the federal insider trading regime. This Comment takes issue with the insider trading approach. It argues that the federal securities laws are an inappropriate and ineffective legal mechanism for remedying issues of political ethics. First, as it pertains to government insiders, this Comment recommends an ethics approach, such as mandatory blind trusts, to deal with financial conflicts of interest. Second, with gard to outside actors, such as lobbyists and hedge funds, it argues for public disclosure of political-intelligence gathering activities. This Comment argues against prohibiting trading on political intelligence by outside actors because these actors are merely the Washington equivalents of market analysts, whose information gathering functions are perfectly legitimate, if not desirable. Lastly, this Comment warns that insider trading regulation of political intelligence would have two distinct chilling effects: one on democratic process, by hampering dialogue between lawmakers and constituents, and another on market efficiency, by discouraging valuable information gathering.

N2  - Context: Policymaking is a highly complex process that is often difficult to predict or influence. Most of the scholarship examining the role of research evidence in policymaking has focused narrowly on characteristics of the evidence and the interactions between scientists and government officials. The real-life context in which policymakers are situated and make decisions also is crucial to the development of evidence-informed policy. Methods: This qualitative study expands on other studies of research utilization at the state level through interviews with twenty-eight state legislators and administrators about their real-life experiences incorporating evidence into policymaking. The interviews were coded inductively into the following categories: (1) the important or controversial issue or problem being addressed, (2) the information that was used, (3) facilitators, and (4) hindrances. Findings: Hindrances to evidence-informed policymaking included institutional features; characteristics of the evidence supply, such as research quantity, quality, accessibility, and usability; and competing sources of influence, such as interest groups. The policymakers identified a number of facilitators to the use of evidence, including linking research to concrete impacts, costs, and benefits; reframing policy issues to fit the research; training to use evidence-based skills; and developing research venues and collaborative relationships in order to generate relevant evidence. Conclusions: Certain hindrances to the incorporation of research into policy, like limited budgets, are systemic and not readily altered. However, some of the barriers and facilitators of evidence-informed health policymaking are amenable to change. Policymakers could benefit from evidence-based skills training to help them identify and evaluate high-quality information. Researchers and policymakers thus could collaborate to develop networks for generating and sharing relevant evidence for policy.

N2  - Notice and comment provisions in agency rulemaking provide an important mechanism for the public to contribute to policy. Yet there is limited research on how interest groups participate in this process. California's passage of an ergonomics standard in 1997, the only current state statute in the country, provides a useful, high salience policy case for examining public commentary. Between an initially proposed comprehensive standard and the enactment of a much weaker regulation occurred the largest public response in California's state Occupational Safety and Health Administration history. Through a detailed content analysis of the notice and comment submissions we identify features of participatio n and claims-making that differ between business and nonbusiness submissions. Business groups were the large majority of participants and also presented a disproportionate amount of evidence, using an ``abstract-technical'' policy frame to assert the illegitimacy of the ergonomics standard. Labor, public health organizations and private citizens represented less than one-third of the participants and relied primarily on experiential information and a ``concretized-moral'' characterization of policy issues in support of the standard. The existence of these distinct ``interpretive communities'' that mobilize different resources raises questions about whether public commentary can fulfill its purported ``democratic accountability'' purpose as well as underline the limitations of appealing to scientific expertise for solving complex policy problems.

N2  - Existing theories of legislative delegation feature spatial models in
which a principal chooses a single agent to whom to delegate authority.
In the canonical model, the ally principle holds - the principal picks
the ideologically closest agent. However, elected politicians typically
decide whether to delegate not to an individual but to an institution,
which consists of many individuals with differing preferences. To
improve on existing work, we model delegation with bureaucratic
hierarchy. Our results show that hierarchy is sufficient to undercut the
ally principle. Indeed, capturing the logic of delegation and its
results requires incorporating agency structure, especially the costs of
an agency head controlling her subordinates resulting in incomplete
control, as different structures are associated with different policy
outcomes even when the same people constitute a bureaucracy. We also
demonstrate that integrating hierarchy has important implications for a
wide range of considerations, such as agency structural choice and the
measurement of agency ideal points.

N2  - This paper focuses on how risk management practices and decision making in a government agency are affected when a high-ranking policy network is activated during the planning process of a major road construction project. The policy network studied in this paper comprised Volvo, Ericsson, SAAB, the Gothenburg Municipal Executive Committee Chairman and the Swedish Transport Administration Director General, among others. The network worked to incorporate an experimental fifth lane on the E45 roadway. The experimental lane was presented as an investment that would create business opportunities - companies from around the world could use the E45 to test new car models, safety devices and technical and environmental measures. During the months before the experimental road lane project was terminated by the National Road Administration, road officials at the street level prepared two design plans, one with the experimental road lane and the other without the lane. The principal assignment for the officials was to initiate and make decisions on the basis of risk analysis. The four risk themes considered during the planning process were localization, road solution, publicity and legality.The experimental road lane case study demonstrates that policy networks (i.e., lobbying groups) operating within a network governance structure can negatively affect risk assessment and risk management. The groups can override procedural and expert-based decision making rules when they have access to public decision making powers at the appropriate level. In such situations, public officials responsible for risk management at the street level risk losing control and decision making power. The empirical findings stress the importance of taking measures that guarantee risk management in situations where the individuals responsible for risk management (i.e., public bureaucrats) lose authority and discretion. Deep knowledge of statutory and ethical obligations can endow officials with an enhanced ability to make high-quality public risk decisions and, thereby, advance critical infrastructure protection efforts. The study presented in this paper was inspired by network governance, implementation and decision making theories; the empirical data was collected through passive participatory observations and from interviews and relevant documents.

N2  - Do judges defer to executives with increased institutional control over the executive branch? Administrative agencies play a key role in the policy implementation process. Executives could view aggressive judicial review of executive branch activity as a threat to executive power and negatively respond to perceived judicial intrusions. Governors across the country possess varying amounts of institutional authority over the agencies that comprise their states' executive branches. For example, in many states, executive branch officials are elected by the public or appointed by someone other than the governor. Increased fragmentation increases the difficulty of centralized management and decreases gubernatorial influence over the executive branch. I examine whether state supreme courts defer more to agencies in states where governors have more formal control over the executive branch. I find that state supreme courts are more likely to rule in favor of state administrative agencies in states where the governor has increased appointment power and increased power to review agency rulemaking.

N2  - A survey of the long history of Helmand province in southern Afghanistan suggests there are common patterns in the causes of violence amongst Afghans of the region. The hypothesis of this article is that there are three broad historical factors that influence outbreaks of violence and their resolution: patronage, control of land and preservation of local autonomy. Each element is in dynamic tension, and today the character of their inter-relationship has been altered by narco-profits, foreign military intervention and Afghan Government officials seeking to maximize their local power. The prospects for the province are linked intrinsically to these elements, so that, while foreign forces aim to provide a transition to Afghan Government control and security, there is every likelihood that traditional areas of dispute will reassert themselves. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

N2  - This paper examines the nature and character of corruption and presents a general, overview and comparison of corrupt practices in,the United States and China. Neither country is corruption free but the United States has a substantially lower rate of perceived corruption than China. To understand United States corrupt practices, the focus is. on three spheres: bureaucracy, elected (political) officials, and business. The U.S. bureaucracy is generally, clean and an. historic explanation is offered as to why; for the other two spheres (U.S. elected officials and business), laws, law enforcement, public expectation, and professional standards guide transactions and control/reduce corruption. But the Chinese political context cannot be neatly separated into the three areas of bureaucracy, political officials, and economic activities. Instead, relevant Chinese activities are a blend of these categories. To understand Chinese corrupt practices, the focus is on the nature of collusive corruption, the possible ineffectiveness of severe penalties, and the more theoretical issues of the role of laws and law enforcement, and the importance of a corruption-free bureaucratic instrument.

N2  - This paper analyses the emergence of ``users{''} (usagers) of public services in speeches, structures and practices, and their consequences on civil servants' conditions of labor, especially in the PTT (Poster, Telephones and Telegraphes). French PTT tried to maintain its position in a concurrential context, in particular concerning financials products. This changed the ``public service{''} `s doctrine between 1965 and 1974 : the equality of all users in front of public services is transformed into the equality of users in the same conditions. But postmen have not waited for administrative's instructions in order to improve the service to the users, especially in financial services. Their practices had already changed. Thus, the history of the links between the State, the PTT and civil servants helps us to understand the idea of public service. Ideas and practices are constantly negociated between groups who may have divergents interests.

Providing an overview of the literature on minoritized policy advocacy, as well as highlighting the dearth of inquiry on minoritized organizations that engage in policy advocacy on behalf of and in consortium with HBCUs, this article highlights the work of the UNCF, its history, and its evolving role in policy advocacy to combat policy borne out of predominantly White policy arenas. We identify the ways UNCF challenge deficit narratives about HBCUs and the minoritized populations these institutions serve as well as offer concrete strategies and technologies of resistance that can be used for engaging in policy advocacy on behalf of minoritized organizations and communities.

N2  - On April 20, 2008, Paraguay elected rural bishop Fernando Lugo as its
president, ending the reign of the Colorado party that had ruled the
country since 1947. The election spurred a political shift to the left
and considerably transformed the relationship that the national soy
industry had forged with the state bureaucracy in previous decades.
Progressives, intellectuals, and activists became employed by the same
legal apparatus they had protested against for years. Correspondingly,
public institutions that had been partly built by the soy industry were
suddenly staffed by some of the sector's most ardent critics. In The
Government of Beans, Kregg Hetherington explores this peculiar political
juncture so as to offer wider reflections on governance in the
Anthropocene. To this end, he relies on 17 short chapters that are
grouped into three parts. Part I (Cast of Characters) presents us with
the people and plants that the book is about. Over the course of six
chapters, Hetherington historicizes the conjectures that laid the
groundwork for the emergence of soy and its politicization, guiding us
past, among others, the Stroessner dictatorship, cotton-growing
colonists, soy-growing colonists displacing the earlier cotton growers,
herbicides, Roundup Ready beans, the present-absent state, and 1990s
neoliberalization.

N2  - This analysis of Korean pension politics under the Roh Moo-hyun administration focuses on the roles and limitations of party politics and social dialogue as institutional intermediaries between the state and civil society. It suggests that the social policy reform was made through formal democratic systems but without some of the essential elements of democracy. Although each political party admitted pension problems suggested by civil society during the initial stage of agenda formation, the final decision was made through negotiations among the political parties and government bureaucracy. In making decisions, there was no room to discuss the positions of labor, capital or other social groups. The political parties did not provide a channel for civil society's positions to be reflected in National Assembly discussions. On the other hand, an attempt at social dialogue was initiated by the new ruling elite. Although various interest groups displayed the possibility of agreement, the process of social dialogue was stopped by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Even after democratization, bureaucracy affected party politics and dominated social dialogue as Korean pension politics lacked institutional communication between the state and civil society.

N2  - A unique opportunity for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and advocates to contribute to the development of a human rights-based response to the trafficking of human beings now exists. Many governments have signed a new international treaty on trafficking and are in the process of adopting domestic anti-trafficking laws. However, as explained in this article, most government officials are uninformed about the causes and consequences of trafficking, and the appropriate rights-based legal responses. NGOs can bring their expertise and a human rights framework to the debate by working with government officials to draft and implement new trafficking laws and policies. This article offers a brief introduction and guidance to some of the challenges that NGOs will face in their advocacy work.

N2  - The importance of patronage and cronyism in hierarchical work relations among government officials is well known. At the crossroads of the history of institutions and administrative practices and personnel, the present study elucidates the special characteristics of institutional patronage and cronyism and explores the role they play in work relations. In the first part, the author makes reference to work relations specific to Muscovite chancelleries (prikazy) at the end of the seventeenth century; then, she evokes the main measures of Peter I's reform of central government agencies and points to what impact on hierarchical work relations the reformer expected them to have; lastly, she analyses the reasons for and effects of the opposition of certain senior officials to these measures. The second part deals with the period between 1725 and the 1780s and reveals that behind the smooth façade of Petrine institutions, relations of the ancient type still prevailed. In the last part, which focuses on the reign of Catherine II, the author pinpoints the early stages of a significant evolution in the way senior and junior officials viewed the nature of hierarchical relations, and gives her interpretation of the various causes of those changes.

N2  - The article tells the story of the rise of four generations of the Shagarov family from low-level service status (cossack) in a Muscovite borderland to noble status in eighteenth-century Russia. The text focuses on key moments and events in the family’s rise. In addition to questions of social (and geographical) mobility, the authors discuss the connections between service, economic entrepreneurship, personalized authority relationships, networks of patronage and protection, the salience of local conditions and relationships (and how they related to the center), the development of the Muscovite bureaucracy (especially questions of professionalization and the relationship between provincial and Moscow service), administrative effectiveness and corruption, and finally the ongoing motif of regular government. On the whole, the reader will see how an ambitious family navigated the “system,” what they did to survive and thrive, how they struggled, how social mobility more broadly could be achieved, how crucial economic success was to success in service and to the process of ennoblement, and how servitors experienced the Table of Ranks and other Petrine reforms. The authors show that upward mobility did not depend entirely on statist or tsarist mechanisms. By highlighting the multiple mechanisms and pathways to mobility that the Shagarovs worked and experienced, this article demonstrates how individuals and/or families (in this case family solidarity was a critical factor in success) could take charge of their own future and take advantage of the changing conditions and opportunities that arose. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

N2  - Increased citizen participation in policy processes through voluntary civic associations warrants an analysis of their effectiveness, which this article undertakes using a multiple constituency framework. We find a gap in the literature on nonprofit effectiveness where theoretical and empirical studies have mainly focused on organizations that directly provide tangible goods and services. We propose a multiple constituency approach to evaluate and understand the implications for assessing the organizational effectiveness of community-based advisory civic associations. We empirically analyze the evaluation of Los Angeles neighborhood councils by three different constituency groups-citizen participants, street-level bureaucrats, and city council staffs. We find that the effectiveness ratings of the constituency groups are dissimilar on different dimensions of effectiveness. These findings suggest that the multiple constituency framework holds theoretical and practical value for understanding the organizational effectiveness of voluntary associations, where the different goals of various stakeholders lead to different views on effectiveness.

N2  - Lobbies or interest groups are inherent in contemporary democratic societies and are an element of guarantee of representativeness, as well as a mechanism facilitating technical knowledge to public rulers and policy makers. In order to avoid the risks of corruption from undue influence and its activity being beneficial to society, preventive measures such as the transparency of its action must be established through the compulsory registration of interest groups and the publication of the agenda of senior officials, the development of institutional integrity systems and equal access to all interests, not only in the regulatory field, but especially in the field of public procurement.

N2  - The outbreak of Covid-19 provoked a massive shock for political institutions and societal groups. A crucial question is how such an external event affects the balance of access to political gatekeepers. In particular: Are organizations, which are highly affected by the crisis, able to increase their political voice? To address this, we focus on changes in lobbying access to key venues of public policy: government, parliament, the bureaucracy, and the media across 10 European democracies. Based on novel survey data, we assess changes in access shortly after the outbreak of Covid-19. Our findings show that affectedness is an important driver of changes in access to all venues. We interpret this as good news for the functioning of European systems of interest representation, and the ability of gatekeepers to open their doors to affected groups. However, we also show that the effect of affectedness varies considerably for economic and non-economic interests.

N2  - after the tumultuous Soekarno government in the late 1960's, the army chief General Suharto emerged as a new leader with the primary task to repair Indonesia's economic growth and restore the international community's confidence in Indonesia's economy. To carry out this tremendous challenge, Suharto appointed a group of talented economist from the University of Indonesia who mostly were graduated from the United States best known as the Technocrats. The Technocrats were able to assist Suharto in restoring and even delivering an unprecedented economic growth of more than 5% with full support from the international community during the late 1960s to the early 1990s. However, in the next stage, the Technocrats had to face even more challenges as they confronted vested interest groups when they tried to push for substantial economic governance reform, like the so called `financial generals', conglomerates and nationalist bureaucrats. This article will provide an analysis on the political aspects of the Technocrats embarking on this economic governance reform and identifying the extent of the progress of this reform. This article reveals how the Technocrats were eventually overwhelmed by their political adversary, thus was only able to deliver limited economic governance reform. This article utilizes primary sources including diplomatic correspondence, memos, reports from the United Kingdom (UK) Foreign Commonwealth Office and the Australia Department of Foreign Affairs as well as Indonesian and international mass media articles. To complement the documents, interviews with more than 30 relevant resource persons who mainly served or were indirectly involved in Suharto's government.

N2  - Making Modernism Soviet provides a new understanding of the ideological engagement of Russian modern artists such as Kazimir Malevich, Alexander Rodchenko, and Vera Ermolaeva with the political and social agenda of the Bolsheviks in the chaotic years immediately following the Russian Revolution. Focusing on the relationship between power brokers and cultural institutions under conditions of state patronage, Pamela Kachurin lays to rest the myth of the imposition of control from above upon a victimized artistic community. Drawing on extensive archival research, she shows that Russian modernists used their positions within the expanding Soviet arts bureaucracy to build up networks of like-minded colleagues. Their commitment to one another and to the task of creating a socially transformative visual language for the new Soviet context allowed them to produce some of their most famous works of art. But it also contributed to the “Sovietization” of the art world that eventually sealed their fate. © 2013 by Northwestern University Press.

N2  - Perceptions of deservingness are crucial when we attempt to explain public support for welfare policies or try to understand the development of modern welfare states. These perceptions also reveal the status of a particular population group in society and the social cohesion between marginalized groups and the general public. In this article, we are concerned about whether perceptions of the deservingness of social assistance recipients vary between different street-level bureaucrat groups, citizens and those individuals who have received social assistance or whose family members have been recipients of social assistance at some stage of their life. We focus on the nature of the impact of various individual level factors in these perceptions. The studied street-level bureaucrats are social workers in municipalities, deacons of the Church of Finland and benefit officials of the Social Security Institution of Finland. Two nationwide surveys among street-level bureaucrats (N = 2,124) and citizens (N = 1,883) are used. Descriptive statistics and rank ordered logistic regression are utilized. According to the results, street-level bureaucrats and the general public perceive social assistance recipients in quite a positive way. However, there are clear differences between and within these groups. Street-level bureaucrats' attitudes towards social assistance recipients are more positive than those among the public. However, benefit officials have a more critical stance on the deservingness of social assistance recipients than social workers and deacons. Those who have received social assistance are more positive than those who have not had these experiences. Age, education and political identification further explain the attitudes of bureaucrats and citizens.

N2  - Why do parties appoint outsiders and experts to ministerial positions?
Extant research offers explanations based on institutional arrangements
and external shocks (e.g. political or economic crises). We go beyond
such system-level variables to argue that the characteristics of
ministerial appointees are a function of the portfolio they are being
appointed to. Drawing on theories of political delegation, we argue that
outsider and expert appointments to ministerial office are affected by a
portfolio's policy jurisdiction, its financial resources and appointment
powers, and the partisan leanings of the ministerial bureaucracy. We
test these arguments on all appointments of senior and junior ministers
in Austria between 1945 and 2020. The analysis shows that outsiders are
more likely to be appointed to ministries with greater party support in
the bureaucracy, while experts are more likely appointed to portfolios
dealing with high-salience issues.

N2  - The domestic violence (DV) movement in Japan demonstrates one way civil society can influence national policy. The leadership of the DV movement built a large and diverse coalition representing more than 50 DV-related organizations all over Japan, which generated expertise on the ground, autonomy to focus on the issue, and an electoral opportunity for DV law reformers. DV leaders also developed an effective alliance with bipartisan female politicians. By turning their demands into 179 questions addressed to government bureaucrats, they generated responses that enabled women in politics to exercise effective pressure in favor of change . Analyzing this new type of activism, which I call "civic lawmaking," offers a close look at a fresh form of legislative advocacy and deepens our understanding of the state-society relationship in Japan.(1)

N2  - This paper considers a domain of governance and trade freedom indicators in order to reveal some of the dimensions along which the MENA region's intra-regional trade and export intensity might be fostered. Historically, conflicts, crises and oil interests have impeded intra-MENA integration efforts and kept trade-flow intensities between the region's countries below those of its trade with RoW. But it seems evident that similarities in the governance and trade freedom indicators of MENA countries would promote such trade flows. Our empirical methodology here is to use a classical trade gravity model with augmented variables to measure intra-regional trade and export flows for MENA countries and compare them with flows for MENA_E.U. and MENA_RoW. We develop three sets of scenarios to capture the impact of governance and trade freedom indicators accordingly: First, we introduce a standardised polity index to measure its impact on accelerating intra MENA's export flows compared with MENA_EU and MENA_RoW. Second, we introduce a range-based Polity IV index and trade freedom index to test whether similarity in the governance indicators of MENA countries leads to significant intra-regional trade flows. We also test the interaction between both. Finally, to check the robustness of export flows, we include World Governance Indicators (WGI) and their sub-components in the estimations. The main result is that when two MENA trade partners are both classified as mixed regimes under the Polity IV index ranges, the coefficient becomes highly significant and bilateral trade flows increase by 1.25%. Components of (WGI) specifying government effectiveness, rule of law and control of corruption increase exports for MENA's origin exporter countries. Finally, the interaction term (Polity IV and Trade freedom ranges) captures continuous improvement in the quality of governance and self-regulated systems implemented by governing executives and authorities as they shift away from pressure and interest groups. This leads to higher degrees of mutual understanding and benefits to the region's trade flows and policies.

N2  - Introduction Since its 1949 founding, the political system of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) has rested firmly on the principle of representative democracy. The framers of the German constitution, fearing supposed anti-democratic popular tendencies, designed moderating institutions between the people and the exercise of power. Political parties became the most important of these. Political scientists have characterised the FRG as a ‘party-state’ in which parties make all of the most important political decisions. The German constitution, the Basic Law, explicitly assigns them the role of ‘forming the political will of the people’ (Conradt 1993: 84–85). Parties control access to the legislatures at all levels, in terms of both candidate selection and group access to the policy-making process. Strict party discipline, especially at the federal level, assures party dominance. Germany has a neo-corporatist system in which interests are organised and articulated in a structured fashion. Interest groups must have state recognition to obtain formal representation in the policy process (Dalton 1993: 237, 271). Interest representation has traditionally been channelled through four major interest alignments (mainly business and labour, less crucially agriculture and churches), each with direct access to the parties and government bureaucracies. Groups outside of these four categories have had difficulty gaining access to policy channels (see Conradt 1993: 109). Women's political representation in Germany has traditionally lagged behind some other western European countries, but began to catch up in the 1990s. Today women are represented at a rate above the European Union average.

N2  - The demand for the Indian timbers increased in the beginning of the 19th century. This forced the Colonial Government to depute officials for formulating new policies and enacting forest acts in British occupied territories of India. Madras was one such presidency where the timber was in abundant and the new policies of the government expedited the deforestation of forest reserves in south India after 1800 CE. The scientific forestry in South India was started in 1806 after the appointment of Captain Watson, a Police officer as first conservator of India. This paper reconnoitres the history and functioning of the Forest department in Madras presidency during the period between H.F. Cleghorn's appointment in 1856 as the first regular Conservator of Forests and the enactment of the first Madras Forest Act in 1882.

N2  - The article is dedicated to the complex analysis of lobbying in the United Kingdom during the late XX - early XXI centuries. Lobbying is an integral element of UK politics, at the same time we still have insufficient knowledge about interest groups. Interaction between interest groups and the government is becoming more diverse and multileveled. The author aims to examine the lobbying mechanism in the UK. The author also analyzes the ways which interest groups and lobbyists use to interact with civil service, QUANGOs, political parties and the parliament, the cabinet of ministers and the prime minister. The article also touches upon the issues concerning the evolution and the current state of lobbying regulation. The author comes to conclusion that tendencies of lobbying development have a twofold nature. On the one hand, interest groups and officials are keen to preserve the mechanism of interaction. For the parties and the government that means receiving information and resources. Interest groups would like to preserve the traditions of openness and to have stable relations with the decision makers. On the other hand, permanent scandals, low level of public trust towards lobbyists and falling legitimacy of the parties force politicians and lobbyists to look for ways of regulation the lobbying environment. Despite the revision of codes of conduct and adoption of the first lobbying law in history, most lobbying relations stay in shadow, because many politicians are concerned that it could limit their freedom in decision making. Hence, the development of lobbying in the UK depends on the balance between preserving the freedom of cooperation between interest groups and the government and transparency of the political process.

N2  - In order to promote industrialization and improve the living standards of the population in the Sub-Current article is dedicated to lobbying development in post-socialist EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe. This is an important and at the same time insufficiently studied aspect of political systems in CEE. Models of lobbying in Slovenia and Poland that are analyzed in the article, demonstrate that there is no single vector of lobbying development in post-socialist countries. It is shown that interaction between interest groups and decision makers is influenced by following factors: dynamics and state of interest group systems, mechanism of interaction between interest groups and decision makers, Europeanization of politics, and particularities of lobbying regulation. Author comes to several conclusions: 1) Both countries have inherited tradition of informal political relations, but there is difference between corporatist model in Slovenia that resulted in more stable interest group system and Polish neoliberal model that gave birth to more conflict driven interest group system; 2) Europeanization of politics had different impact on the state of lobbying on national level, fostering its development in Slovenian case and having little impact in Poland; 3) Although majority of lobbying is happening in the executive branch, parties are the main mediators between interest groups and decision making; 4) Neither of analyzed countries are ideal in terms of lobbying regulation. However, Slovenia did progress further in comparison with Poland, using more transparent registration and reporting for lobbyists and officials and also regulating indirect forms of lobbying; at the same time most of lobbying takes places in shadows while regulation aimed only at professional consultants is not efficient enough.

N2  - Congress and the executive branch are currently considering changes to the officer personnel management system. Some of these proposed changes would require changes to the laws, including provision enacted by the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) and the Goldwater-Nichols Act (GNA). Contemporary debates over officer personnel management policy often revolve around the fundamental questions of “what type of officers do we need to win the next war?” and “what skills does the officer corps need to enable the military services to perform their missions?” These questions are implicitly oriented towards future events. Their answers are therefore somewhat speculative. Still, contemporary trends and military history can provide valuable insight. Additionally, a set of broader questions can help focus the analysis: • What will be the key security interests and priorities of the United States in the future? • What conflicts will likely arise in the pursuit of these interests? • What opponents will we face in these conflicts? • How will they fight? • What military strategy will the United States employ to secure its interests? How will we fight? What knowledge, skills, and abilities must the officer corps possess to effectively carry out these roles and missions? How do we attract and retain individuals with the necessary potential for service as officers? • How should the officer corps be prepared so it can effectively adapt to unforeseen crises and contingencies? • Given limited resources, what are the most critical areas for improvement? • Where should the nation accept risk? Policymakers often have divergent answers to these questions and thus come to different conclusions about the most appropriate officer personnel management policies. Examples of diverging views can be found in debates on the criteria for accepting or rejecting people for military service; required training and education over the course of a career; assignments to be emphasized; distribution of officers by grade; retention of experienced and talented individuals; and the criteria for selecting individuals for promotion and for separation. In the exercise of its constitutional authority over the armed forces, Congress has enacted an array of laws governing military officer personnel management and periodically changes these laws as it deems appropriate. This report provides an overview of selected concepts and statutory provisions that shape and define officer appointments, assignments, grade structure, promotions, and separations. It also provides a set of questions that policymakers may wish to consider when discussing proposed changes to current law.

N2  - In the exercise of its constitutional authority over the Armed Forces, Congress has enacted an array of laws which govern important aspects of military officer personnel management, including appointments, assignments, grade structure, promotions, and separations. Some of these laws are directed specifically at the most senior military officers, known as general and flag officers (GFOs). Congress periodically reviews these laws and considers changes as it deems appropriate. Areas of congressional interest have included the number of GFOs authorized, the proportion of GFOs to the total force, compensation levels of GFOs, and duties and grades of certain GFOs. As of December 2015, there were 896 active duty GFOs subject to statutory caps, which is 66 less than the maximum number authorized by law. There were also another 19 exempt from the statutory caps. The current number is about average for the post-Cold War era, though substantially lower than the number of GFOs in the 1960s-1980s, when the Armed Forces were much larger in size than they are today. However, while always very small in comparison to the total force, the general and flag officer corps has increased as a percentage of the total force over the past five decades. GFOs made up about one-twentieth of one percent (0.048%) of the total force in 1965, while they made up about one-fifteenth of one percent (0.069%) of the total force in 2015, indicating that the share of the total force made up of GFOs increased by 43%. Some argue that this increased proportion of GFOs is wasteful and contributes to more bureaucratic decisionmaking processes. Others counter that the increased proportion is linked to the military’s greater emphasis on joint and coalition operations, core organizational requirements, and the increasing use of advanced technologies. Compensation for GFOs varies. One commonly used measure of compensation, known as regular military compensation (RMC), includes basic pay, basic allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence, and the federal tax advantage associated with allowances, which are exempt from federal income tax. The lowest-ranking GFOs make about $194,000 per year in RMC, while the highest-ranking GFOs make about $231,000 per year. For the past two years, Congress has included provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act to deny GFOs any increase in basic pay, which is the largest component of RMC. Congress has also used its authority to specify the grade and duties of certain GFO positions. For example, Congress increased the grade of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB) from Lieutenant General to General in 2008. Three years later, Congress again changed the law to specify that the CNGB was a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff whose duties included “the specific responsibility of addressing matters involving non-Federalized National Guard forces in support of homeland defense and civil support missions.” This report provides an overview of active duty GFOs in the United States Armed Forces—including authorizations, duties, and compensation—historical trends in the proportion of GFOs relative to the total force, criticisms and justifications of GFO to total force proportions, and statutory controls. National Guard and Reserve GFOs are not addressed in this report, unless they are serving on active duty in a manner that counts against the active duty caps on GFOs.

N2  - Understanding representation is central to politics. Numerous studies assess under which conditions politicians share citizens’ ideological preferences. However, under which conditions bureaucrats share citizens’ ideological preferences has not been systematically studied. Yet, bureaucratic preferences shape policy outcomes. Our paper thus studies why bureaucrats are more right or left-wing than citizens in some countries and points of time, yet not others. We theorize that political ideologies of past incumbents shape this variation. Incumbents can select ideologically aligned bureaucrats and socialize bureaucrats into ideological preferences; moreover, prospective bureaucrats may self-select into ideologically aligned governments. As bureaucratic tenure exceeds political tenure, this politicization has lasting effects. Survey data from 87 countries supports this argument: bureaucrats are more left-leaning than citizens in countries with longer prior rule by economically left-wing governments, and more right-wing in countries with more authoritarian pasts. This suggests that incumbents continue to shape the ideological preferences of bureaucrats after leaving office.

N2  - One of the most important features that distinguishes ideal type bureaucracy from patrimonial bureaucracies is their relations with politics. These relations, determined within the constitutional framework, can operate in informal ways in some countries where traditional authorities are settled. Today, despite the existence of democratic rules and institutions in neopatrimonial countries, the ruling elites can influence bureaucracy within the scope of informal relations. In Kyrgyzstan, it is mentioned about the politics-bureaucracy relationship that takes shape around the presidents elected by the consensus of interest groups. These relationship networks, which differ from time to time, can also turn into compromises between local leadership structures and political elites. In such a system, personal relations come to the fore in the implementation of human resources functions such as hiring, appointment and dismissal in bureaucratic institutions. Therefore, it can be seen that the country's bureaucracy is inefficient, ineffective and unsuccessful. The main purpose of neopatrimonial relations is to obtain scarce resources in the country. For this reason, conflicts over the sharing of interests cause popular movements and power changes in the country.

N2  - Many politicians and reformers have suggested that allowing non- or bipartisan redistricting commissions to draw congressional districts will make elections more competitive and reduce partisan polarization. Although such commissions reduce the power of political parties and elected officials, they have been considered in 24 states from 1999 to 2006. We combine an analysis of national patterns of bill consideration with an intensive examination of legislative activity in three states. Our study suggests that internal pressures, such as redistricting controversies, and external pressures, such as the initiative process, contribute to the consideration of redistricting commission legislation. Furthermore, the precise combination of internal and external pressures in a state leads proposals to take one of two paths in the legislative process: a "partisan path" dominated by legislative insiders and interparty wrangling and a "good government path" where outside interest groups exercise more influence and the debate surrounds specific features of the proposal.

N2  - This article tested the facts of the disunity of the socio-political views of local officials at the beginning of the 20th century. It's previously unknown to historical science. Territorial boundaries are defined by Siberia as a remote territory of the Russian Empire, characterized by greater class heterogeneity among civil servants than in European Russia. Thus, the last governor of the Yenisei province, Ya. G. Gololobov, before his appointment to Siberia, was a member of the "Soyuz 17 October party", a deputy of the Third State Duma of the Russian Empire, a hereditary nobleman, but openly opposing conservatism in the system of government. He had many supporters of his ideas in the parliament. The reasons for the formation of his socio-political views were ideological principles, which consisted in the need for changes. On the basis of archival materials, it has been proved that officials in Siberia (natives of the peasant and bourgeois environment) were more susceptible to tendencies characteristic of the oppositional mass consciousness of the early 20th century. For example, the stories of an employee of the notary office of the city of Kansk (M.D. Yudin) and a clerical employee of the Yenisei Provincial Administration (A.F. Ilyushin), who committed crimes against the order of administration, but were not brought to the appropriate legal responsibility for unknown reasons, are shown. The first of them, a peasant by origin M.D. Yudin participated in the shooting at Gorodovoy of the Kansk district police in 1910. M.D. Yudin was sentenced to short-term arrest. He was listed in the police structures as a politically unreliable person. He was involved in revolutionary sabotage; however, he continued his career and in 1916 even served as a notary of the city Kansk. The second, official A.F. Ilyushin was the tradesman of the city of Achinsk. He outraged the state flag of the Russian Empire publicly in 1908. He told slogans of proclamation of the revolutionary events of 1905-1907. He tried unsuccessfully to continue his career in the Tomsk province, but he managed to recover in the staff of the Yenisei provincial administration. Archival data indicate that AF Ilyushin worked in the system of public administration until 1919. The top officials of the Irkutsk Governor-General saw the reasons for the disunity and opposition of political views among officials in the low level of salaries. The statistics presented in the article from the reports of officials of the interdepartmental meeting proves that the remuneration of civil servants does not correspond to the requirements of the time in the conditions of the high cost of the beginning of the 20th century.

N2  - The aim of this article is to trace neoconservative thought in the US and policy activism on the role of the US in Bosnia during the 1992-1995 genocide. This paper argues that, on the issue of intervention in Bosnia, neoconservatives in the US comprised two camps. Neoconservative former government officials were early and consistent advocates of an assertive US intervention in Bosnia. However, the neoconservative academics were a heterogeneous group divided over the question of US intervention. Yet, both the former government officials and several academics came together in supporting President Bill Clinton's decision to deploy US troops to enforce the Dayton Peace Accords. While sharply criticized in the Muslim world for their Middle East policies, neoconservative advocacy for Bosnia and Bosnian Muslims during 1992-1995 has been largely overlooked. Analysing neoconservatives' activism on Bosnia provides for a more nuanced understanding of the US neoconservative foreign policy legacy.

N2  - This chapter charts political changes to the Japanese education policy making process, by analyzing the relative relations and power between four main actors: the ruling and opposition parties in the Diet, influential LDP Diet members with a special interest in the area (zoku-giin), civil servants, and lastly interest groups and social groups in civil society. This analysis elucidates the characteristics of the traditional policymaking process under the so-called ‘1955 System’ to the newly fermented ‘Prime Ministerial leadership’ (Kantei-shudō). The features of contemporary education policy are set within this framework, before finally commenting on the top-down nature of Japanese education reform from the Meiji restoration to today.

N2  - Indonesia has all ingredients for success: A stable, democracy, a wealth of natural resources and a large consumer market. But Indonesia is not keeping pace with Asia's booming economies. There are many factors that influence the success of development. One factor is ineffective and inefficient policies and public administration. There is a problem with human resources as well as systems. Low integrity and unresponsive attitude of government officials, vested interest, corruption and nepotism are still rampant. Quality of Indonesia's Civil Service is still low. Incompetence and not really professional. There are symptoms of Prismatic Society, such us a big difference between the formal regulations and the real practice occurred on the ground. In other words, beside formal organizations, there are informal organizations that are being funded by a non-budgetary source of income and often the existence is hidden. Nobody wants to talk about but the effect is very significant Merit system is still not fully implemented. There is still a practice of nepotism and patronage. There is no good governance; budgeting management is not yet transparent. Lack of community participation. The absence of public accountability. Governments are required to do the right strategy choice as a lever (leverages) to overcome these challenges, although the choice of this strategy is difficult because it is a dilemma Administration of the State can play an important role in the formulation and implementation of public policy. Linear approach should be replaced with all-round approach to systems thinking, public administration process as a cycle of planning, organizing, implementing, and monitoring/feedback. Political leadership Administrative reform Corruption Eradication and Development of the National Education System to enable to produce able people-thinking ahead, thinking again and thinking across. Able people, agile process and conducive culture are the main elements for energizing dynamic governance. Governance system will remain relevant and effective if it is always adjusting, innovative and adapt to the changing needs of society in a changing environment. Strong and visionary leadership, administrative reform, combating corruption, and the development of the national education system, can support changes towards the development of innovative. {[}government] must constantly reflect itself, anticipate future scenarios, adapt to changing circumstances and have the capacity to respond well to unexpected events.

N2  - Context Scotland is the first country in the world to pass legislation introducing a minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol in an attempt to reduce consumption and associated harms by increasing the price of the cheapest alcohol. We investigated the competing ways in which policy stakeholders presented the debate. We then established whether a change in framing helped explain the policy's emergence. Methods We conducted a detailed policy case study through analysis of evidence submitted to the Scottish parliament, and in-depth, one-to-one interviews (n = 36) with politicians, civil servants, advocates, researchers, and industry representatives. Findings Public- and voluntary-sector stakeholders tended to support MUP, while industry representatives were more divided. Two markedly different ways of presenting alcohol as a policy problem were evident. Critics of MUP (all of whom were related to industry) emphasized social disorder issues, particularly among young people, and hence argued for targeted approaches. In contrast, advocates for MUP (with the exception of those in industry) focused on alcohol as a health issue arising from overconsumption at a population level, thus suggesting that population-based interventions were necessary. Industry stakeholders favoring MUP adopted a hybrid framing, maintaining several aspects of the critical framing. Our interview data showed that public health advocates worked hard to redefine the policy issue by deliberately presenting a consistent alternative framing. Conclusions Framing alcohol policy as a broad, multisectoral, public health issue that requires a whole-population approach has been crucial to enabling policymakers to seriously consider MUP, and public health advocates intentionally presented alcohol policy in this way. This reframing helped prioritize public health considerations in the policy debate and represents a deliberate strategy for consideration by those advocating for policy change around the world and in other public health areas.

N2  - Aims: To explore how policy actors attempted to deliberately frame public debate around alcohol minimum unit pricing (MUP) in the UK by comparing and contrasting their constructions of the policy in public (newspapers), semi-public (evidence submissions) and private (interviews). Methods: Content analysis was conducted on articles published in ten national newspapers between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2012. Newsprint data were contrasted with alcohol policy documents, evidence submissions to the Scottish Parliament's Health and Sport Committee and 36 confidential interviews with policy stakeholders (academics, advocates, industry representatives, politicians and civil servants). Findings: A range of policy actors exerted influence both directly (through Parliamentary institutions and political representatives) and indirectly through the mass media. Policy actors were acutely aware of mass media's importance in shaping public opinion and used it tactically to influence policy. They often framed messages in subtly different ways, depending on target audiences. In general, newspapers presented the policy debate in a "balanced'' way, but this arguably over-represented hostile perspective and suggested greater disagreement around the evidence base than is the case. Conclusions: The roles of policy actors vary between public and policy spheres, and how messages are communicated in policy debates depends on perceived strategic advantage.

N2  - Each stage of our national development has had a distinctive form of public policy. And each has faced a core tension between the dictates of governance and the constraints of democracy. Economic or social interests, and advantage-seeking politicians, forge policies. Countervailing interests, or changing times, or the limits of state capacity see to it that those policies rarely if ever live up to the expectations of their progenitors. But then no one ever said that the American polity, to say nothing of its democratic ideal, is a neat or orderly thing. Theodore Lowi's classic distributionist-regulatory-redistributionist trinity has been the most useful way of categorizing American public policy. It works best when applied to the long period of national development that stretched from the creation of the Republic to the Great Depression and the New Deal. Lowi himself observed in 1969 that a deep and permanent change in the American Constitution was under way. And a decade later he concluded that the First Republic, during which his policy trinity grew and flourished, was gone. In its place a Second Republic had risen, in which a strong national state was regarded not as a necessary evil but a positive good, raising serious issues of democratic accountability. In a recent book, I divide the history of American public life into three regimes, each extending over a substantial period of time, and in each of which American politics, government, and law have a distinctive character. I label these regimes the deferential-republican (running through the colonial period and the early Republic), the party-democratic (from the 1820s to the 1930s), and the populist-bureaucratic (from the 1930s to the present). It was in the party-democratic regime that distributionist, then regulatory, and (less so) redistributionist policies flourished. But do these categories work as well for the current populist-bureaucratic regime, Lowi's Second Republic? The new regime's politics are more populist- Than party-defined: that is, more driven by ideology, advocacy groups, the media, and autonomous politicians than by the dictates of organized parties and professional politicians. And its government and legal system are driven by the values of a bureaucratic-administrative mindset rather than by the more traditional constraints that in the past made for a weak state and a formalistic constitutional law. A new world of public policy emerged from the New Deal and the Great Society, World War II, the Cold War, Korea, and Vietnam. The bureaucracy grew from the tight little world of the Federal Triangle to the expansive world of The Beltway. An assertive, policy-minded judiciary and media, a dense network of advocacy groups, think tanks, universities, and foundations, pumping high-octane expertise into the engine of government, joined (and to a degree displaced) the major political parties as public policymakers. The result is a new American state, whose character and dimensions we are only beginning to apprehend. The depth and diversity of modern public policy is notable. So too is the degree of discontent with the new American state. From the 1970s on, the view that it is "ungovernable" has been widespread. One source of the problem, according to political scientist James Q. Wilson, was that in the 1960s there emerged "a true national state within the confines of a constitutional system designed to ensure that no such state would be created." I propose to examine briefly several major categories of public policy in this new regime. Although distributionist, regulatory, and redistributionist qualities may be seen in each of them, none is adequately defined by the Lowi typology. Each of these policy areas has raised problems of democratic accountability that were present in previous periods of American history, but they have a more pronounced character in a polity whose politics are populist and governance is bureaucratic. Notable too is the phenomenon that sociologist Robert Merton called "the unanticipated consequences of purposeful social action."

N2  - In the 1970s politics in Tanzania was substantially a bureaucratic affair. Since the 1980s, however, economic liberalisation, multiparty democracy and governance reforms have on the one hand introduced measures conducive to building a legal-rational bureaucracy and a liberal civil society, and on the other accelerated political struggle for economic resources through personalised regional networks. Paraphrasing Emmanuel Terray, the first trend is described in this article as the manufacture of 'air-conditioned' politics, the second as the growth of 'veranda' politics. The article argues that donor reforms are not leading in a straight line to liberal governance, but neither is civil society simply being colonised by patrimonial networks. Rather, both 'air-conditioned' politics and 'veranda' politics are advancing simultaneously, inundating a previously bureaucratised political sphere. The dual character of this 're-politicisation' makes the fate of governance reforms exceedingly difficult to predict.

N2  - Past scholarship has offered varying explanations for why presidents choose to use executive orders. However, to this point, much of what we know of unilateral powers does not adequately address the role the bureaucracy plays in the president's decision. This research seeks to account for bureaucratic factors as a strategic presidential consideration in the employment of such directives. I classify executive orders from 1989–2012 based on which agency or agencies they apply to, and consider the importance of various characteristics (e.g. agency ideology, level of centralization, politicization, etc.) in determining which organs of the bureaucracy presidents will direct executive orders to generally. The results provide evidence that the White House directs fewer executive orders to agencies that have a politically independent leadership structure, and this result holds across a variety of measures judging an order's impact. The results demonstrate that the type of directive is crucial in determining a president's strategic decision to use executive orders, in line with previous research, and that agency centralization is one crucial component of this strategic calculation.

N2  - Purpose - The paper seeks to address the European Union's emerging role in the management of international security challenges and its implications for collaboration in armaments procurement. While the former is about integrating member governments at policy level, the latter concerns organising states' defence industries into a cohesive and competitive supply base. Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical frameworks include historic-comparative analysis and the bureaucratic politics model. Independent variable comprises state actors and interest groups, while the dependent variable comprises the outcomes in terms of defence policy and armaments collaboration decisions. European armaments integration is considered, contrasting liberal inter-governmentalism and neo-functionalism theory. Case study data are derived from official EU document sources. Findings - In general, national governments tend to protect important industrial actors irrespective of ownership. Bringing market and defence issues closer challenges the traditional separation between "low" and "high" politics. The collaboration in armaments acquisition is ad hoc and somewhat piecemeal in nature. Structures have evolved in an attempt to integrate the armaments process with spill-over effect at policy level fostering armaments integration, helped by a more favourably structured and organised defence industry symptomatic of neo-functionalism. Co-ordination of European defence policy and armaments procurement through EDA should, in theory, lead to longer-term co-ordination, co-operation and integration between the member states. The latter may see it in their interests to integrate as they come to recognize that EU institutions lack the capabilities to make policies realistic. Originality/value - European armaments procurement and integration is not well researched; nor are the theoretical issues well understood. An explanation (model) of European armaments procurement integration is developed, along with an identification of key facilitators.

N2  - This article examines nonprofit environmental groups to demonstrate the impact of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulation on nonprofit organizations interested in advocacy work. This regulation encourages nonprofits interested in extended advocacy to form additional, related tax-exempt entities, creating complex nonprofit structures. Although regulatory barriers to charitable lobbying have received some attention, little has been written on how regulatory policy shapes the organizational structures, finances, and programming of nonprofits involved in advocacy. This study analyzes the complex structures of five environmental nonprofit groups using information they file with the IRS and FEC and interviews with key officers and representatives. It finds that even with strict regulatory compliance, financial and programmatic relationships across these complex structures can vary creating different types of complex nonprofit structures. The article models the different complex nonprofit structures and provides an analysis of the historical and legal risk factors that underlie them.

N2  - This article first outlines the major indirect sources and pathways of influence that interest groups use outside and within the administrative process to influence agency rulemaking. After reviewing the growth and changing nature of interest groups following and involved in rulemaking in Washington, it presents brief synopses of the avenues of influence available to them - presidency, the courts, and the Congress. A discussion of the more direct avenues for interest group influence is also presented, affording an overview of the rulemaking process. The four major opportunities for interest group participation and influence in the rulemaking process are reported: the agendasetting stage, the pre-proposal stage, the notice-and-comment stage, and regulatory negotiation. It further offers an explanation of what is seen as the most profitable principles to apply in future research on this vastly understudied yet vital topic in American bureaucracy.

N2  - Public assemblies, where people gather around specific institutionalised places, are common in most African countries. This chapter focuses on the kgotla in Botswana as a formal public assembly associated with the institution of traditional leadership. The kgotla allows for public debate on development interventions (policy/programs) and contributes significantly to rural livelihoods and natural resources management, and provide free access to justice for rural households, especially the poor. In the past, kgotla meetings were held in Ngamiland to inform the public about eradication of the district herd, the Integrated Tsetse Eradication Campaign, proposed dredging of Boro river, identification of biodiversity "hotspots" for the Okavango Delta Management Plan (ODMP), and on the adverse effects of forest fires. Although the kgotla thus performs a major function in participatory governance, participation is still determined by several factors such as gender, location, socio-economic status and individual agency. The chapter states that the kgotla in contemporary Botswana has at least five functions. Firstly it provides the village-community with the means to come to an agreement on the implementation of specific community development programmes/projects. Secondly, traditional leaders can use the kgotla to discuss or solicit views from the villagecommunity on government policy decisions, or any other interest groups. Thirdly, government officials, including members of parliament and councillors, see the kgotla as a means of informing various village-communities about new legislations or programmes. Fourthly, the kgotla is a judicial institution in which cases are heard by the chief and his advisors. Lastly, the kgotla has been translated into a site of resistance or a place where voices clash and strive to reach a compromise. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

The model envisaged transferring the management of primary healthcare facilities to a public sector NGO. The paper finds that through the re-alignment of interest groups, the model was replicated in several other districts of the province. It also examines the evolution of stakeholders' behaviour, interest, position and influence in its implementation over a period of time. The study concludes that sustainability of the model remains doubtful unless public sector health bureaucracy is restructured and made to work effectively.

N2  - The present state of governance in Bangladesh is evaluated here using the concept of governance, particularly good governance. Bangladesh shows all the symptoms of an underdeveloped polity. Democracy has not been institutionalized. Politics continues to be dominated by big money, goons and people with little background and training in formal politics. Elections have become such an expensive affair that ordinary citizens act only as passive voters. Power and authority are concentrated at the top echelons of government. Corruption has become so endemic that it has engulfed the entire society. Both the supreme leaders of two major political parties, ie the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, were handed top leadership positions for reasons of heredity and kinship. This permanent nature of supreme leadership has thwarted internal democracy in political parties' function and management. The dominant position of the executive is widely known. The parliamentary system that is in existence can best be termed a prime ministerial system. The parliament is content to play second fiddle to the executive. Lack of independence of the judiciary has resulted in its heavy dependence on the executive. Lack of accountability and transparency in the affairs of the state is a major impediment to effective governance. The human rights situation remains unsatisfactory. One of the pressing problems of governance is the politicization of the public bureaucracy, with adverse effects on performance. Expenditure on the military continues to rise without any apparent justification.

N2  - The present study of the changes that took place in the center/regions
system under Stalin and Khrushchev is based on documents relating to the
purges and mutations of Soviet regional leaders and to the evolution of
the mechanisms of control over cadres (the nomenklatura). The transition
from mass repressions of cadres to the stabilization of their situation,
which was already perceptible during Stalin's last years and took on a
definitive turn after his death, substantially transformed the situation
of Soviet regional civil servants. The progressive politicization of the
nomenklatura, the conversion of nomenklaturnye rabotniki, who were fully
accountable to Moscow, into an independent political force, was an
important condition for the decisive events of the 1990s - the collapse
of the USSR and the formation of new (in many respects old) ruling
classes in Russia and in other governments of the former USSR.

N2  - This paper is an exploratory study that investigates the status of New Public Management (NPM) and the obstacles to its implementation within the Republic of Lebanon. The study employs a qualitative approach that examines two complementary data sources. The first data source is obtained from an extensive review of documents related to new public management that are available in the public domain such as policy initiatives and governmental projects. The second data source is obtained from in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 public managers. The data collected is analyzed, using an iterative thematic content analysis. The findings suggest that the main obstacles that have inhibited the implementation of new public management in most public agencies in Lebanon include; the politicization of administration in the public sector, the lack of stability in the country, the non-targeted, inconsistent and insufficient training, institutional dysfunctions and organizational challenges, the absence of a country specific applicable model of public management and the unsystematic and non-institutionalized link between concerned international organizations and the Lebanese public agencies. This research is significant as it provides a foundation for the institutions' practices to improve the design and implementation of new public management in the country. This research not only contributes to the relevant literature but also provides policy recommendations needed to respond, to the recurrent calls for administrative reforms in the Arab world.

N2  - Purpose This paper aims to use Stones' strong structuration theory (SST) that combines Giddens' duality and Archer's analytical dualism to deal with the paradox of embedded agency, focussing on resistance, in the budgeting literature. It also applies this framework to an illustrative case study that examines a failed attempt to implement performance-based budgeting (PBB) in the Egyptian Sales Tax Department (ESTD). Design/methodology/approach The authors have used SST as an analytical framework. Longitudinal case study data were collected from interviews, observations, discussions and documentary analysis and from publicly available reports and other media issued by the World Bank. Findings The SST framework identifies the circumstances in which middle managers as embedded agency have limited possibilities to change their dispositions to act and identify opportunities for emancipation in the wider social context in which they are embedded. The official explanation for the failure to implement PBB in Egypt was obstruction by middle managers. The findings of this study provide an alternative explanation to that published by the World Bank for the failure to institutionalise PBB in Egypt. It was found that the middle managers were the real supporters of PBB. Other parties and existing laws and regulations contributed to the failure of PBB. Research limitations/implications As a practical implication of the study, the analysis presented here offers an alternative interpretation of the failure of the Egyptian project for monitoring and evaluation to that published by the World Bank. This case and similar cases may enhance the understanding of how and when monitoring and evaluation technologies should be introduced at the global level to manage conflicts of interest between agencies and beneficiaries. Originality/value This paper contributes to the extant management accounting literature on the use of ST in addressing the paradox of embedded agency in making or resisting structural change. It uses SST to integrate Giddens' ST with critical realist theory, incorporating duality and dualism in a stronger model of structuration. The SST framework offers a means of analysing case studies that result from interactions and conjunctures between different groups of actors at different ontological levels. The paper also examines the issue of embedded agency in budgeting research using an illustrative case study from a developing country, Egypt.

N2  - In the introduction to the forum on subjecthood and citizenship in the Russian and Ottoman empires the authors propose not only to compare the processes in which the two empires interacted but also to concentrate on the challenges created by modernization for the subjects and rulers of these two states. Despite significant differences in legal culture and administrative practices, not to mention self-representation, the Russian and Ottoman empires elaborated different models of relations between subjects and rulers in an era that witnessed the emergence of national movements, colonization, and mass politics. Wheeras the Ottoman Empire in 1856 had already legally equalized all subjects before the law, and in 1869 promulgated the principle of Ottoman citizenship, the Russian Empire did not acquire universal citizenship or subjecthood until 1917. Yet, these differences notwithstanding, in both the Ottoman and Russian empires ideas and practices of citizenship and subjecthood and attempts to rationalize them faced the fundamental problem of diversity. The gradual movement toward universal citizenship/subjecthood was accompanied by the preservation and development of particularism in regard to the relationship between different groups and the state. The authors conclude that there was never a single narrative of citizenship or subjecthood and that citizenship was often a claim to the position within the polity on the side of the ruled and an idea of patronage and pedagogy of the people on the side of bureaucrats and intellectuals. © 2017, Ab Imperio.

N2  - This article aims to study the process of organising a campaign with the purpose of collecting arrears from private entrepreneurs and for clearing of tax bureaucracy. The source of the research is the instructions of the Central Headquarters of the working team for the patronage over the USSR People's Commissariat for Finance and the administration of Sverdlovsk Regional Financial Administration concerning the Sverdlovsk Regional Financial Department (SRFD). The author studies the problems of adequacy of private sector taxation under the SRFD policy. This policy was one of the reasons for organising a tax campaign. The analysis of documents allows the author to conclude that the methods and means of the campaign planned testify to a radicalisation of the policy of a total and final exclusion of private sector from the country's economy, and to the abolition of the NEP mixed economy. Apart from fiscal aims proper, the authorities purposed political ones too; their goal was to demonstrate the determination of the government and to conduct a cleaning up of the financial body which was `littered' with petty-bourgeois elements. To maintain the class equality of the campaign, factory workers were actively involved which led to several legal and organisational problems and caused various instances of abuse. Rapid and unexpected mass confiscations at night which happened without prior notice and on a wide scale, with arrears collected even from relatives and acquaintances of an entrepreneur were similar to a war campaign, resembling an act of intimidation targeted at political opponents. Some points of instructions contradicted the legislature of the time in question; however, this fact was not viewed as a flaw considering the political character of this campaign. The rightful desire of the government to collect arrears under the dictatorship of proletariat and under the final stages of the NEP was transformed into a force operation accompanied by the deprivation of property of the conquered class in the spirit of the theory of `primary socialist accumulation'

N2  - This paper investigates the driving forces behind the Korean government's realestate policy decision-making. In particular, it tries to explain why inefficient and inequitable policies have persisted for so long, and why policy reform has been so sluggish. In order to do this, a few key regulations governing housing supply and land use are described and evaluated, These are the price control on new apartments, control on land-use conversion, green belts and spatial deconcentration policies. Next, it is demonstrated that the standard economic theory of interest-group politics is not appropriate in explaining the behaviour of the government officials in charge of these regulations, It is then suggested that a piecemeal and lukewarm approach to policy reform could be better understood in light of the behaviour of risk-averse government officials taking the political ramifications of their decisions very seriously.

N2  - This chapter provides an overview of the civil service system and public personnel practices in the Korean bureaucracy. The civil service in the Republic of Korea is divided into national and local civil service. The chapter reviews the history of the civil service system in Korea, followed by discussion on civil service structure, recruitment and selection, compensation and benefits, performance evaluation, status of civil servants in society, political appointment, sociopolitical and administrative culture and major civil service reforms. The Korean civil service is broadly classified into career and noncareer services depending on the terms of employment, job classification, and legal status. Korean civil servants are more concerned about living standards than those who work in the private sector. From a sociopsychological standpoint, Korean sociopolitical culture has been characterized by two salient factors: A submissive authoritarian culture deeply affected by Confucianism and Buddhism, and a high degree of cultural homogeneity—ethnic, linguistic, religious, and regional.

N2  - Documenting how the Japanese state responded to increasing social discontent during initiation of unpopular welfare reforms, this study examines the factors that hindered the political empowerment of civil society despite the timely introduction of participatory policymaking institutions. The Japanese government opted in the early 2000s to introduce a participatory method to initiate the unpopular pension reform. Deliberation councils were established to encourage open discussions among government policymakers and committee members, including citizen representatives. The final outcomes of the deliberations, however, were mostly about parametric adjustments and did not adequately consider the urgent demand of the general public. The participatory measure did not significantly improve the public's trust in the pension programs, but it did justify the government's reform initiatives. The welfare bureaucracy that set the goal, defined the scope of the agenda, and steered the discussions toward technical issues structurally restricted the voices of the citizen members in the deliberation councils. The lack of citizen advocacy groups, which could otherwise have effectively supported the citizen members on the committee, contributed to the limited roles and influences of the citizens. It is argued that the traditional conservative corporatism of Japan was reinforced during this time period, despite the introduction of the idea of participatory governance.

N2  - There were four critical undercurrents for the growth of Korean think tanks in the 1990s: democratization, the end of the Cold War, globalization coupled with local autonomy, and the expanded government budget accompanying Korea's rapid economic growth. In contrast to American think tanks which are private but normally serve as public policy advocates, most of the important Korean think tanks are supported by the government and they are not independent public policy advocates. The Korean public think tanks are highly susceptible to domestic political dynamics: for instance, the presidential office's power over the appointment of the directors. The susceptibility originates not only from the delayed democratic institutionalization of the Korean presidential system but also from the absence of financial independence, limits to the accessibility of information on policy, and the lack of professionalism in the bureaucracy. The Korea Institute for National Unification, an exemplary public think tank regarding the issue of inter-Korean relations, now focuses on research and analysis rather than policy advocacy. Alternatively, it acts as a producer of knowledge and vocabulary to envision an epistemic community for deliberating strategies of engaging with North Korea.

N2  - Contemporary American federalism can be described as an era of coercive or regulatory federalism in which the predominant political, fiscal, statutory, regulatory, and judicial trends have entailed impositions of federal dictates on state and local governments. This era began in the late 1960s and succeeded a 35-year era commonly referred to as cooperative federalism. The era of coercive federalism has been marked by a shift of federal policy-making from the interests of places (i.e., state and local governments) to the interests of persons (i.e., voters and interest groups). That is, elected federal officials, as well as the federal courts, have been highly responsive to electoral coalitions, interest groups, and campaign contributors operating in the national arena and much less responsive to elected state and local government officials. Elected state and local officials no longer have any privileged voice in Congress or the White House as elected representatives of the people; instead, they must behave like interest groups and compete with all other interest groups in the federal policymaking arena where, quite frequently, they are unable to prevail against powerful interest groups that can bring crucial financial, ideological, and voter rewards and punishments to bear on the electoral fortunes of federal officials. Consequently, as U.S. Senator Carl Levin (Democrat-Michigan) commented to this author in 1988, 'There is no political capital [for members of Congress] in intergovernmental relations,' that is, in catering to the concerns of governors, state legislators, county commissioners, mayors, and the like.

N2  - This article charts the campaign for political recognition of dyslexia
in Britain, focusing on the period from 1962 when concerted interest in
the topic began. Through the Word Blind Centre for Dyslexic Children
(1963-72), and the organisations that followed, it shows how dyslexia
gradually came to be institutionalised, often in the face of government
intransigence. The article shows how this process is best conceived as a
complex interplay of groups, including advocates, researchers, civil
servants and politicians of varying political stripes. Necessarily, the
campaign was mediated through broader political, economic and social
changes, including the increasing requirement for literacy in the
productive worker, but it is not reducible to these factors. In this
way, the article reflects on the conceptualisation of power and agency
in accounts of the history of dyslexia to date and its broader relevance
to the history of learning difficulties and disabilities.

N2  - Most historians agree that the driving forces behind the making of the German colonial administration in Africa originated in Berlin. In the metropolis, so they argue, imperial infrastructures were planned and then transferred to Africa. This article, however, seeks to demonstrate that important impulses to build an infrastructure for protecting the natural environment in German East Africa came from Asia and the Pacific region. In the early 1890s, soon after the protectorate was established, the first ordinances for game control and forest management were passed, reserves were created and forest administration offices were set up. The development of this bureaucracy has to be explained in the context of the construction of forest administrations in British-India, Australia, New Zealand and the British colonies in Africa in the second half of the nineteenth century. Important influences came from a transimperial network of scientists including the members of the Indian Forest Service, the directors of the botanical gardens in Australia, Africa, and Asia, and European travellers and explorers. These "men on the spot" were the first to observe the destruction of nature in the non-European world. They drew public and political attention to the issue and fought for government intervention. Not the politicians in Berlin, but the pressure groups in South Asia and the Pacific world provided the arguments for building an infrastructure for the protection of nature in German East Africa. The forest administrations they had created in India, Australia and Africa served as models for the ecological management in the German colonies in Africa. © Oldenbourg.

N2  - In the post‐colonial era, one hitherto understudied aspect of imperialism today evoking considerable social interest is the selection of Britain's overseas civil servants. Who were they, how and why were they chosen? A recent deposit in Rhodes House Library, Oxford, offers a unique insight into the patronage system at work for first‐time appointments to the British Colonial Service between 1900 and 1914. This is a set of the Desk Diaries of the Secretary of State for the Colonies' patronage office staff. Because of their purely personal and unofficial nature, the presentation of their entries knows no constraint – and no political correctness! Typical of the age, they are often starkly class‐ridden and racist. This Note quotes numerous examples from these unique Desk Diaries and examines the selection by patronage process as it applied, not to the upper gubernatorial ranks but to those seeking an initial appointment to the rapidly expanding Colonial Service in the opening decade of the 20th century. © Oxford University Press 2002.

N2  - One of the most important political legacies of colonialism in Africa has been the reliance on the model of centralized bureaucratic administration, which has had disastrous consequences for African state-building. Like the colonial systems before them, these centralized bureaucracies have not functioned effectively. One of the main problems is a loose coupling between the formal bureaucratic structure of these states and the informal patrimonial elements, mainly patronage, that came to permeate them. Many scholars thus referred to these states as neopatrimonial. Over the past two to three decades, many governments have begun to replace centralized bureaucracies with different forms of partially patrimonial systems, including various forms of decentralization and partial privatization. This article uses both Weber and contemporary agency theory to evaluate the success of these new forms of partially patrimonial administration and to suggest ways in which they could be made more effective.

N2  - Background Globally, multisectoral coordination for nutrition is needed to tackle multiple determinants of undernutrition and address unacceptably high rates of stunting in young children. Tanzania has strong national policies and implementation plans to strengthen multisectoral nutrition (MSN) governance, yet local actors must transcend sector silos to fully implement MSN actions in communities. Objectives We engaged with Nutrition Officers in Regional Secretariats and District Councils to explore strategies, barriers, and facilitators for creating novel "MSN action teams." Methods An initial "Learning Exchange" workshop gathered input from nutrition staff in 5 regions and invited their participation in mentoring and supporting MSN collaboration. Regional Nutrition Officers piloted action teams in their districts, supporting District Nutrition Officers to create teams of 3-4 officers from relevant sectors (agriculture, community development, health, education) to plan and implement community-based activities consistent with sector priorities and national policy. To learn from stakeholder experiences, longitudinal data were collected through individual semistructured interviews and documentation of activities; 27 officers were interviewed 1-4 times over 14 mo. Results Four districts successfully created action teams that bridged communication gaps between administrators and implementors; made progress on advocacy, collaboration, and budgeting for nutrition; and initiated MSN implementation in communities. Participants identified strategies to overcome challenges to cross-sector collaboration including heavy workloads and limited resources and supervisor buy-in. Based on their experiences and innovations in creating MSN action teams, stakeholders shared valuable recommendations for peer learning across sectors to scale up MSN collaboration. Officers' presentation of insights to regional and district leaders buoyed interest in MSN action teams as a feasible and acceptable approach to strengthen local governance and implementation to improve child nutrition. Conclusions Experience-based input from government officers engaged in novel community and intersectoral collaborations provided actionable guidance for putting national MSN policy into practice and leveraging the capacity of implementation staff. In a participatory study, peer mentoring and formation of action teams helped overcome challenges to intersectoral collaboration and enhanced motivation and advocacy for community implementation of national multisectoral nutrition policies.

N2  - Over the past two centuries, the evolution of public personnel management in the United States (in national, state, and local governments) has been driven by the emergence of alternative competing values (Klingner and Nalbandian 2003). As each emergent value has gained political strength, its increased importance has been reflected in the forming of corresponding public personnel systems and their related techniques. Traditionally, conflict in the United States has centered around four fundamental values: political responsiveness, organizational efficiency and effectiveness, individual rights, and social equity. Political responsiveness is the belief that government answers to the will of the people expressed through elected officials, and the public workforce must, in turn, be made to answer to those in elective office. In a system grounded on this value, the political and personal faithfulness of public employees may best be ensured through an appointment process that considers political loyalty, along with education and experience, as indicators of merit. Often, in order to promote responsive government, elected officials are authorized to fill certain jobs through political appointments. Organizational efficiency and effectiveness reflect the desire on the part of elected officials and the public to maximize productivity. This suggests that employment decisions about whom to hire, reassign, or promote should be based on applicants' and employees' competencies, rather than on their political loyalty. The concept of individual rights suggests that citizens must be protected from unfair actions of government officials. In the context of civil service systems, public employees' rights to job security and due process are maintained through merit system rules and regulations that protect them from inappropriate partisan political pressure. In parallel fashion, public employees who are union members will have recourse to work rules contained in collective bargaining agreements that protect them from arbitrary management decisions. Social equity as a personnel value places emphasis on fairness to groups such as women, racial minorities, the disabled, and veterans, which may otherwise be disadvantaged by a market economy that accepts the legitimacy of discrimination in hiring and in pay. As is the case with individual rights as a principal value, social equity is concerned with fairness. But unlike individual rights, which are based on personal attributes like education, experience, or seniority, social equity is concerned with employment preferences based on membership in a protected class or group. Within the past quarter century, these four traditional values have been supplemented by increasingly powerful emergent "antigovernment" values. Early evidence of the rise of these values is found in the 1976 presidential campaign, won by Jimmy Carter, who ran against the national government as a Washington "outsider." Following the election, Carter proposed the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act on grounds that included poor performance in the public service and difficulty in controlling and directing bureaucrats. Beginning in 1980, the Reagan administration, though starting from fundamentally different values and policy objectives, continued to cast government as part of the problem, and to campaign against the infrastructure of public agencies and public administrators. The ascendant anti-government assumptions behind this shift were paralleled by a related general transition from political to economic perspectives on public policy. That transition emphasized the role of market forces on individuals and the economy, rather than program implementation by government agencies and employees, as the most efficacious tools of public policy (Beckett 2000). Economic perspectives and the value of administrative efficiency clearly placed intense political pressure on the public sector to "do more with less." The pressure to do more caused government to attempt to become more accountable through such techniques as program budgeting, management by objectives, program evaluation, and management information systems. The pressure to do more with less money caused governments to lower expenditures through tax and expenditure ceilings, deficit reduction, deferred expenditures, accelerated tax collection, service fees, user charges, and a range of legislative and judicial efforts to shift program responsibilities and costs away from each affected government. Since from 50 to 75 percent of public expenditures go toward employee salaries and benefits, efforts to increase accountability and reduce costs have necessarily focused to a large extent on the field of public personnel management. These underlying contemporary political and economic forces shaped three specific emerging anti-government values with implications for personnel policy: individual accountability, limited and decentralized government, and community responsibility for social services. First, proponents of individual accountability expect that people will make individual choices consistent with their own goals, and accept responsibility for the consequences of these choices, rather than passing responsibility for their actions onto the rest of society. Second, proponents of limited and decentralized government believe, fundamentally, that government is to be feared for its power to arbitrarily or capriciously deprive individuals of their rights. Advocates of this view also believe that it is easier to connect public policy, service delivery, and revenue generation in a smaller rather than larger unit of government. Decision makers are known, revenues are predictable, and services are directly visible in such circumstances, and for some, the reduction in size and scope of government is justified by the perceived ineffectiveness of government; by the high value accorded to individual freedom, responsibility and accountability; and by a reluctance to devote a greater share of personal income to taxes. Third, proponents of community responsibility for social services believe that local government agencies need to be supplemented by not-for-profit, nongovernmental organizations responsible for social services, recreation, and community development activities. For public personnel management, the most significant consequence of this value has been the creation of thousands of nonprofit organizations that routinely provide services funded by taxes, user fees, and charitable contributions. These forces-mistrust of government and increased reliance on market mechanisms-have significantly affected public management at state and local government levels as well as the federal level. In 1993 the National Commission on the State and Local Public Service, generally referred to as the Winter Commission after its chair William Winter, issued a report that was generally critical of traditional public personnel management practices. An essential tenet of that report was that while civil service systems had traditionally been designed to promote efficiency and employee rights by protecting the public service against political interference and patronage-based turnover, these systems had gradually evolved to a point where "red tape" had overly restricted management flexibility, and due process had unreasonably protected incompetent or insubordinate employees. Its fifth recommendation called for an "end to civil service paralysis" through the adoption of practices designed to make personnel management more responsive to executive leadership, more supportive of innovation and risk-taking, and more rewarding of performance (National Commission on the State and Local Public Service 1993, Thompson 1994). © 2006 State University of New York.

N2  - In many parts of Africa, university systems are in crisis; squalid conditions, student strife, and increasing state violence have turned many campuses into battlegrounds. Through an in-depth look at the Kenyan case, this paper examines some of the deep political dynamics of the current desperate situation. We demonstrate how in Kenya, state–university links involve attempts by higher-level government officials to control campuses through patronage, surveillance, and violence and how institutional configurations facilitate this. As the burden of repression falls on student activists who challenge current power configurations, we examine the current crisis through a student lens. By presenting and analyzing the historical narrative of student activism on campus, we show the inadequacy of overly structural, economic approaches to the crisis favored by the World Bank and some of its critics. Instead, we show the critical importance of understanding how the university crisis is organically linked to wider political processes, including local struggle over democratization of the state and economy. © 2002, African Studies Association.

N2  - Framing plays an important role in lobbying, as interest groups strategically highlight some aspects of policy proposals while ignoring others to shape policy debates in their favour. However, due to methodological difficulties, we have remarkably little systematic data about the framing strategies of interest groups. This article therefore proposes a new technique for measuring interest group framing that is based on a quantitative text analysis of interest group position papers and official policy documents. We test this novel methodological approach on the basis of two case studies in the areas of environmental and transport policy in the European Union. We are able to identify the frames employed by all interest groups mobilised in a debate and assess their effectiveness by studying to what extent decision-makers move closer to their policy positions over the course of the policy debate.

N2  - While a consensus seems to be emerging that bureaucracies of international organizations are of growing relevance for policy-making beyond the nation-state, we still do not systematically understand if and how exactly international bureaucracies seek to influence policy. Most importantly, there is a lack of concepts for a comparative assessment of bureaucratic influence across different International Organizations. This article addresses this shortcoming by offering a conceptualization of administrative styles. Depending on dominant strategic orientations shaping administrative routines, we identify four ideal types: a servant style, an advocacy style, a consolidator style, and an entrepreneurial style. We argue that the variation in administrative styles across different organizations can be explained by two factors, namely the internal and external challenges they face. The concept and theoretical explanation are illustrated in four case studies on the bureaucracies of the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International Settlements, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Labor Organization.

The purpose of the article is to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that the number of studies of the historical involvement of the judiciary in repression in recent years is increasing; researches cover more and more regions of the former USSR and help to create a complete picture of the special procedural law for political cases in Soviet Union in the 1930s-1950s. Methodology. The author uses historical legal method. The author analyses legal and historic literature, written by scientists who live in former USSR. Analysis of judicial statistics is used also. Results, scope of application. The history of the Soviet court remains the subject of active research interest at the present time. At the same time, special publications summarizing the entire body of scientific works on the participation of justice in mass repressions are not issued. A number of works on the history of the judicial authorities contain sections on the application of the rules of judicial procedure to political crimes. Currently, PhD theses, covering an increasing number of regions of Russia, are being defended actively. Unfortunately, some regional researchers are not familiar with the modern historiography of the judicial system and, therefore, repeats some of the conclusions that have been made before. Researchers are trying to formulate new approaches to assess the repressive policy of the Soviet state. For example, V.N. Karaman determines the repressions using political crite-rion. Researches that are not directly related to the history of judicial proceedings contain valuable information about the participation of courts in mass repressions often. Also, the group of researchers continues to develop the theme of rehabilitation of victims of political repression. New young researchers are emerging. We should also highlight a group of works on the historiography of mass repression. The appearance of such works is justified. A lot of research has accumulated for 70 years, which need to be generalized and systematized. Three of the PhD thesis, dedicated to the repression of the state security organs, five theses on the mass repressions, 14 theses on the camps during the war were defended during 1990-2010 in Siberia. The Russian-French seminars ``Judicial political processes in the USSR and Communist countries of Europe: a comparative analysis of mechanisms and practices{''}, held in 2009-2011, played an important role in summarizing the main problems of legal proceedings in political cases. Modern science continues to study various aspects of the application of criminal procedure for counter-revolutionary crimes. Scientists are exploring in detail the role of the j judicial authorities in conducting mass repressions in Soviet Union the 1930-1950s. Individual problems of political justice are considered in detail: types of political processes, rehabilitation procedures, official forgery, cassation on political affairs, etc. There are separate areas of activity of the judicial authorities, directed against certain groups of the population: military, intellectuals, party-soviet officials, peasants, etc. Regional studies continue to appear, reflecting the role of the judicial authorities in mass repressions. Conclusions. The judicial authorities are considered generally in the context of the activities of all repressive bodies in modern legal and historical scientific literature; researches cover more and more regions of the former USSR and may lead to a complete picture of the special procedural law in political cases in Soviet Union in the 1930s-1950s.

N2  - The article analyses perceptions of the nature and extent of politicization by officials at eleven ministries of the Czech Republic. The empirical part of the article is based on a large-N inquiry among ministerial officials that were divided into four groups (directors of section, directors of department, heads of division, rank-and-file officials) following their work position. From the theory perspective, the article builds upon two types of politicization - formal and functional - with the latter further subdivided into hidden and partisan politicization. Such theoretical assumptions help towards formulating six hypotheses verified with relation to the four work positions. The corresponding analysis of officials' perceptions by position attests to a rather limited extent of the two main types of politicization with the exception of functional politicization of top management (director of section). Compared to the other three positions, directors of section show more proclivity to personal contacts (functional-hidden politicization) or to direct party political nomination (functional-partisan politicization). Unlike the conclusions of previous, largely expert or qualitative, inquiries, the officials' perceptions generally point towards rather moderate politicization of the Czech ministries without excessive direct influence of political representatives.

N2  - The paper presents the results of a large-N enquiry into the Czech Republic’s ministries based on two specific types of politicisation (functional, formal) and accounting for four types of work positions. The enquiry yielded the following findings: Functional politicisation of ministerial middle and lower management as well as rank-and-file positions is predominantly low. However, politically motivated appointments and promotions, executed through formal politicisation, pertain to ministerial high management positions. Overall, the enquiry suggests that Czech ministries are moderately politicised, showing a somewhat lesser degree of direct political influence than generally suspected.

N2  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the features and impact of performance management reforms implemented in the bureaucracies of several Asian states. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on government reports, reports of international bodies, and the data produced for various governance indicators, as well as scholarly analysis of performance management and new public management. Findings – After the 1997 Asian financial crisis, many Asian countries, including developed and developing, have introduced a variety of performance management systems into their bureaucracies. This has been encouraged by international agencies as part of their “good governance” agendas. Despite this, the goal of achieving efficient and workable public administration has still not been realized in many cases. Anti-corruption measures are not effective, and efficiency and service delivery in public organization has not significantly improved. However, political leaders must recognize that the building of rational legal bureaucracy in which patronage influence is reduced, creating networked governance, allowing engagement with civil society, and fostering high employee motivation, are the other prerequisites for achieving efficient and accountable government. Only then will performance management contribute to this aim. Originality/value – The value of this paper is to show that within the context of Asian bureaucracies, performance management is not a panacea to guarantee improvements in public administration. Other requirements are necessary, as indicated above, especially the creation of rational legal bureaucracy.

N2  - The concept of political interest groups in a political system presupposes two conditions. These are distinct setsof interests and values shared by groups or institutional memberships, and the existence of "conflict" in the system, that is, a modicum of tolerance for the public and private articulation of policy-relevant interests and values that are not necessarily those of the ruling elite. Among the focal topics of various studies of Soviet interest groups, the military establishment seems to be the most promising and, at the same time, the most difficult. As an interest group, the military tendsto be highly self-centered, competing with other groups for status, resources, and influence. The officer corps generally prefers a social planning policy that subordinates consumer interests to defense needs, urging large allocations to heavy industry. The military's basic interests may be broadly divided into two categories: "ideological" and functional.

N2  - There is a widespread consensus among the most important players in developed countries (voters, politicians, producers, traditional and green interest groups and bureaucracies) that a shift towards an eco-social market economy is essential for sustainable growth. Nevertheless, market-based instruments have not as yet been implemented satisfactorily in environmental policy. To identify the reasons for this insufficient implementation over the past decade, the Public Choice theory is used. The players' behavior is analyzed in order to show that their incentives for implementing market-based instruments in environmental policy, instead of command-and-control measures, are surprisingly weak. Knowing the obstacles to implementing market-based instruments provides valuable insight into how to overcome them.

N2  - The European Union (EU) has become increasingly visible and contested over the past decades. Several studies have shown that domestic pressure has made the EU's ‘electorally connected’ institutions more responsive. Yet, we still know little about how politicisation has affected the Union's non-majoritarian institutions. We address this question by focusing on agenda-setting and ask whether and how domestic politics influences the prioritisation of legislative proposals by the European Commission. We argue that the Commission, as both a policy-seeker and a survival-driven bureaucracy, will respond to domestic issue salience and Euroscepticism, at party, mass and electoral level, through targeted performance and through aggregate restraint. Building on new data on the prioritisation of legislative proposals under the ordinary legislative procedure (1999–2019), our analysis shows that the Commission's choice to prioritise is responsive to the salience of policy issues for Europe's citizens. By contrast, our evidence suggests that governing parties’ issue salience does not drive, and Euroscepticism does not constrain, the Commission's priority-setting. Our findings contribute to the literature on multilevel politics, shedding new light on the strategic responses of non-majoritarian institutions to the domestic politicisation of ‘Europe’.

N2  - Over-politicization co-exists in the Croatian public administration with legalism, formalism and red tape. Low reform, innovation and initiative capacities are among the results of such an administrative model. Croatia has a relatively big and strong but inefficient public administration. Internal bureaucratic resistance to modernization is observable. Foreign actors play a moderate role in administrative reform. The European Union has exerted the strongest influence on modernization on the basis of conditionality policy, insistence on the administrative capacity building, and the European Semester procedure. E-government policy, transparency, and strategic planning are the reform areas with the above-average reform results.

N2  - Work on judicial reform in the Kingdom of Poland began at the end of 1864 amid the aftermath of the defeated January 1863 uprising and the resulting gradual abolition of the country’s legal and political separation from Russia. It was decided that the Russian Judicial Laws of 1864 were to be implemented in the Kingdom, yet all of their solutions providing for the society’s participation in administering justice were removed during the twelve years long legislative process. Jury trial was abandoned, the election of justices of the peace replaced with their appointment, and the irremovability of judges was severely restricted. Also, the bar did not receive any autonomy. The goal behind the judicial reform in the Kingdom was not only unifying its judiciary with that of Russia but also its Russification. Russian became the official language of the courts and the newly appointed judges were to be Russian lawyers. On the other hand, an undeniable improvement was brought about by the introduction of Russian civil and criminal procedure in the Kingdom. The former remained in force in the central and eastern parts of the independent Polish state until 1933 and the latter - until 1929.

N2  - We focus on the European Quarter in Brussels as a political place and the spatial context of European Union (EU) policy making. In addition to the EU institutions, the political place consists of a political agglomeration of various kinds of actors, from EU bureaucrats and politicians to a variety of stakeholders and lobbyists from all over the EU, who are permanently present in the Brussels neighbourhood. We present, firstly, the EU Quarter as a fixed setting for policy making with a relatively constant physical, locational and functional shape, and a specific sense of place as the EU bubble. Secondly, we emphasise the fragmentation and fluidity that portray it as a place divided into various political assemblages that make the place an assemblage of assemblages consisting of smaller and constantly evolving sub-processes. Thirdly, we aim to demonstrate the mobile and geographically distributed nature of EU policy making, and thus the dispersal of the political places where it takes place. This generates mobility of different kinds, which include not only the circulation of political ideas and people between different sites of the EU political system, but also the monthly migration of the Parliament and related lobbyists to Strasbourg. We believe that these three aspects of political place help the understanding of the situated but simultaneously spatially dispersed and mobile nature of EU policy making, and the study of the political places in other urban contexts.

N2  - Finland has performed consistently well in international comparisons of successful, future-oriented environmental policy. This success seems to emanate from strategies, which penetrate the country's governance structure. We examine the factors underlying the success of progressive environmental policy in Finland. We describe the evolution of long-term environmental policy in Finland, and then, focusing on 24 indepth interviews, we explain why the long-term policy persists, even when subjected to the pressures of traditional drivers associated with short-term politics, such as elections, political parties and interest groups. The interviewees are high-ranking makers of environmental policy who represent varying interests, including politicians, public officials, policy scientists, representatives for key interest groups and large companies. We find that the main enablers of future-oriented environmental policy are international commitments, semi-autonomous public administration and preparatory processes that include all relevant stakeholders. While our findings suggest that a successful long-term environmental policy endures primarily because of strategic forces that operate outside the immediate control of the institutions of representative democracy, the system relies on the support of governing majorities, which may also affect implementation. This study enhances our understanding of the factors that facilitate long-term policy-making and offers pragmatic evidence of how future-oriented environmental policy can be implemented.

N2  - This paper analyses the career backgrounds of local government officials in provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs) in China and explains the appointment patterns of Chinese EPB bureaucrats. Using biographical information of provincial EPB heads and drawing on fieldwork conducted in Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia, this paper finds that only one-fourth of the provincial EPB heads were promoted through the bureau ranks within the EPBs, while the remaining three-fourths were appointed from positions outside the environment field. Further, nearly all EPB heads' professional backgrounds and associated networks can be clearly categorized as environmental, business, provincial government, or local government oriented. This paper delineates these four types of Chinese EPB leaders and explains why an awareness of the different professional orientations is critical to understanding environmental regulation and protection in China. These findings have implications for inferring the unique characteristics of a province's EPB leadership, the implementation capacities of provincial EPBs, and the appointment preferences of provincial leaders.

N2  - This paper analyses Chinese sub-national governments' implementation strategies to meet national energy efficiency targets in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010). Previous research has focused on the ways governance practices and decision-making structures shape implementation outcomes, yet very little attention has been given to what strategies local leaders actually employ to bridge national priorities with local interests. To illustrate how local leaders work politically, this paper highlights specific implementation methods officials use to strengthen formal incentives and create effective informal incentives to comply with energy efficiency mandates. The analysis is drawn from 53 interviews conducted in June and July of 2010 in Shanxi, a major coal-producing and energy-intensive province. Findings suggest that local government leaders conform to national directives by ``bundling{''} the energy efficiency policy with policies of more pressing local importance or by ``bundling{''} their energy efficiency objectives with the interests of groups with significant political influence. Ultimately, sub-national government officials frame policies in ways that give them legitimacy at the local level.

N2  - This article examines the career backgrounds of municipal Chinese Communist Party secretaries between 1990 and 2011. Based on an analysis of 898 cadre biographies and 32 interviews with local government officials during 2011 and 2013, this article shows that the majority of municipal party secretaries had spent their careers working at the provincial and municipal levels, while only few advanced up from the county. Our analysis finds that obstacles hindering leading county cadres from rising to the upper ranks of the municipal apparatus include age and education restrictions; limited positions at the municipal level; the lack of networks linking to provincial leaders; and provincial leaders’ appointment preferences. Limited career advancement opportunities for county cadres have important implications for understanding the incentive foundations of China’s bureaucracy. With only slim prospects for leading county cadres to rise to top municipal positions, the political incentives outlined in the cadre evaluation system might not be as effective in steering cadre behavior as currently claimed in the literature.

N2  - One of the key drivers of modern and efficient public administration under the good governance doctrine is an efficient top officials' selection system. A targeted selection and recruitment system is a prerequisite for the whole administration to act in compliance with the political priorities of the government. However, civil servants and top officials alike must put professional competencies above political loyalty. Therefore, a new system was introduced in Slovenia following the 2003 Civil Servants Act, aimed at ensuring professionalism against (over)politicization of public administration. A research carried out in 2012 among candidates and selected top officials and ministers, as their political superiors, revealed an overall efficiency of the Slovenian selection scheme in the sense of restricted over-politicization and increased professionalism. Its outcomes lead to the conclusion that the selection system in Slovenia, owing to its two-phase professional and political selection, is most adequate in terms of both regulation and practice since it takes into account the twofold role of top officials and civil service or public administration as a whole (first, as a force providing professional solutions by ensuring legality and efficient resource management, and second, as the closest collaborators of the political leadership implementing government policies).

N2  - In the light of the increasing political influence on German universities (amongst others, the excellence initiative) with effects on the selection of top positions, this article examines the appointment of chairs (department heads) in a ``small{''} surgical specialty during the last 30 years. Following the delineation of official indicators of competence (inclusion criteria) within an appointment procedure, it can be shown that a broad distribution of institutions and persons that meet these criteria exists. The empirical examination of the actually successful occupations shows that closure mechanisms play a role because the successful candidates stem from no more than 10 out of 34 clinical departments. The monetary capital in terms of third-party funds is the most important allocation criterion, but cannot sufficiently explain the way appointments take place. As there are candidates who in formal terms are in a wide measure equally qualified, and a consequential uncertainty of the basis of decision within an appointment procedure, the derivation of the candidate in terms of a personal relationship to a chair holder (department head) from whose clinic he applies and who acts as a patron, proves to be the decisive distinction following the examination of all inclusion criteria. This results in a reproduction of the chair holders (department heads) largely from the same clinical departments and the formation of an academic caste system. In perspective, this cartel-like closure appears to be getting increasingly worse.

N2  - Interest groups participate in the political process in a variety of ways. They can lobby the legislature, interact with elected and administrative executive officials, and participate in litigation either as a litigant or an amicus curiae. But the literature is scarce in exploring how interest groups behave when their stakeholders dissent. This study explores the actions by one interest group, the American Bar Association (ABA), in participating in “notice and comment” rulemaking by the Department of Labor where the ABA did not represent the legal profession. It finds that the ABA engaged in astroturfing, and that their efforts were ignored by the Department. This suggests that astroturfing may not be useful in the notice and comment rulemaking process, because the agency's unitary status allows them to discern the centralized origin of the comments. This finding is confirmed by comparing the ABA's influence on the Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush, when it did represent the consensus of the legal profession.

N2  - This study focuses on ad hoc policy advisory committees that bring together experts and stakeholders to propose public policies on the basis of consensus. These kinds of committees are often considered to be a typical governance mechanism of the social democratic model of regulation and policy-making known from the Nordic countries. We challenge this view by comparing the Norwegian system of committee governance with those of Germany and the European Union and point out the central role of coordination and consensus in all three systems. Relying on existing and original research, and contrary to the assumption of a distinct Nordic regime, we find significant similarities between the three committee governance systems when it comes to organisational features, the kind of expertise produced and the committees’ governance functions. Most remarkable is the prevalence of hybrid, tripartite committees that draw together interest groups, civil servants and researchers in all three systems. We show that these kinds of ad hoc advisory committees tend to generate a kind of coordinated, negotiated expertise where notions of validity and objectivity are connected not only to cognitive quality but also to the breadth of viewpoints that are integrated. Moreover, the Nordic committee system of Norway stands out with only few distinctive qualities, and it is not obvious how the notion of ‘social democracy’ helps illuminating these features. To help shed light on the striking resemblances we find across systems, we develop a notion of consensus-oriented political and epistemological systems, which may be a useful complement to the notion of Nordic social democracy.

N2  - Because of its combination of patronage and a constitution based on parliamentary democracy and semi-presidentialism, the Icelandic political system can perhaps best be characterised as 'ambiguous'. Together with other trends, such as globalisation in general and a growing European-wide legalism, the European Economic Area (EEA) has already had a strong impact on Icelandic politics. The EEA is largely about delegation without accountability, which means that there has been a significant loss of sovereignty to EU institutions. However, the EEA has also meant a move towards a clearer demarcation of political roles, which has in fact increased the autonomy of the parliament (the Althing) vis-a-vis the cabinet. The separation of roles between cabinet ministers and civil servants has also become more clear-cut. In sum, while the Iccland-EU relationship Lends to make national politics more diffuse, the EEA has also made some of the domestic principal-agent relationships more transparent. © 2000 Frank Cass & Co.

N2  - This article explores the multilingual and multicultural aspects of community-building, networking and communication in the European Union's (EU) political and administrative system. We investigated the networking and communicative preferences of EU civil servants and lobbyists using survey data and thematic interviews. Our aim was to gain a deeper insight into the ways formal and informal language policies correspond to perceptions and practices of multilingualism among our target group. On a general level, we also explored how decisive the role of multilingualism is in the EU's administration and among lobbyists. We hypothesized that the social and working environment in Brussels, along with the growing use of (Euro)-English contributes to the construction of the cosmopolitan identities of EU civil servants and lobbyists. The findings indicate that although multilingualism appears across the different social contexts under investigation, all of these contexts are heavily dominated by (Euro-) English. Further, in their professional interactions the respondents are highly aware of the relationship of language(s) to power and they prefer the usage of languages that are more power-neutral in their actual setting even if this comes with the cost of mutual unintelligibility. The findings imply that multilingualism plays a less significant role in the social and working lives of Brussels based civil servants and lobbyists than previously assumed (cf. Phillipson, 2003).

N2  - The shock of war is thought to be closely associated with the growth of the state, in the United States and elsewhere. Yet each proposal to significantly expand state power in the United States since September 11 has been resisted, restrained, or even rejected outright. This outcome - theoretically unexpected and contrary to conventional wisdom - is the result of enduring aspects of America's domestic political structure: the separation of powers at the federal level between three co-equal and overlapping branches, the relative ease with which interest groups access the policy-making process, and the intensity with which executive-branch bureaucracies guard their organizational turf. These persistent aspects of U.S. political life, designed by the nation's founders to impede the concentration of state power, have substantially shaped the means by which contemporary guardians of the American state pursue ``homeland security''. War does make the state, but not as it pleases. Theoretical approaches to state building should recognize that domestic political institutions mediate between the international shock of war and domestic state building.

N2  - In 2007, the Senate began using pro forma sessions in an attempt to curtail the President's recess-appointment power. On January 4, 2012, President Obama challenged the propriety of pro forma sessions by issuing four recess appointments. Due to the nature of the appointments, a constitutional challenge appears evident. This Note addresses the constitutional validity of the appointments, taking into account the constitutional and historical framework of recess appointments and evaluating both the short- and long-term effects of a resolution. This Note recommends a bright-line approach in which recess appointments are valid when the Senate has failed to meet a quorum and has conducted no official business for four consecutive days.

N2  - With the introduction of the Health Insurance Act in 2006 in the Netherlands, the basic package of the former sickness funds became valid for all citizens. The basic benefit package has been subject to change, responding to increasing health care expenditures, medical innovations and the economic crisis. In this paper we address the decision criteria used to assess the package annually since 2006 and describe some developments that do not follow the criteria, leading to a yo-yo effect. We discuss the formation of the decision for in- or exclusion and why some treatments seem to follow an, at first sight, arbitrary in- and exclusion pathway. We first describe the official way of establishing the basic benefit package and than will describe why some treatments follow a deviated path. We conclude that political pressure and pressure from interest groups may lead to inclusion or postponement of exclusion. Reform of the organization of certain forms of health care (in our example mental care) may lead to seemingly inconsequent changes. The yo-yo effect of some treatments or pharmaceuticals may have negative effects on health care providers, insurers and patients. The seemingly well defined criteria available for defining the basic package appear to be broadly interpretable and other influences may determine the final decision of inclusion or exclusion.

N2  - Using official statistics, bureaucratic registers and ethnographic material collected from the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) from six districts across six Indian states, the article explains under what conditions the capacity of last-mile bureaucracy matters for the performance of pro-poor welfare programmes in the Indian federal polity. In seeking to address the presence of heterogenous welfare outcomes in the districts of India, the article underscores the salience of last-mile bureaucrats and the extent to which the politicization of redistributive struggles might contribute to local state capacity to deliver welfare services, a hitherto under-researched aspect in comparative social development research. Challenging the conventional thesis that only a strong autonomous state succeeds in implementing welfare programmes, the article further argues that effective policy implementation can occur within the peculiar environment of relatively low-capacity last-mile bureaucracies even in the face of adverse socioeconomic circumstances. In short, the article shifts attention to the understudied relationship between the capacity of last-mile bureaucracy and welfare outcomes in India.

N2  - Aim: This study explored factors that shaped the development of Australia's Health Star Rating system for front-of-pack labelling (FoPL) on packaged foods and whether insights could be drawn from this experience to inform the development of global FoPL standards. Methods: Ten individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with public health or consumer advocates, academics in the field of nutrition labelling and policy, a food industry employee, and Australian public servants. Thematic analysis was undertaken, guided by Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework, to identify factors which shaped Australian and international FoPL policy processes. Results: Senior Australian bureaucrats played the policy entrepreneur role to facilitate the development of the Health Star Rating system. The public health and consumer advocacy groups formed an alliance to counter-balance the influence of the food industry in the Health Star Rating development process. Public health and consumer groups have less influence at Codex Alimentarius, where policy-making is constrained by political alliances and consensus voting structures. Conclusions: Strong leadership, policy entrepreneurship and a coherent alliance between public health and consumer groups enabled the development of a FoPL system in Australia and could contribute to advancing FoPL standards at the international level.

N2  - The 'Academy of Family Physicians of India (AFPI)', is a non-profit organisation registered in New Delhi with a membership base, spread over all India. AFPI is working towards the establishment of a distinct academic discipline 'family medicine' for doctors pursuing primary care vocation within the mainstream medical education system in India. AFPI adopted a multi-pronged approach engaging political leadership, bureaucracy, higher judiciary and other stakeholders. In 2018, a public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court of India. In pursuance to the Supreme Court of India order, AFPI approached the ministry as well as the Medical Council of India. In 2018 we had received written assurance from the Prime Minister's Office - PMO that the family medicine discipline will be addressed in the NMC bill. Earlier family medicine was mentioned only as part of the National Health Policies (NHP 2002 and NHP 2017) and finally, it has become part of the act, the National Medical Commission Act 2019.

N2  - The article proposes a systems-theoretical approach to political clientelism. It places political clientelism in the theoretical framework of a democratic political system characterized by internal differentiation in government and bureaucracy, party politics and a politically relevant public. Against the background of existing research on the link between democracy and political clientelism, it uses Luhmann's concept of power and more specifically his model of the formal and the informal power cycle to point out parallels and differences between a political system based on expectations with regard to policies and a political system in which clientelistic expectations prevail. Democratic political systems are based on formal, legally codified power and informal power. Clientelistic power is a special form of informal power affecting this interplay, as the example of democratization in Mexico shows. Political systems with clientelistic expectations differ from those with a policy orientation with regard to the complexity of policies, the generalization of political support, the bases for personalization, the pattern of interest articulation and the most prominent external influences on the system.

N2  - In the wake of the 2011 uprisings, Tunisian, Egyptian and Yemeni diplomats faced unprecedented questions regarding their professional conduct. The foreign policy institutions of all three countries witnessed new forms of political agency, with diplomats beginning to question, debate and (re)define routine practices and norms. Combining diplomatic theory with the multidisciplinary literature on state bureaucracies, this article analyses the various strategies that diplomats developed during a time marked by radical politicisation, strong emotion and new opportunities. On a conceptual level, it emphasises the concept of 'diplomatic discretion', which remains under-theorised in diplomacy research today, but is crucial to the study of diplomatic practice. Empirically, this article draws on ethnographic data regarding diplomats' lived experiences, treating their narratives surrounding the 2011 events as a starting point of analysis.

N2  - Context: This article explains the policy process that occasioned the development of comprehensive tobacco control policies in Mauritius from 1980 to 2019. It does so by drawing theoretical insights from John Kingdon's streams framework, historical institutionalism, and ideational perspectives to explicate how tobacco control rose to the status of government policy agenda. Methods: The main sources of data are government documents, media reports, archival studies, grey literature, and published books and articles. These sources were supplemented by key informant interviews with government officials, civil society groups, and other vested interest groups. Findings: This article finds that the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases in the late 1980s, the political commitment of Mauritius's Labour government to comprehensive tobacco control, the institutional legacies of Mauritius's Public Health Act of 1925, and the administrative capacity of Mauritius's Ministry of Health and Quality of Life are the primary factors that drove tobacco control policies in Mauritius. Conclusion: The findings from this study will enrich our understanding of policy change and the politics of tobacco control in the global south. Future research should investigate why some countries in Africa have failed to adopt comprehensive tobacco control policies despite ratifying the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

N2  - In a post-Cold War era characterised by globalisation and deep interdependence, the actions of national governments increasingly have an effect beyond their own territorial borders. Moreover, key agents of global governance-international organisations and their bureaucracies, non-state actors and private agents-exercise pervasive forms of authority. Due to these shifts, it is widely noted that world politics suffers from a democratic deficit. This article contributes to work on global democracy by looking at the role of international courts. Building upon an original dataset covering the 24 international courts in existence since the end of the Second World War, we argue that international courts are able to advance democratic values and shape democratic practices beyond the state. They can do so by fostering equal participation, accountability, and public justification that link individuals directly with sites of transnational authority. We contend that the ability of international courts to promote these values is conditioned by institutional design choices concerning access rules, review powers, and provisions regarding judicial reason-giving. We canvass these design features of different international courts and assess the promises and pitfalls for global democratisation. We conclude by linking our analysis of international courts and global democratisation with debates about the legitimation and politicisation of global governance at large.

N2  - Korea recently introduced three major health care reforms: in financing (1999), pharmaceuticals (2000), and provider payment (2001). In these three reforms, new government policies merged more than 350 health insurance societies into a single payer, separated drug prescribing by physicians from dispensing by pharmacists, and attempted to introduce a new prospective payment system. This essay compares the three reforms in Korea and draws important lessons about the country's changing process and politics of health care policy. The change of government, the president's keen interest in health policy, and democratization in the public policy process toward a more pluralist context opened a policy window for reform. Civic groups played an active role in the policy process by shaping the proposals for reform-a major change from the previous policy process that was dominated by government bureaucrats. The three reforms also showed important differences in the role of interest groups. Strong Support by the rural population and labor unions contributed to the financing reform. In the pharmaceutical reform, which was a big threat to physician income, the president and civic groups succeeded in quickly setting the reform agenda; the medical profession was unable to block the adoption of the reform but their strikes influenced the content of the reform during implementation. Physician strikes also helped block the implementation of the payment reform. Future reform efforts in Korea will need to consider the political management of vested interest groups and the design of strategies for both scope and sequencing of policy reforms.

N2  - The Chief Executive's (CE's) relationship with Beijing is bound to entail a patron-client network, for Beijing has to confirm, endorse and announce the CE's official appointment after a local electoral process where the CE is elected by the 800-man Election Committee, a 'small circle' electoral method that is favourable to maintain patron-client relations. In other words, a skilful manipulation of patron-client relations can help to secure electoral success. Still, the candidate has to build up a stable reciprocal relationship with the voters to consolidate their sense of client list recognition to maintain loyalties by means of offering material or non-material benefits the clients need, or even seeking assistance from the patron Beijing. Nevertheless, such exchange of benefits sometimes may not be so successful as to earn the loyalties of all, especially the pro-democracy and voters with different political ideology. Further, the dyadic relations and loyalties of a patron's clients can shift between patrons so that one's patron can also become another's client, like the incumbent CE Donald Tsang who is the client of Beijing but also the patron of all his political appointees, and the former CE Tung Chee-hwa, who was the client of Beijing especially the former President Jiang Zemin, but Tung himself was the patron of many Hong Kong elites coopted to the various institutions and positions. Finally, Beijing's obsession with maintaining effective of indirect control over the HKSAR polity by ordaining the actual choice of a CE and hence the resulting non-contested CE elections of 2002 and 2005 in which open nominations of CE candidates were conducted but the secret balloting for the qualified candidates was not held at all. In short, while voters may become the clients of Beijing, candidates may also seek to become the client list supporter of the central government. Patron-client relation is arguably the hallmark of the insider politics in CE elections.

N2  - This article examines the role played by local governments in shaping
resistance to reforming fiscally and environmentally disastrous fuel
subsidies. Shifting from universal-access social programs, like fuel
subsidies, to targeted programs requires vesting authority with local
politicians and bureaucrats, whom the state relies on to identify poor
households and to deliver benefits. Where local governments are corrupt,
citizens find promises to replace fuel subsidies with targeted spending
less credible and resistance to reform is higher. Using household survey
data from Indonesia, this article finds that corruption in the
implementation of targeted transfer programs increases resistance to
fuel subsidy reform among the poor citizens who consume the least fuel
and who stand to benefit the most from targeted programs. Findings
suggest that improving capacity within subnational governments to
deliver social programs is important in developing public support for
reform.

N2  - One key step in the process of development is the transition from the personalistic rules and privileges that characterise developing societies to open access orders and rational-legal bureaucracies sustaining impersonal rules. This article uses a micro-data set of Spanish officers to study the politicisation of the army during the Second Republic (1931-1939) taking Franco's Africanist faction as the case study. The military reforms during 1931-1933 increased the impersonality of rules determining the promotion of officers, but executive discretionary powers persisted. The results suggest that changes in the government affected the dynamics of the army. Under conservative governments (1934-1935), Africanists were promoted more rapidly. Centre-left governments during the period of 1931-1933 did not systematically promote Africanists differently, but the revision of promotions in 1933 slowed their careers. The politicisation of the army was one of the factors contributing to the military coup that started the Spanish Civil War. Copyright © 2019 Instituto Figuerola, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

N2  - Societal well-being is challenged by the complexity and intangibility of the compromises inherent in digital exchanges. Increasingly these exchanges rely on technology, with competing priorities that challenge cooperation and communication among key parties involved. The authors examine the factors that drive tensions between consumers and organizations in digital exchanges, as well as how and why interest groups, lawmakers, and bureaucrats (also known as the “iron triangle”) try to mediate these exchanges through policy and regulation. By explicating the nature of these relationships, the authors illustrate various trade-offs faced by all parties and depict a novel, comprehensive framework to facilitate holistic assessment of the factors underlying these ubiquitous but complex digital relationships with vague ethical stewardship. This framework serves as a lens to help guide business and regulatory policymaking and as a platform for identifying future research opportunities. © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - This article proposes a political economy of privatization in eastern Europe during the transition period. The normative, standard hypothesis of a welfare state is contrasted with a much more realistic conception based on an imperfect state. Thanks to this hypothesis, a positive analysis is made of the behavior of the political actors involved in defining and implementing public privatization policies. National privatization strategies are made endogenous by taking them to be dependent on existing interactions between political actors and pressure groups. Initial political choices made about privatization have affected the way economic reforms have been carried out, as the new elite produced by privatization has sped up or blocked reforms as a function of its own interests. Questions are raised about the factors that could, in the definition of public policies during the transition era, limit both the margin of maneuver for elected officials and the influence of pressure groups.

N2  - The aim of this article introduces the establishment of non-governmental organizations (NGOS) in the Czech Republic. They belong to interest groups, are interested in generally beneficial issues, are not directly part of the structure of government and act independently of it. The West European countries have begun to recognize the positive role and impact of NGOs over the course of the 90s. The result has been a shift from the concept of government" to the concept of "governance". The tool for governance is a civic dialogue, which develops participative democracy, i.e. the possibility to express and participate in the decision-making process during the election period. Economists describe the civil sector as the environment responsible for expanding the wealth of a society. Non-governmental non-profit organizations add a new perspective and guide the reactions of both local needs and problems as well as issues of a global character at the turn of the 21st century. A rigid centralized system in the post communist countries has been largely replaced by a bureaucracy lacking both experience and finances to create a truly democratic alternative. The main problems of these countries is a deficit of rules of communication with the interest groups (NGOs included), limited power (capacity) of state institutions and no clear lines between state activities and civil society. although almost 20 years have passed since the fall of the totalitarian state in the Czech Republic, the rebirth of civil society has been and continues to be, a painful and long-term process. Non-profit organizations have been declared by public administration as partners and colleagues, but in practice this is still not an equal relationship. What is missing here is a clear vision supported by social consensus regarding the role of the state in Czech society, or what function the state should perform.

N2  - First published in 1998, this volume has been a significant contribution to current debates over the future of the public services. Professionalism has been and is a major feature of the British welfare state. Yet the political, social and economic context in which the profession emerged and flourished is changing rapidly. The professional ideal of disinterested expertise serving the public interest has lost much of its original gloss. Professional status and careers are threatened by major shifts in the structure of the welfare state which can be summed up as the decline of the big government bureaucratic model. Professions themselves face challenges to their special claims to expertise and public service from: politicians, senior managers, new social movements and pressure groups, technological change and not least from those citizens whom they aspire to serve. This volume asks how these new challenges are changing professions and how professionals themselves are adapting. © Martin Laffin 1998. All rights reserved.

N2  - Despite political obstacles and the likelihood of perverse short-term socio-economic effects, at least five of the South Asian countries-Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and India-have embarked on adjustment programmes in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the adoption and implementation of these reform measures vary across the South Asian region in terms of (a) time schedule, (b) sectoral coverage, (c) intensity and (d) sustainability. In other words, these countries are in different phases of economic reform programmes. The process and speed of reforms depended, at least in the last decade or so, on the nature of political regimes and the outlook of the politicians holding key positions, degree of robustness of the economy in question, size and outlook of bureaucracy and other organs of governance, articulation by pressure and interest groups including the private sector and the trade unions and more critically the perception of the international institutions like the World Bank and the IMF. The impact of economic reforms have also been varying in terms of their visibility, nature and extent. As these countries intensify the process of liberalization and privatization, a changed regional profile is expected to emerge. Two relevant questions will, therefore, inevitably preoccupy the minds of South Asians. Will South Asia be as vibrant as the NICs, or robust enough to be able to develop a new paradigm of development for itself? Will the search for self-reliance, alleviation of poverty and social emancipation be given up or will it precariously hang between insolvency and subserviency? This article focuses on the concerns and vulnerabilities rather than the positive and optimistic aspects of globalization.

Its main thesis is, that there is an increasing politicization of education administration. This means mixing functions, which are originally separated according to bureaucracy theory. After describing the bureaucratic relationship between education politics and education administration, the expectations are outlined, which are ascribed to education administration within the current school system management. Subsequently, the development of the administrative politicization thesis is shown empirically. Finally, the administrative politicization and thus a new ``addressing policy{''} is accentuated as one of the central structural problems of the new school system management.

N2  - In 2005, after many years of inaction, the Canadian government seemed poised to make real changes to national childcare policy-a marker of social movement success for the grassroots Childcare Advocacy Association of Canada (CCAAC). In this paper, we analyse childcare policy developments in Canada between 2003 and 2005, drawing on qualitative interviews conducted with CCAAC staff and members, allies from other national childcare organizations, and former elected government officials and policy makers. Given its role as a grassroots social movement organization and not a professional association (which can be more closely aligned with governments), we hypothesized that the CCAAC would take a conflictual approach to the federal government's policy initiative. Our close analysis of interviews with CCAAC staff, their allies and elected government officials and civil servants instead reveals conflictual and cooperative relations (Giugni and Passy, In: From contention to democracy. Lanham, MD, Rowman & Littlefield. 1998) during this important period. Our discussion explores some possible conditions in the sociopolitical environment and the internal structure of CCAAC that account for this conflictual-cooperation SMO-government relationship from 2003 to 2005.

On the one hand they focus on the privileged access of a few groups in balkanized issue niches, and on the other they observe highly inclusive lobbying campaigns where hundreds of lobbyists vigorously compete for policymakers' attention. Not surprisingly, these disparate observations lead to contradictory conclusions about lobbying tactics, relations with relevant policymakers and the nature of interest group influence. In this article, we make a simple, yet novel, empirical observation: these seemingly incongruent observations of lobbying at the micro level are not inconsistent when we uncover the structure of lobbyists' interactions at the macro level. That is, both views are correct, depending on the policy context. Using data from 248 543 Lobbying Disclosure Act reports filed between 1998 and 2008 - which consists of 1 557 526 observations of 32 700 individual lobbyists reporting activity in 78 issue areas - we reveal that the Washington lobbying community has a fundamental and stable core-periphery structure. We then document how the empirically derived core-periphery mapping is a superior way to differentiate bandwagon or niche policy domains. As transaction cost theory suggests, we find that policy domains in the core have more in-house lobbyists and more revolving door lobbyists. And, on average, lobbyists active in core domains represent a greater diversity of interests and tend to be policy generalists. The converse is also true. Highly specialized contract lobbyists drift toward those sparsely populated domains in the periphery where they may focus on obscure policy minutiae, relatively free from public scrutiny. Our findings have important implications for the study of lobbying and interest representation. In Washington, there are really two worlds of lobbying. The first world, where most lobbying attention is directed, is one in which we see a great deal of interconnectedness and interest diversity. The second world, home to an overwhelming majority of policy domains, cultivates niche lobbying and policy balkanization. That these two worlds exist simultaneously is precisely why observers fail to agree on what 'typical' or 'average' lobbying is. We believe that this is why the political science literature on interest groups have been contradictory for so long. The abstract core-periphery structure we uncover also has important practical implications for influence in Washington. At first glance, those highly competitive policy domains in the core appear to embody the pluralistic ideal. However, we show that these conditions give interest groups the incentive to hire revolving door lobbyists, who sell access to former employers - not highly specialized expertise - at a premium. Existing lobbying disclosure and revolving door regulations do little to level the playing field. Washington's most powerful interests know they need to staff up with large numbers of former government officials if they want to stick out in the crowd. Indeed, it appears to be one of the most effective ways to find a seat at the center of the conversation.

N2  - Although experience inside the halls of power afford lobbyists valuable political, policy and procedural skills that can improve the deliberative process, it also gives them privileged access to former employers that others do not have. Washington's revolving door evokes legitimate ethical concerns, such as when former legislators resign their seats to take lucrative jobs representing the very industries they regulate. However, social scientists know surprisingly little about the revolving door beyond such sensational, albeit important, cases. To shed more light on the broader phenomenon, we systematically explore the revolving door on a large scale to answer a simple question: Do revolving door lobbyists represent different interests than conventional lobbyists? If, as revolving door proponents imply, these lobbyists work on behalf of organized interests solely for their specialized subject-matter expertise, then we would expect them to represent clienteles that are no different than conventional lobbyists. Alternatively, if they represent a wider variety of economic interests than conventional lobbyists then we assume they are hired more for their ability to get a foot in the door than to serve as policy expert adjuncts to government. Using evidence from original data on the professional biographies of roughly 1600 registered lobbyists - which we link to data from almost 50 000 quarterly Lobbying Disclosure Act reports - we expose a significant transparency loophole in the law. Because lobbyists are not required to continuously disclose their 'covered official' status - the statutory definition of revolving door - periodic lobbying disclosure reports effectively hide the revolving door from public scrutiny. Instead, we rely on our more comprehensive information on lobbyists' connections to previous employers to more accurately measure the size and scope of Washington's revolving door, and to investigate how these connections affect which interests they represent. We find that revolving door lobbyists have worked mostly in Congress, tend to work as contract lobbyists rather than in-house government-relations staff and are more likely to specialize in lobbying for appropriations earmarks. Then, after controlling for a variety of lobbying specializations, we show that former members of Congress are no more likely than other lobbyists to attract a more economically diverse set of clients than their conventionallobbyist counterparts. However, congressional staffers who had worked their way up the organizational ladder on Capitol Hill do. We infer that well-connected congressional staffers who spin through the revolving door sell access to key decision makers in Congress, not their industry- or issue-specific technical or substantive expertise. Simply, the revolving door problem is not limited to a handful of headline-catching former legislators, is much bigger than the existing lobbying disclosure regime reveals and - most importantly - significantly distorts the representation of interests before government. The practical implications are clear: lobbying transparency rules, cooling-off periods and other restrictions are insufficient disincentives. Interest group demand for access is simply too strong. We advocate enhancing lobbying transparency by expanding the statutory definitions of lobbying activities, requiring lobbyists to disclose more details about government employment and shifting some of the disclosure burden to democratically accountable government officials themselves.

N2  - In 1936, while Sweden gave birth to one of the most peaceful solutions to class conflict (i.e., the neo-corporatist welfare state), Spain gave birth to one of the most violent outcomes of class conflict: the Spanish Civil War. Why did the political and socio-economic elites choose collaboration in Sweden and violent confrontation in Spain? This article underlines an overlooked intervening factor: the organization of the bureaucracy. In the late 19th century, semi-authoritarian Sweden created a meritocratic autonomous bureaucracy. In contrast, Spain-where executive and administrative positions were frequently accountable to parliamentary dynamics-built a patronage-based administration. The result was that the ruling Swedish Left could not offer public offices to core supporters and had to restrict its policies to satisfy the (more collaborationist) demands of its "policy-seekers," while the ruling Spanish Left, thanks to the ample margin of maneuver it enjoyed to appoint and promote state officials, could satisfy the (more confrontational) demands of its "office-seekers." © The Author(s) 2013.

N2  - Deciding the character and level of official patronage of religion are fundamental questions for all states. Yet we know next to nothing about the determinants of such patronage. Are democratic governments more or less inclined than autocratic ones to seek legitimacy through religious patronage? Is it ultimately ideological struggles that determine the extent of government backing of religion? This article addresses these questions through an analysis of the evolution of the state’s role as patron and protector of Buddhism (and other officially recognized religions) in Thailand. Specifically, it examines changes in government expenditure on Thailand’s religious bureaucracy from 1960 to 2016. It finds that democratization and ideological struggles have been the main drivers of a significant expansion of government spending on religious patronage. .

N2  - Severe capacity gaps continue to constrain effective urban management in Ghana, despite numerous donor-supported training programmes. This paper examines the nature of these capacity gaps and analyses specifically the factors contributing to the low attraction and retention of local government staff: politicisation of the bureaucracy, excessive use of external experts, excessive state intervention in skill development and low remuneration of local government staff. Against this background, the paper reviews critically a recent capacity building initiative: the establishment of the (new) Institute of Local Government Studies in Accra. Suggestions to improve capacity building for urban management in Ghana are offered. These include the need to prepare a coherent strategy to guide and co-ordinate stakeholder inputs in capacity building; to place training in the context of institutional development; and encourage the development and use of local expertise in donor assisted projects; and, promote merit-based remuneration of local government staff.

N2  - Until the end of the Cold War the UK intelligence services were not officially acknowledged, and their personnel were banned from entering the public sphere. From 1989 the UK government began to put the intelligence services on a legal footing and to release the identity of the heads of the intelligence agencies. Since then, public engagement by the intelligence agencies has gathered pace. What this article hypothesises is that there is now, in the UK, an effective intelligence lobby of former insiders who engage in the public sphere - using on the record briefings - to counter criticism of the intelligence community and to promote a narrative and vision of what UK intelligence should do, how it is supported and how oversight is conducted. Content analysis and framing models of non-broadcast coverage of intelligence debates, focusing on the 36 months after the Snowden revelations, confirm an active and rolling lobby of current and former intelligence officials. The paper concludes that the extent of the lobby's interventions in the public sphere is a matter for debate and possible concern.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the state of government accounting in Ghana and Benin using neo-patrimonial and organizational façade lenses. Design/methodology/approach: The study used two country case studies that engaged with stakeholders including donors, civil society, politicians, and civil servants. Semi-structured interviews were used as the main data collection technique, which were complemented by document analysis. Findings: The study finds that government accounting reforms are decoupled and used in both countries as a façade which is caused, to a varying degree, by indigenous neo-patrimonial governance traits of informal institutions, patronage, and clientelism. And despite the relatively superior Ghanaian system, in terms of its functioning, compared to the Beninese, government accounting plays a more symbolic role in the former than in the latter. Originality/value: This is one of the very few theoretically informed empirical studies that examine the state of government accounting in the two major African settings – Anglophone and Francophone. The results inform policies more tailored to indigenous governance issues for better outcomes. © 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - The Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) are required to act as a corner stone in the public financial management system to prevent and discourage corruption by enhancing transparency, accountability and good governance. However, the executives and legislative arms of government in most of the African countries have reportedly overpowered the independence of SAI due to certain factors. Therefore, this study examines the factors hindering the independence of SAIs towards good governance in the Nigerian public sector. The primary data were collected from senior and management officers in the office of the Auditor General for the Federation and Public Account Committees of the National Assembly through self-administered questionnaire. One hundred and fifty (150) questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The statistical analysis tool employed in this study is Structural Equation Modeling. The two hypotheses developed for this study were tested through regression analysis which indicated that both negatively affect good governance in the Nigerian public sector. The study revealed that the independence of SAIs in Nigeria was impaired in two critical areas; deliberate under-funding of SAIs and the quality of external auditor hired to perform the task. The study recommends that the constitutional provision that impairs the independence of SAIs should be repealed to ensure their financial autonomy. Finally, the study suggested that the Nigerian government should allow the SAI to independently determine the appointment of experienced external auditors and their fees.

N2  - Membership in the American Medical Association (AMA) has suffered a precipitous decline since the 1970s and, with it, a loss in revenue. The expansion of subsidized student memberships has bolstered its official membership number; only 12.6% of physicians who have completed their training now belong. The AMA strengthened its alliances with specialty societies and even tried to restructure the organization around organizational (rather than individual) membership: two hundred specialty societies are incentivized to encourage their members to join theAMA. Earlier federal policies supported by the AMA that gave it a central role in recommending Medicare reimbursement policies have established a membership pipeline for the AMA partly because specialty societies need to influence reimbursement policies. Commercial products have also helped subsidize AMA lobbying efforts that reinforce its historical position, despite a loss of members.

programme to explore the link between audits and government hiring
practices. We find that audited municipalities employ less labour to
provide a given level of public services, and change the way in which
they screen their employees-relying less on discretion and more on

N2  - Police and prosecutorial activities that take place long before a criminal trial are frequently critical to, even dispositive of, the accuracy and reliability of case disposition. At the same time, the regulatory touch of constitutional criminal procedure in the pretrial realm is insistently light. Proposals to address actual or risked deficiencies in this arena have proliferated in recent years, exemplified by pushes for social-science-rooted investigative best practices, for broader defense access to evidence prior to trial, for more oversight in plea bargaining, and so on. But in the face of these critiques, broad pretrial discretion largely reigns. A prevailing explanation for this state of affairs is rooted in our putative preference for an accusatory rather than inquisitorial system of criminal justice. And the leading solutions on offer frequently urge at least a partial turn away from adversarial obsession to embrace more inquisitorial traditions. The central argument of this Article is that this prevailing account is incomplete, and that the gaps have real world consequences for criminal justice reform. The Article uncovers an additional and consequential strain in the doctrinal narrative, one that depicts the pretrial world as the very inquisitorial, Continental mode that is so roundly rejected in the context of adjudication. This "quasi-inquisitorialism" in turn enables the Court to construct a separate realm of prosecutorial and police bureaucracy, professionalism, and expertise that purportedly fills the gap in judicial oversight. In addition to offering a fuller explanation of the structure of the Court's constitutional criminal procedure doctrine, this account aims for greater leverage for reform. The Article concludes by suggesting that exploiting this quasi-inquisitorial narrative might offer promising inroads-doctrinally, politically, or both-for reformed approaches to investigative oversight, pretrial discovery, and plea bargaining.

N2  - With Universal Health Coverage (UHC) now entrenched among the top global development priorities, questions arise as to the conditions under which politicians commit to UHC and why certain strategies for health financing and access are favoured over others. The Ethiopian government has been piloting and scaling-up Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI) for the informal sector since 2010 and is establishing Social Health Insurance for formal sector workers as a means of achieving UHC. CBHI covers 11 million people making it one of the largest health insurance schemes in Africa. This paper employs a process tracing methodology to examine the political drivers of the adoption and evolution of state health insurance based on 28 key informant interviews conducted between 2015 and 2018 with politicians, policymakers and donor officials. The paper highlights the inadequacy of existing theories focusing on interest group mobilisation, electoral competition and bureaucratic actors for explaining the Ethiopian case. Instead the paper proposes an `Adapted Political Settlements' framework that explains the state's push to expand CBHI and stalled progress on SHI. This framework highlights the interests and ideas of the ruling coalition as important drivers of reform. In a context of ruling party dominance and minimal threat from electoral competition, the ruling coalition has sought to build political legitimacy through the delivery of socioeconomic progress, including health services. The policy idea of health insurance, meanwhile, has secured elite commitment due to its fit with deeply held ideas within the ruling coalition concerning the importance of self-reliance and resource mobilisation for development. Finally, the centralisation of power within the ruling coalition prior to 2012 enabled the emergence of a long-term developmental vision and the marginalisation of opposition to health insurance, while fragmentation of the ruling coalition since 2012 has led SHI to stall.

N2  - Once the poster child for government-sponsored overfishing, New England by 2005 had become a fishery conservation success story. This article develops and deploys a problem-definition framework to explain the dramatic shift from a permissive to a protective fishery management regime in New England. I argue that neither new and improved scientific information nor pressure from powerful commercial interests caused government officials to modify their approach to fishery management. Instead, environmentalists used lawsuits to threaten fishery managers' autonomy and thereby forced them to replace fishers' risk-tolerant definition of the problem with environmentalists' more precautionary one as the basis for management. Environmentalists had legal leverage because they were able to demonstrate convincingly a substantial discrepancy between what the agency's governing statute required and what managers actually did. Two factors were critical to environmentalists' success: a compelling and credible scientific story about the relationship between fishing and the health of fish stocks, and an explicit conservation requirement in the language governing fishery management.

N2  - An essential issue in the political life of northern Italy and Tuscany during the 14th and 15th centuries, the procedures for appointing the magistrates have long attracted scholarly interest. Yet, confronted with a great and sometimes excessive quantity of sources, historians are not sufficiently aware that the records themselves are an extraordinary manifestation of the developing notion of office and of the practical aspects of appointment. In princely states such as Milan, Ferrara and Mantua, the breaking with communal procedures caused a late but radical change in the records, directly reflecting the construction of the state. In republics such as Florence and Venice, the documents are more massive and diverse; they are products of long tradition, and tend to be adapted from the inside, much as electoral procedures themselves were changed while retaining the same formal appearance. Another difference occurs between Florence, where the artful manipulation of votes gave rise to a growing variety of registers, and other states, where the rule of a prince or of an oligarchy made forms simpler or preservation of documents more uncertain.

N2  - This paper develops a model in which a desire to avoid criticism prompts otherwise public-spirited bureaucrats to behave inefficiently. Decisions are taken to keep interest groups quiet and to keep mistakes out of the public eye. The policy implications of this "minimal squawk" behavior are at odds with the view that agencies should be structured to minimize the threat of "capture." An empirical test using data from US State Public Utility Commissions rejects the capture hypothesis and is consistent with the squawk hypothesis: longer PUC terms of office are associated with a higher incidence of rate reviews and lower household electricity bills.

N2  - This chapter explains the theory behind an information communication technology (ICT) being developed to provide marginalised populations with a tool for uniting the voices of progressive-minded activists. The theory suggests that with this technology, seemingly incompatible progressive groups might enlarge their campaigns for social equity, creating a global, heterogeneous network. The ICT allows for the capture of crowd-sourced artistic creativity, and through algorithms that have been shaped by academics in public administration, makes content retrievable as pluralistic, policy-supporting narrative threads. The new narratives should also work to alter the discourse within communities by diminishing the worldview threats associated with zero-sum ideology. This ICT is seen as vital because of how powerful lobbyists (funded by global elites) have consistently been successful in skewing the outcomes of policymaking decisions and elections. The system is firmly rooted in the small-group, consensus-building organisational theories of respected authors dating back to the 1970s. © 2016 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

N2  - The article examines the political sympathies of the army command staff of the Ukrainian People's Republic under the Central Rada on the eve of the Hetman's coup and shows the connection between the sentiments among the senior officers and the inter-party struggle of the Ukrainian parties for the state leadership. As a result there began a new stage in the intense inter-party struggle after the liberation of Kyiv from the Bolshevik troops and the return to the capital, where the leading parties that had initiated the establishment of the Central Rada and subsequent state-building processes were involved. In the March of 1918, the UPSR, USDRP and UPSF negotiated the idea of formation of a governing coalition. It should be noted that the discussion had gone far beyond the dispute over the distribution of ministerial portfolios. The UPSF demanded the abandoning of the principle of the partisanship priority while the appointment to a senior positions, and the USDRP began an internal discussion on establishing the existing coalition. The new committee of the Council of People's Ministers lasted only for a month, when the ministers, members of the UPSF party, announced their withdrawal from the governing coalition, and therefore the government experienced a new crisis. The intransigence of the parties, the unwillingness to compromise, and the attempt to insist on one's opinion at any cost affected all the aspects of state-building, including the process of creating the UPR army. Ukrainian parties vied for the support of the senior officers, fought with the political opponents. The article concludes that excessive politicization was one of the factors that hindered the creation of a combat-ready army of the Ukrainian People's Republic. The crisis in the OUN is the logical consequence of the politization of law enforcement structures. The authors claim that the perils of such process must be taken into consideration while establishing the modern approaches to nation and state building. A well-organized administration, an independent judiciary system, effective law enforcement, and a reliable army are the keys to state stability.

N2  - Several global narratives around resource insecurities have reached the Mekong Region. In the latest re-incarnation, experts, bureaucrats and businesses have called for greater attention to a water-energy-food nexus. It is not clear however, if they are talking about the same thing, with the same purpose or that decision-makers are listening. The purpose of this study was to identify the key features of nexus narratives globally, and then analyze how they are being used in the Mekong Region. We used the Narrative Policy Framework to explore narrative content and strategies, and Cultural Theory to help identify policy beliefs of competing coalitions in a mixed-methods analysis. Increasing resource scarcity, which undermines security, was a shared setting in all nexus narratives. Individualist and Hierarchist narratives tend to de-politicize the nexus by promising solutions from innovative businesses and free markets, or through technocratic and managerial control of resources and the environment by bureaucrats. Egalitarian narratives identify victims and villains to re-politicize the nexus around themes of justice and human security. Nexus narratives were used to support and oppose hydropower, irrigation and biofuel development, with Individualist narratives consistently being the most pro-development. Nexus narratives have been widely adopted by international organizations and foreign experts working in the Mekong Region; however, with a few exceptions, they have as of yet had little direct influence on national policy or plans. Several possible reasons are discussed, including limitations of the concept itself.

N2  - This chapter presents a valuable framework for analysing green transformations in developing economies using two case studies from the so-called Global South: Costa Rica and Vietnam. Central lessons for other countries are that Costa Rica reversed its pathway of deforestation by reforesting the land and then addressing criticisms of its development by generating more genuinely green growth. Vietnam has previously focused on post-conflict restoration and economic development and has now turned towards green transformations, announcing an ambitious green growth strategy. The chapter shows that these countries – rather than having chosen easy pathways – made difficult choices that went against powerful vested interest groups within the country. This makes the decisions (and possibly the experiences) particularly relevant to other (smaller) countries considering taking a pathway involving green transformation.

N2  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the politicization of senior civil service (SCS) in Korea from a human resource perspective. To be specific, it is to explore how much the SCS has been politicized after its inception in 2006 and to discover what has strengthened it. Design/methodology/approach This paper employs the human resource management perspective with five stages, selection, rotation, education, promotion and compensation, which are related with different weights to four causes of politicization: political desire to control, leadership change, public demands and political interest. Findings This paper argues that politicization of SCS in Korea has gradually increased during the last 10 years. It also found that, while selection and promotion is strongly politicized, education and compensation is weakly politicized. Originality/value This paper mainly draws increasing politicization after it was introduced. Little prior literature has explored the politicization of SCS in human resource management processes and its causes for Korea.

N2  - This study considers how, in the absence of elections for national office, authoritarian ruling parties create organizational channels for selecting officials. Through a case study of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), I examine the selection problem facing the ruling party. Within the CCP, special training academies, also known as party schools, serve as a pipeline to higher party and government posts. An examination of selection patterns for these schools reveals that there exists a mix of political and professional factors which determine invitation to a party school training program, suggesting the coexistence of patronage and meritocratic processes in promotion for higher office. Empirical analysis of these selection processes takes three parts. Individual-level characteristics, such as party membership, frequency of interaction with superiors, and educational background, are significant predictors of selection for a party school program. Second, to control for selection bias, I employ a matching procedure and find that the "treatment" of enrollment in a party school training program significantly increases the likelihood that an individual will be promoted to a higher rank in comparison to those without party school training experience. Third, additional tests indicate that these schools serve a screening function for the party, thus providing an organizational means for CCP leaders to manage who enters the highest ranks of political leadership. In this sense, the training process itself serves an informational function for party authorities, beyond the ritual these organizations are long thought to embody.

N2  - This article examines the role of cabinet appointments in controlling the bureaucracy in presidential democracies. I demonstrate how administrative challenges stemming from the structure of the bureaucracy shape presidential choice of ministers. Analyzing a sample of four East Asian cases from 1986 through 2013, I find that presidents are more likely to select ministers from the civil service as bureaucracies are more professionalized, controlling for several political factors. Further evidence from qualitative interviews and case studies suggests that, in professionalized systems equipped with a sizable pool of talent but lacking responsiveness, presidents tend to promote ideologically aligned senior civil servants. However, in politicized systems, where presidents easily obtain responsiveness but face a low level of competence, policy experts tend to be selected from outside the bureaucracy. My findings have important implications for the regulatory governance and state capacity of East Asia, demonstrating the value of balancing between responsiveness and competence.

N2  - The following assessment of the standing of the judiciary in Australia would be regarded as generally accurate: ‘Measured in historical and international terms the Australian judiciary is acknowledged to be of outstanding quality and has enjoyed the public’s confidence.’ Nevertheless, there have been particular judicial appointments which were claimed to be motivated by political considerations or which were based on cronyism. Simon Evans and John Williams wrote: It is a notorious fact that judicial officers have been appointed whose character and intellectual and legal capacities have been doubted and whose appointments have been identified as instances of political patronage. Such claims exist due to the fact that the process of judicial appointment lacks transparency. In noting calls for greater transparency in judicial appointments processes, the current federal Attorney-General (Robert McClelland) acknowledged that the mystery surrounding the current processes and the controversy over past appointments would give rise to two negative consequences: ‘First, it can tarnish or detract from the honour of being appointed to judicial office. Second, at a broader level it can diminish public confidence in the courts and the justice system.’ The federal Attorney-General’s response to the issue was that improvements could be made through the ‘touchstones of increased transparency and greater consultation’. Apart from the growing calls for reforms to the appointments process, increasing interest at the federal level and in a number of the states is also focused on the absence of appropriate mechanisms for handling complaints against judicial officers for misconduct which is not of sufficient seriousness to warrant the extreme measure of removal from office. In Australia, most judicial appointments are effected without much publicity. Senior judicial appointments do attract a degree of media interest, especially appointments to the High Court of Australia. When a vacancy arises in the High Court there is the usual speculation about the identity of the person likely to be appointed to fill the vacancy. At both federal and state levels, judicial appointments are in reality made by the government of the day. In formal constitutional terms, the appointment of federal judges is made by the Governor-General in Council, while the appointment of state judges is made by the Governor in Council. A discussion paper issued by the federal Attorney-General’s Department in 1993 succinctly describes the appointment process as varying according to the ‘personal preferences of individual Attorneys-General’.

N2  - The authors examined the impact of municipal government structures on the bond ratings of municipalities in the USA. While their initial analysis suggested that the mayor-council system has a negative impact on municipal bond ratings, the application of Nelson and Svara's (2010) government typology demonstrated that the political influence of a mayor on the appointment of the chief administrative officer is a driving factor that negatively affects bond ratings, regardless of the government being a mayor-council or a council-manager form.

N2  - One underexplored question in the representative bureaucracy literature is whether public employees advocate for their demographic groups at the expense of other groups or their organizational roles. Many studies have focused on the link between passive representation, or the extent to which the public workforce reflects the demographic characteristics of its clients, and active representation, or the extent to which policies advance the interests of those people. However, little research has been done on whether and when increased representation by a certain group enhances overall organizational performance. This study examines the relationship between racial minority representation in U.S. federal agencies and the agencies' goal achievement while considering the moderating role of organizational mission and diversity climate. The panel data analysis shows that increased minority representation lowers agencies' goal achievement. However, a positive relationship exists between the two in agencies that mainly work to promote social equity for disadvantaged populations and foster a positive diversity climate in the workplace. These findings suggest that racial minority employees can better contribute to organizational success in agencies where they balance advocacy and organizational roles well and they are treated fairly and respectfully.

N2  - It is widely believed that “fire alarm” oversight (i.e., reactive oversight that responds to the complaints of interest groups) rather than “police patrol” oversight (i.e., precautionary congressional surveillance), better promotes the performance of government agencies by efficiently reducing bureaucratic moral hazard. However, fire alarm oversight can lead to bureaucrats being falsely accused by interest groups who provide biased information to members of Congress of failure to properly implement a policy, thereby causing an unnecessary administrative delay in public management. This article suggests a formal model that compares fire alarm and police patrol oversight and examines the development of congressional oversight mechanisms in the United States.

N2  - The Watergate scandal of 1973 claimed many casualties, political and otherwise. Along with many personal reputations and careers, President Richard Nixon's bold attempt to achieve a sweeping reorganization of the domestic portion of the executive branch was also pulled into the vortex. Now, Mordecai Lee examines Nixon's reorganization, finding it notable for two reasons. First, it was sweeping in intent and scope, representing a complete overhaul in the way the president would oversee and implement his domestic agenda. Second, the president instituted the reorganization administratively by appointment of three super-secretaries without congressional approval. The latter aspect generated ire among some members of Congress, notably Sam Ervin, a previously little-known senator from North Carolina who chaired the Government Operations Committee and, soon after, the Senate's Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities known to the public as the Watergate Committee. Asserting that Nixon's reorganization effort represents a significant event in the evolution of the managerial presidency and public administration, Nixon's Super-Secretaries presents the most comprehensive historical narrative to date concerning this reorganization attempt. The author has utilized previously untapped original and primary sources to provide unprecedented detail on the inner workings, intentions, and ultimate demise of Nixon's ambitious plan to reorganize the sprawling federal bureaucracy.

N2  - The aims of this study are to identify what hinders implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Article 5.3 in Korea, and to provide suggestions for the implementation of Article 5.3. Official governmental documents on tobacco control were reviewed. We also searched news articles for data triangulation. There were three factors that hindered the implementation of Article 5.3 in Korea. Firstly, there has been legal conflict between two tobacco-related laws, one of which is designed to promote the tobacco industry. The other is designed to promote public health. Secondly, the government has had economic interests in the tobacco industry, and its lack of action to effectively regulate the tobacco industry's corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices has hindered the implementation of Article 5.3. Thirdly, the tobacco industry's lobby and active interference in the policy-making process has been a barrier. To fully implement Article 5.3, this study suggests: defusing legal conflict between tobacco-related laws; not considering tobacco industry as a stakeholder; regulating tobacco industry's CSR activities; raising awareness of tobacco industry interference; securing transparency between the government and tobacco industry; and establishing a core group or a committee under the government to implement Article 5.3.

N2  - "Lobbyists at Work is a must-read for anyone interested in the serious business of government. Leech''s probing questions reflect her years of research tracking the real impact of money and influence on policy." -Thomas Hale Boggs, Jr. (Chairman, Patton Boggs LLP) Received wisdom has it that lobbyists run the American government on behalf of moneyed interests. But what makes lobbyists run, and how do they induce legislators and bureaucrats to do their bidding? These are questions for which even the harshest critics lack satisfying answers. Lobbyists at Work explores what lobbyists really do and why. It goes behind the scenes and brings back in-depth interviews with fifteen political advocates chosen to represent the breadth and diversity of the lobbying profession. The interviewees profiled in this book range from the top lobbyists-for-hire at the most powerful K Street firms to pro bono lobbyists for the disenfranchised and powerless. The roster spans all types of lobbyists working for all types of clients and seeking to influence all levels and branches of government. The permutations include business-lobbying-government, government-lobbying-government, government-to-business revolving door, regulatory lobbying, state and local lobbying, citizen-advocacy lobbying,single-issue lobbying, and multiple-issue lobbying. In colorful and sometimes hilarious detail, the interviewees take the reader through their arsenals of traditional and next-generation lobbying techniques, including face-to-face persuasion of elected officials and their staffs, educational campaigns and coalition-building, ghost-drafting complex legislation and regulation for government committees and agencies, contributions, and social media campaigns. In Lobbyists at Work, the normally self-effacing subjects open up about themselves and their profession: why they chose to become lobbyists, what motivates them to keep lobbying, how they cultivate their lobbying influence, how they adjust to changes in the rules affecting their lobbying methods, and what they actually do at work each day (and night). As an authority on lobbying respected in Washington for her impartiality, Professor Beth Leech elicits frank disclosures, career tips, and riveting stories about the good, the bad, and the ambivalent on both sides of the symbiotic relationship between government officials and lobbyists. What you''ll learn As a result of reading Lobbyists at Work, you will learn: what lobbyists really do and to what extent the stereotypes about lobbyists are warranted (if you are a general reader) expert tips on how to multiply your political influence (if you are a citizen activist) what types of lobbying jobs are available and how different types of lobbyists spend their workdays (if you aspire to be a lobbyist) how to manage and build your lobbying career (if you are already a lobbyist) Howard Marlowe, The Lobbyists'' Lobbyist Robert Walker, Former Congressman Lobbyist Nick Allard, Patton Boggs Lobbyist Julie Stewart, Single-Issue Citizen Advocate Laura Murphy, ACLU Rights Lobbyist Lyle Dennis, Specialty Lobbyist Dale Florio, State House Lobbyist Christina Mulvihill, Corporate Lobbyist Leslie Harris, Internet Freedom Lobbyist Mark Burnham, State University Lobbyist Danielle Her Many Horses, Native American Gaming Lobbyist Timothy Richardson, Police Officers'' Lobbyist Jonathan Schleifer, Educational Change Lobbyist Faith Shapiro, ACLU Intern; Angela Guo, CAP Action Intern Craig Holman, Public Citizen Lobbyist Who this book is for Lobbyists at Work appeals to a broad readership, including all American citizens who are alarmed by news coverage of the outsized role of influence-mongering on our system of government and want to dig deeper; students of politics, especially in courses focusing on interest groups; prospective lobbyists finishing their degrees or already working in politics; and the 200,000 lobbyists operating today in the United States.

N2  - A substantial literature has been devoted to analyzing how legislators delegate regulatory power to a more knowledgeable agency. Yet, much less attention has been paid to understand how this delegation process is shaped by the environment in which this agency operates, and more specifically by the actions of interest groups. We propose a model of regulatory capture to assess how the distribution of information across interest groups and agencies impacts optimal delegation. Whether an interest group and his agency share information or not determines the scope for capture and how much discretion should be left to this agency in response. Whether asymmetric information reduces or increases discretion depends on the biases of the group and the agency vis-a-vis Congress. Groups that are more aligned with Congress collect politically relevant information, while more extreme groups remain poorly informed. The information structure that endogenously emerges increases discretion under broad circumstances.

N2  - The article discusses how European churches are participating in what is a significant political decision for the identity and integration of Europe: the potential EU membership of Turkey. The discussion is based on a document and statement issued by the Conference of European Churches, and official and unofficial statements by various individual churches. Interviews augment the research material.The background material includes debates in the European Parliament between 1999 and 2003, and reports issued by the European Commission. The material was analysed using qualitative content analysis. Although Turkey's proposed EU membership has been both supported and opposed on religious grounds in the European Parliament, the EU has not requested statements from churches on the matter. The Conference of European Churches has nevertheless issued a public statement. The research shows that there are differences in approach between churches. The Catholic Church takes a passive positive position to the accession of Turkey into the EU, while the opinions of Protestant churches echo the positions of their respective home countries, pursuant to the Doctrine of the Two Kingdoms. The Orthodox Church is in favour of Turkey's EU membership. There are also differences between churches in the political lobbying they pursue. The Catholic Church employs international diplomacy, while the Protestants issue public statements and the Orthodox Church lobbies key EU decision-makers directly.The findings show that all European churches seek to influence political decisions in one way or another. On the whole it is not European churches that see the Muslim-majority Turkey as a threat, but rather the secular political elite.

N2  - This paper analyzes possible contributing bureaucratic factors to China's spectacular 40-year economic growth. At the level of practical bureaucratic incentives for officials, some scholars point to political patronage as both an appropriate and effective contributor to economic growth. They argue that the patronage bureaucracy system is an optimal alternative political model to the impersonal and merit-based Weberian model for developing countries. In this paper, we test this theory by empirically analyzing the relationship of patronage to economic growth against the effects of both fiscal federalism and promotion tournament models. We find that political patronage in China appears to reduce economic growth, in another word, the patronage hinders economic growth.

N2  - Objectives More than 16 000 graduate degrees in public health are awarded annually. Yet only 14\% of the governmental public health workforce has formal public health training of any kind, and 8\% has a master of public health (MPH) degree. We characterized the differences among governmental staff members with master's degrees across US health departments. Methods We used data from the 2017 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey, a national survey of state and local public health departments (43 669 responses; response rate, 48\%). We examined the characteristics of the workforce by educational attainment and compared respondents who had obtained a ``terminal{''} (ie, highest degree obtained) MPH degree with respondents who had obtained a terminal non-public health (non-PH) master's degree. Results Respondents who had a non-PH master's degree were as likely as respondents who had an MPH degree to hold a supervisory role (43\% vs 41\%;P= .67). We found only 1 significant difference between the 2 groups: respondents aged <= 40 with a terminal MPH degree were significantly less likely than respondents aged <= 40 with a non-PH master's degree to earn more than the national average salary (adjusted odds ratio = 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.47-0.97;P= .03). Conclusions We found only marginal differences in career outcomes for people working in governmental public health who had a terminal MPH degree vs a terminal non-PH master's degree. This finding does not necessitate a full reconsideration of the MPH as it relates to governmental public health practice but a greater recognition that there are multiple paths into practice.

N2  - The field of disability studies has largely overlooked the role of trade unions in the promotion of the rights of workers with disabilities. To address this oversight, this article explores how union activists pursue disability rights and how this cause is situated in their struggle for workers' rights in Belgium, a country which both has a strong welfare system and gives a predominant role to social partners in industrial relations. It argues that there is a division of work inside unions between representatives at branch level who lobby to increase job opportunities in sheltered workshops and diversity officers at interbranch level who attempt to strengthen equality in the ordinary labour market. Although these two groups do not pursue disability rights in the same way, they share in common a reluctance to mobilise anti-discrimination law because the ideals of equality contradict the routinised practices of employers and of workers' organisations.

N2  - The article offers an easy-to-use indicator for scholars and practitioners to measure whether NGOs, international organizations, and government policies and projects meet the criteria for design and implementation of “capacity building” projects that have been established by various international organizations and that are recognized by experts in the field. The indicator can be used directly to address failures that are routinely reported in this key and growing development intervention. Use of this indicator on more than a dozen standard interventions funded today by international development banks, UN organizations, country donors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) reveals that while many smaller organizations are working to change institutions and society in ways that effectively build long-term capacity, most of the major actors in the field of development have failed to follow their own guidelines. Many appear to be using “capacity building” as a cover for lobbying foreign governments to promote international agendas (“purchasing foreign officials”) and/or to increase the power of particular officials at the expense of democracy, with the public lacking simple accountability tools. The indicator points to specific areas for holding development actors accountable in order to promote development goals of sustainability and good governance. The breadth of the field of “capacity building” also allows this indicator to be used, with some modifications, for a large variety of development interventions. This article also offers several examples of where current capacity building projects fail, along with a sample test of the indicator using UNCDF as a case study.

N2  - The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) is an exemplar result of global health diplomacy, based on its global reach (binding on all World Health Organization member nations) and its negotiation process. The FCTC negotiations are one of the first examples of various states and non-state entities coming together to create a legally binding tool to govern global health. They have demonstrated that diplomacy, once consigned to interactions among state officials, has witnessed the dilution of its state-centric origins with the inclusion of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the diplomacy process. To engage in the discourse of global health diplomacy, NGO diplomats are immediately presented with two challenges: to convey the interests of larger publics and to contribute to inter-state negotiations in a predominantly state-centric system of governance that are often diluted by pressures from private interests or mercantilist self-interest on the part of the state itself. How do NGOs manage these challenges within the process of global health diplomacy itself? What roles do, and can, they play in achieving new forms of global health diplomacy? This paper addresses these questions through presentation of findings from a study of the roles assumed by one group of non-governmental actors (the Canadian NGOs) in the FCTC negotiations. The findings presented are drawn from a larger grounded theory study. Qualitative data were collected from 34 public documents and 18 in-depth interviews with participants from the Canadian government and Canadian NGOs. This analysis yielded five key activities or roles of the Canadian NGOs during the negotiation of the FCTC: monitoring, lobbying, brokering knowledge, offering technical expertise and fostering inclusion. This discussion begins to address one of the key goals of global health diplomacy, namely 'the challenges facing health diplomacy and how they have been addressed by different groups and at different levels of governance' (Kickbusch et al. 2007a: 972).

N2  - Are evaluation targets negotiable in China's cadre evaluation system? If
so, which ones and how are they negotiated? Little empirical work
answers these questions, which reveals the reconciliation of political
control with local governance considerations in a centralized system.
This article bridges the literature on bureaucratic bargaining with that
on the target responsibility system by examining intra-governmental
bargaining in the performance target-setting process. In-depth
interviews reveal a ``tournament{''} logic of target-setting bargaining.
Drawing on interviews and an original dataset of personnel rules, we
conceptualize and classify performance targets based on their
negotiability. The findings bring to light the presence of bargaining,
albeit bounded, in the top-down rational-instrumental mechanism of the
target responsibility system, and the intricate relationship between
merit and personal connections in political selection.

N2  - This study explains the adoption of the National Childcare and Development Network in Costa Rica using John Kingdon's multiple streams approach. Traditionally, the literature on social policies argues that in the presence of socioeconomic transformations and pressures from women's movements and from left or center-left governments, the adoption of care policies is more likely to happen. Yet, Costa Rica adopted its care policy during a fiscal crisis, with a lack of demands for care policies from the women's movement, and with a right-wing party in government. Drawing data from documents and semistructured interviews, this article demonstrates the applicability of the multiple streams approach to understand care policy-making processes in developing countries. The study finds that the multiple streams approach effectively explains the adoption of the policy as the product of top-down decisions from the national women's agency that constructs the problem, a close-knit policy design led by technocrats and bureaucrats, and the politicization of care policies to gain electoral support. © 2022 Policy Studies Organization.

N2  - Imprisonment policy has become increasingly politicized since the mid-1960s, but we do not yet know the consequence of this shift for the professional orientations of prison workers. In this article, we use original surveys of prison officers in California and Minnesota to assess whether and how partisan identification and the politicization of crime policy predict officers' conceptualizations of the purpose and function of prisons. Results show that individual partisanship is associated with officers' attitudes, but this is conditional on state context. Along with deepening understandings about the determinants of street-level bureaucrats' perspectives, this article advances knowledge about how the broader political environment might shape the attitudes of front-line workers. This is important because prison officers' perspectives affect their workplace behaviour with consequences for staff-prisoner relationships, policy implementation and the routine operations of penal facilities.

N2  - In the present article, the problem of public authoruty's realization by means of bureaucracy was investigated. The task of searching for ways of debureaucratization of public authority (restrictions of negative manifestations, areas of work and functions of bureaucracy) might be accomplished with a historical and comparative methodology. The research helped to identify the presence of comparable elements of public authority and bureaucracy; to explain their comparable similarities and differences in a ``vertical plane'' - the phenomena of different time periods in indication the general tendencies of progress and causality were analyzed. The problem of public authority's realization by means of bureaucracy was specified according the materials of the researches of governance in ancient societies, early states, governmental machinery of bourgeois democracies. A special attention was given to an alternative Soviet power model that in practice had led to establishing a command and control system with a ruling ``class'' of nomenclature in our country. The general characteristics of public authority and bureaucracy in a post-Soviet society were identified. The research found that the transformation of public authority in the new phase of global social and economic development might mean its functional involvement in the international system of national resources' exhausting according to the interest of increasingly internationalizing elites. It was agreed that bureaucracy and institutes of direct and representative democracy, self-governance and control of civil society over the government are direct competitors. Nevertheless, post-industrial society provides new opportunities for debureaucratization. Therefore, the active and volitional actions of political groups as entire segments of society that are aimed at the struggle for the constitutional guarantees for rights to get information, a real access to education and a meaningful democracy, as a connected consequence represent a difficult, but necessary way to debureaucratization of public authority.

N2  - Federal Advisory Committees (FACs) offer opportunities for private citizens to gain access to the national security apparatus of the U.S. government. What explains the appointment of interest group affiliates to national security FACs? This article analyzes patterns of interest-group membership in FACs, using an original data set based on official General Services Administration data. Organizational affiliations are identified across thousands of appointments. The analysis shows that interest-group appointments to critical national security FACs increase with opposition-party power in Congress. This suggests that interest-group access improves when the administration needs help with a political strategy to overcome legislative opposition.

N2  - This article attempts to fill the void in research on the Justicialista Party (PI) organisation. Challenging accounts of the contemporary PJ as a weak, personalistic organisation, it argues that the party maintains a powerful base-level infrastructure with deep roots in working- and lower-class society. This organisation has been understated by scholars because, unlike prototypical working class party structures, it is informal and highly decentralised. The PJ organisation consists of a range of informal networks - based on unions, clubs, NGOs and activists' homes that are largely unconnected to the party bureaucracy. These organisations provided the government of Carlos Menem with a range of benefits in the 1990S, particularly in the realm of local problem-solving and patronage distribution. Yet they also constrained the Menem leadership, limiting its capacity to impose candidates and strategies on lower-level party branches.

N2  - This article seeks to explain the success or failure of Latin American labor-based parties in adapting to the contemporary challenges of economic liberalization and working class decline. It focuses on party organization, and specifically, on informal and under-institutionalized organizational forms. The article's central claim is that under-institutionalized organizational structures may facilitate party adaptation in a context of environmental crisis. Thus, mass populist parties, which lack the bureaucratic constraints that tend to inhibit change in better institutionalized labor-based parties, may possess a distinctive advantage in the neoliberal period. Although these parties' deep roots in society provide them with relative electoral stability, other populist legacies, such as fluid internal structures, non-bureaucratic hierarchies, and centralized leaderships, yield a high degree of strategic flexibility. The article applies this argument to the case of the Argentine Justicialista Party (PJ), a mass populist party that adapted with striking success in the 1980s and 1990s. In the coalitional realm, the poorly institutionalized nature of the PJ's party-union linkage allowed reformers to easily dismantle traditional mechanisms of labor participation, which contributed to the PJ's rapid transformation from a labor-dominated party into a patronage-based party. In the programmatic realm, the PJ's non-bureaucratic hierarchy and under-institutionalized leadership bodies provided President Carlos Menem with substantial room for maneuver in carrying out a neoliberal strategy that, while at odds with Peronism's traditional program, was critical to the party's survival as a major political force.

N2  - Prior to becoming president, Donald Trump was widely known as a successful business executive. As a candidate, Trump promised to run government like his business. His supporters and critics, however, disagree about how the president has performed as a manager. In this article, we review President Trump's performance as a manager during his first year in office. We examine three dimensions of his approach—transition preparation, staffing, and management style. Notably, we find that the president's halting transition limited his effectiveness in the first year. Unlike previous presidents, President Trump chose neither a politicizing nor a centralizing strategy to gain control over administrative policy making during his first year. We also note that President Trump prefers a competitive and freewheeling decision-making environment but is struggling with the consequences of such a structure. The article concludes with an assessment of the first year and prospects for the president moving forward.

N2  - This article reviews some recent advances in research on presidential appointments and personnel. I focus specifically on research analyzing changes in the institutional environment of presidential personnel, how presidents make decisions about whom to appoint, and the effects of presidential appointees on outputs. I explore what we know about how presidents have worked to change institutions surrounding presidential personnel by increasing the number of appointees and augmenting White House personnel operations. I examine how presidents decide what factors to value when choosing personnel. When do presidents value loyalty, competence, campaign support, or other characteristics of potential appointees? Finally, I examine the effects of appointees on outputs. What influence do appointees have over outputs and why do some have more influence than others? I describe the general trajectory of research in each area as well as some emerging issues confronting scholars in these areas. © Copyright 2011 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

N2  - In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, many questioned whether the large number of political appointees in the Federal Emergency Management Agency contributed to the agency's poor handling of the catastrophe, ultimately costing hundreds of lives and causing immeasurable pain and suffering. The Politics of Presidential Appointments examines in depth how and why presidents use political appointees and how their choices impact government performance--for better or worse. One way presidents can influence the permanent bureaucracy is by filling key posts with people who are sympathetic to their policy goals. But if the president's appointees lack competence and an agency fails in its mission--as with Katrina--the president is accused of employing his friends and allies to the detriment of the public. Through case studies and cutting-edge analysis, David Lewis takes a fascinating look at presidential appointments dating back to the 1960s to learn which jobs went to appointees, which agencies were more likely to have appointees, how the use of appointees varied by administration, and how it affected agency performance. He argues that presidents politicize even when it hurts performance--and often with support from Congress--because they need agencies to be responsive to presidential direction. He shows how agency missions and personnel--and whether they line up with the president's vision--determine which agencies presidents target with appointees, and he sheds new light on the important role patronage plays in appointment decisions. © 2008 by Princeton University Press.

N2  - The accumulation and use of power is crucial to the health policy process. This paper examines the power of the medical profession in the health policy arena, by analysing which actors are perceived as influential, and how influence is structured in health policy. It combines an analysis of policy networks and social networks, to examine positional and personal influence in health policy in the state of Victoria, Australia. In the sub-graph of the influence network examined here, those most widely regarded as influential are academics, medically qualified and male. Positional actors (the top politician, political advisor and bureaucrat in health and the top nursing official) form part of a core group within this network structure. A second central group consists of medical influentials working in academia, research institutes and health-related NGOs. In this network locale overall, medical academics appear to combine positional and personal influence, and play significant intermediary roles across the network. While many claim that the medical profession has lost power in health policy and politics, this analysis yields few signs that the power of medicine to shape the health policy process has been greatly diminished in Victoria. Medical expertise is a potent embedded resource connecting actors through ties of association, making it difficult for actors with other resources and different knowledge to be considered influential. The network concepts and analytical techniques used here provide a novel means for uncovering different types of influence in health policy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Government lawyers have been rather neglected by scholars interested in the workings of the legal profession and the role of professional groups in contemporary society. This is surprising given the potential for them to influence the internal workings of an increasingly legalistic and centralised state. This article aims to partly fill this gap by looking at the way that lawyers employed by the government and the administrators they work with talk about their jobs. It draws on the findings of a large-scale empirical study of government lawyers in seven departments, funded by the ESRC and undertaken by Philip Lewis between 2002-2003. By looking at lawyers in bureaucracies the interviews conducted revealed much about the work that government lawyers do, their relationship with other civil servants and the subtle influences on policy that they are able to exert.

N2  - Due to significant cost advantages, wind energy penetrated the energy mix of most large countries much faster than solar PV did until the recent decade. However, Japan has been almost one-sidedly leaning toward the more expensive solar PV. For using solar PV electricity, the Japanese consumers are also paying sizably higher tariffs than those in other countries, especially after the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 that led to the sudden suspension of all nuclear power plants. Japan's energy transition towards renewables is accordingly largely single legged, rather than more balanced to take advantage of both wind turbines and solar PV. This article explains the puzzle on why renewable energy development in Japan has created such a wide distance from more economically optimal situations. We focus on the initiation, formation and impacts of the solar lobby that comprises bureaucracies, politicians, solar PV manufacturers, and independent power producers. Policy implications are drawn for Japan and other countries on the importance of controlling political lobby to achieve less costly energy transition.

N2  - This study tries to determine to what extent the Chinese bureaucracy is merit-based. By triangulating quantitative and qualitative survey data from a sample of Chinese cadres (n=286), the authors aim to answer the research question: ‘What is the behavioral impact of the incentive structure the cadre management system helps to shape, and does the incentive matrix support a meritocratic work environment?'. The findings demonstrate that the promotion of local leading cadres is primarily based on their superiors’ recognition and appreciation. A principal-component analysis reveals that what impresses the superiors includes both patronage and merit factors, although patronage has a slight edge over merit. This study also suggests that good interpersonal skills are essential for both merit- and patronageoriented career advancement.

N2  - Since the existing regulation theory cannot give a persuasive explanation for regulatory capture causes, the root of capture and the hidden trade patterns in China were studied based on fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Examining in-depth interviews of executives of several enterprises, it was found that there were several trading models hidden in regulatory capture. The state-owned enterprises had an impact on the formation of the basic rules of the game without necessarily involving private payments to public officials; firms still wielded power over the politician. However, the methods by which private firms shaped the basic rules of the game were illicit and the private payments to public officials were not transparent. At the same time, the differences of such transactions were closely related to industry concentration and the degree of government intervention.

N2  - Turnover of police chiefs is brisk, with the average tenure of a chief of police ranging from 4 to 6 years, but few scholars have examined factors which may impact police chief turnover. This study contributes to the literature on police chief turnover via an examination of the impact that two forms of performance—leadership performance and departmental performance—may have on police chief turnover. Analyzed herein are peer-evaluation survey data and administrative data obtained from the Law Enforcement Management Institute of Texas and the Texas Commission of Law Enforcement. Regression analyses of the data suggest that leadership and departmental performance are associated with turnover, with leadership performance having the larger impact. Time in office, being an external appointment/hire, and having been hired by a city mayor also proved to significantly affect turnover. The policy and personal life-choice implications of the data for police officials and policy makers are discussed, as are the methodological implications.

N2  - Countries throughout Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe are moving from semi-closed to open economies and from authoritarian to democratic political systems. Despite important differences between the regions, these transitions involve similar tasks: the establishment of governmental institutions and electoral systems conducive to legitimation of the new and fragile democracies and expansion of the institutional infrastructure of a market economy.This volume looks at both regions, focusing on the relationship between the tasks of institutional design and the outcomes of the process of economic and political liberalization. In particular, the contributors emphasize the design of institutions to serve a market economy, the design of electoral laws, and the design of executive-legislative relations. Each chapter discusses the legacy of the pre-existing authoritarian regime; the range of preferences among various strategic actors (the government, state bureaucracies, opposition parties, and interest groups) with regard to the pace and mix of reforms; and the consequences of final choices for the institutionalization of effective economies and the process of democratization.

N2  - We study how two selection systems for public officials, appointment and election, affect policy outcomes, focusing on state court judges and their criminal sentencing decisions. First, under appointment, policy congruence with voter preferences is attained through selecting judges with homogeneous preferences. In contrast, under election, judges face strong reelection incentives, while selection on preferences is weak. Second, the effectiveness of election in attaining policy congruence critically depends on payoffs from the job, which implies that the effectiveness of election may vary substantially across public offices. Third, reelection incentives may discourage judges with significant human capital from holding office.

N2  - In representative democracies, a variety of rules are employed to select and retain public officials to reflect public preferences over policies. We discuss the literature on selection and retention rules for government officials, focusing on low-information offices. First, we overview the historical origins and the scope of the variation in selection and retention rules. Second, we provide conceptual frameworks for assessing the advantages and disadvantages of direct elections and discuss various factors that influence the functioning of elections. Third, we present empirical regularities. We summarize the baseline effects of the institutional variation and their interaction with factors such as media and compensation. Finally, we discuss outstanding questions on theoretical and empirical fronts, and how the digitization of government information and advances in machine learning can open up new avenues for research.

N2  - The concept of sustainable development has been criticized for its broadness and ambiguity that permits different interpretations in separate views. However, the prior studies on sustainable development generally relied on survey data, so they have some limitations that preclude congruent conclusions. In contrast to prior studies, we used Q methodology, which is designed to investigate subjective perceptions as it is. This study aims to explore the South Koreans' perceptions of sustainable development among various stakeholders such as experts, bureaucrats, legislatures, civic groupmembers, company employees, and journalists. Based on the hierarchical belief system of the advocacy coalition framework, we classified all statements into three categories: core value, policy core, and secondary aspects. Using Q methodology, we extracted five types: (1) democrat; (2) idealist; (3) green growth advocate; (4) skeptics; and (5) elitist. We examined the distribution of the five types according to a hierarchical belief system, and discussed implications of the findings. © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - This study explores the impact of democratization on financial reform in Korea and Taiwan. In Korea, democratization decreased the autonomy and efficiency of bureaucrats and increased the power of business groups, which led to unregulated financial liberalization. Crisis contributed to the urgency of reform, coalitional support, and burden sharing among people. After the crisis, the re-strengthened bureaucracy and weakened veto power of business and labor sectors resulted in "path-breaking" reform in Korea. In Taiwan, the historically conservative financial system remained stable, allowing Taiwan to escape the Asian crisis but later becoming obstacles to reform. Democratization decreased the autonomy of bureaucrats and increased money politics: Lack of consensus among parties, divided government, and opposition within vested interest groups led to "lagged and stalemated" financial reform in Taiwan.

N2  - This paper analyses the political economy of economic reform and the ways in which the characteristics of developmental states have been changed in this reform process. It does this with attention to the experience of structural transformation in the manufacturing, information technology and financial sectors in Korea. Using the coalition theory of policy reform, the main finding from these cases is that the relationships among politicians, bureaucrats and interest groups have been altered so that interest groups' power has been strengthened compared to politicians and bureaucrats. Although a crisis is important in promoting economic reform, broader-ranging trends, such as democratisation, globalisation and technological progress, have also been important fundamental forces. Even with change, the reform process in Korea continues to reflect the legacies of the developmental state, with the state still playing an important role in planning, implementing and sustaining economic reform.

N2  - Despite past reforms, the Malaysian bureaucracy has lagged behind rising expectations. This paper reviews past reforms and suggests changes in reform strategy and measures for improving both the capacity and the will of public officials needed to raise administrative performance to meet domestic and global pressures. Combining technological and political perspectives, it argues that improving the will of public officials is both more important and more difficult than improving their capacity. Improving the will to perform promises significant gains in performance, but it requires reforms, mainly strengthening public control and making the bureaucracy more representative, that entail significant sacrifice of the interests of entrenched elites and groups. Malaysia has reached a juncture where she has to confront politically more difficult choices in administrative reform than in the past.

N2  - The modern presidency is heavily politicized. The president is expected to be the chief legislator, chief economist, chief psychiatrist, and chief diplomat for the nation and is the cog around which national affairs revolve. However, a politicized presidency signals the downfall of the managerial presidency that was buttressed by agencies with neutral competence. This article traces the evolution of an American budgetary agency, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from its inception to the present, documenting the baleful impact of the politicized presidency on the OMB. Amid politicization, the OMB lost its professional reputation for neutral competence and was replaced by the Congressional Budget Office as the foremost authority on national budgetary matters. This article, in essence, presents a cautionary tale of agency politicization in modern bureaucracy.

N2  - This paper presents an endogenous growth model with heterogeneous labour, endogenous unemployment, and public sector corruption. Unlike most previous studies, the model does not separate public officials and private individuals into two distinct groups. Instead, taking up bureaucratic appointment as a public servant is modelled as an occupational choice, which then allows for the endogenous determination of the proportion of public officials, the share of corrupt officials among them, and the public investment efficiency of the economy. The dynamics of endogenous corruption and unemployment are studied using numerical policy experiments based on a stylized representation of a middle-income African economy with high corruption and unemployment. The main finding is that, large-scale public infrastructure push has no effect on raising growth in an economy with high corruption. However, if preceded by social and anti-corruption policies that successfully induce a structural change, it will then be effective in raising growth.

N2  - The ``Risk Society'' as Ulrich Beck (Beck, Ulrich. 1992. Risk society: Towards a new modernity. London, UK: Sage, Beck, Ulrich. 1999. World risk society. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press) has called modern society, has changed the policy dynamics of many highrisk policies. Policy conflicts occur due to both physically objective risks and socially constructed risks. Risk politicization means that issue expansion and attention cycles are likely to be related to the social construction of policy images. An interesting case in point concerns the risk perception about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) among four groups of people in South Korea: bureaucrats, citizens, scientists, and interest groups. We develop expectations about how the four groups will frame the political issues based on their roles and concerns in the policy process. Downs' (Downs, Anthony. 1972. Up and down with ecology: The issueattention cycle. Public Interest 28: 3850) work on the issueattention cycle suggests how issues rise and fall on the public agenda, and our work also directly tests his theses. This study uses semantic network analysis based on content analysis of key words in 6 400 articles published in 2008 to construct semantic networks for the four stakeholder groups over four stages in the policy process. Through this unique data analysis, we can see the major issue concerns and intensity of each of the four groups in the four policy stages by assessing the key words each group uses in the media articles and the visualizations of their semantic associations. We do find distinct differences in what issues each of the four groups focus on and how the focus of substance changes in each of the four policy stages that clarify how these groups framed the BSE policy issues. Our results both confirm and raise doubts about some predictions from the issueattention cycle. Citizens' attention follows closely to Downs' predictions, whereas the other stakeholders' issueattention cycles do not follow Downs' predictions as well. Finally, our study explains and demonstrates the value of semantic network analysis as a powerful method for understanding issue framing in the policy process.

It was one of the most controversial issues in the Korean healthcare delivery system. Drawing on the conflict-cycle view and stakeholder analysis, which was used to examine how multiple stakeholders influenced this policymaking process, this study examines 1) the role of Korean civil society (i.e., civic and special interest groups) in SDP reform and 2) why SDP reform led to unintended consequences. We argue that bureaucrats in the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoHW) should have played a central role in accommodating the public interest. Because they failed to do so, civic groups assumed major mediating and moderating roles. Due to the civic groups' lack of technical knowledge and professional experience, however, they played a limited role. In finalizing the proposal, therefore, bureaucrats were captured by strong interest groups, leading to unintended consequences, such as the increased use of non-covered services and higher healthcare expenditures. To ensure that the government serves the authentic public interest rather than special interest groups, bureaucrats should be responsible to the public rather than these interest groups. Moreover, civic groups should be strengthened (in relation to strongly organized interest groups) and included systematically in creating health policy.

N2  - The command economic bureaucracies governing China's power sector have struggled to meet the power demands of a rapidly growing domestic economy in the reform era. Aiming to reduce the politicization and direct administration of electricity generation, transmission and distribution, the central planners launched three major episodes of institutional changes in the reform era which culminated in the creation of an independent ministry–level agency – SERC – to oversee an oligopoly of restructured power companies in 2002. However, a new regulator operating in face of powerful state–owned firms is bound to open a new chapter in contentious politics. Resistance to an arms-length regulatory relationship has come from the bureaucratic and market levels. We argue that the influential role of NDRC has undercut the institutional role and autonomy of SERC, while domestic players have been hampered in their growth strategies by lack of clarity in rules of competition. As a result, they have focused their efforts on crowding out the private sector and foreign investors, and lobbying around SERC for particularistic gains. We conclude by comparing the power sector to oil and petrochemicals, telecommunications, and transport sectors, deriving that even in a highly-authoritarian political environment, the domestic diffusion of regulatory institutions has manifestly produced different forms of governance with troubling implications for industry–specific regulatory bodies and peak associations.

N2  - This paper extends research on the corporate governance practices of transitional economies by examining whether the ability of the audit committee to constrain earnings management in Chinese firms is associated with the listing environment and the presence of government officials on the audit committee. Despite considerable regulatory reforms by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, there remain incentives for Chinese firms to manage earnings. However, government initiatives to encourage domestic firms to cross-list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange are accompanied by improved governance. We find that the expertise and independence of the audit committee for cross-listed (CL) Chinese firms are associated with lower abnormal accruals, our measure of earnings management. Both domestic only listed firms and CL Chinese firms appoint government officials as independent members on the audit committee. However, due to the political connection between government officials and the controlling shareholder (the State), these appointments can severely mitigate audit committee independence. Subsequently, we find a significant and positive association between audit committee independence and experience and earnings management when there are government officials on the audit committee.

N2  - I examine the process that led to major reforms in agriculture in
Sweden, culminating in 1990. Economists were largely responsible for
putting the issue on the agenda. Using a public choice perspective, they
reformulated the debate. Who benefited, who paid, and what were the true
costs? The reformulation illuminated an ``iron triangle{''}-farmers and
their
interest organizations, politicians, and the bureaucracy. When the new
policy coalition gained the initiative, connections and support from the
Ministry of Finance were critical, and led to a new will reaching the
Prime
Minister and finally into the bureaucracy itself, the Ministry of
Agriculture.
Economists and others overcame the iron triangle. Enlightened discourse
played no small role in overcoming resistance.

N2  - Public sector audit organizations are usually expected to fight corruption. Yet they may also end up being involved in, and contributing to, sustaining corruption. Relying on multiple interviews, this paper sheds new light on the concrete mechanisms through which corruption is sustained by Brazilian regional Courts of Accounts and their members. Our findings show how politico-economic elites’ private interests infiltrate the Courts via the appointment of high-ranked officials and how those officials may resort to a variety of actions to perpetrate forms of selective justice and to weaken the audit findings of these organizations – which ends up strengthening and supporting corruption. Additionally, we provide evidence of collective action emerging to challenge the current situation and reinforce the role Courts could play as watchdogs of the public interest. We contribute to the literature by highlighting the deleterious role of the interface between political and economic interests and the functioning of audit organizations. Moreover, relying on the literature of first- and second-order corruption, we discuss the specific conditions and mechanisms which enable corruption in public audit organizations. Finally, we present practical implications providing alternative views to the status quo.

N2  - Though there has been significant interest in the financialization of urban space, there has been little examination of the role of planning practitioners in these processes. Professional practices in publicly traded planning and engineering “megafirms”—global companies created through mergers and diversification—are marked by the influence of capital markets and shareholder value metrics, rather than traditional political and bureaucratic constraints. Drawing on analysis of corporate reports, political activity, and merger data, this research uses a financial lens through which to understand the changing nature of professional practices. The findings show that firms seek to influence funding decisions through activities such as lobbying and campaign finance, as well as more subtle strategies that draw on professional expertise. The imperative to increase shareholder value is driven down to the professional level, with tactics that integrate professional and entrepreneurial motives. With firms largely dependent on public-sector funding, this raises concerns about how tactics to increase shareholder value may conflict with both professional values and the public interest.

N2  - It is time for state servants to provide services to society in a professional, honest, fair and equitable manner in carrying out state, government and development tasks. This study aims to realize the attitude of state servants who must be neutral from the influence of all political groups and parties and not be discriminatory in providing services to the community. In the legal and governmental aspects, bureaucratic reform is a very strong issue to be realized. The methodology used in this research is descriptive qualitative with an effort to explain the phenomena in the field related to the Indonesian government bureaucracy which is suspected to have contributed greatly to the occurrence of various public service crisis management. The findings of this study indicate that there is a bureaucratic culture that is thick with bureaucratic politicization and the lack of transparency in public services. The mainactor public services has not prioritized fair service to the community. Therefore, bureaucratic reform is expected to be corrective measures against the Government’s political policies so that bureaucratic neutrality occurs.

N2  - While affirmative action in universities is the subject of extensive empirical scholarship, little research has been conducted on the role of university officials in crafting, defending, and transforming race-based affirmative admissions. Through forty-five in-depth interviews with thirty-nine admissions officials and top administrators at three selective public universities between 1999 and 2004, this study uncovers how a near-consensus in favor of race-based affirmative action has emerged among these players. Whereas scholars, citizens, and activists debate the morality and legality of race-based affirmative action as an equal opportunity policy, admissions decision makers have come to view race-based affirmative action in addition as a central, diversity management technique. This article claims that interest group capture theory and judicial implementation theory are insufficient to explain the diversity consensus. I suggest that neoinstitutional organizational theory has great potential to describe and situate the thought processes leading these key actors to forge this policy transformation.

This rhetorical strategy foregrounded the officials' participation in an ideally symbiotic relationship with the emperor they served. The author analyses instances in which leading bureaucrats recontextualized official occasions associated with the emperor to produce commemorations that clearly were not meant to be seen as positioned solely in the official sphere. They situated these works in their own personal spheres in terms of patronage, ownership and authorship of texts prominently featuring their own aims. This was done to enhance their own social status, reaffirm the prestige of office-holding, and solidify their close relationship with the reigning emperor. © Association of Art Historians 2002.

N2  - Manipulation of government finances for the benefit of narrowly defined groups is usually thought to be limited to the part of the budget over which politicians exercise discretion in the short run, such as earmarks. Analyzing a revenue-sharing program between the central and local governments in Brazil that uses an allocation formula based on local population estimates, I document two main results: first, that the population estimates entering the formula were manipulated and second, that this manipulation was political in nature. Consistent with swing-voter targeting by the right-wing central government, I find that municipalities with roughly equal right-wing and non-right-wing vote shares benefited relative to opposition or conservative core support municipalities. These findings suggest that the exclusive focus on discretionary transfers in the extant empirical literature on special-interest politics may understate the true scope of tactical redistribution that is going on under programmatic disguise.

N2  - This article asks how international secretariats can sometimes expand their authority in areas that relate neither to their mandate, nor to their sphere of expert authority. Existing explanations of mission creep assume that IOs act autonomously and expand in those areas that connect with their mandates, sense of organizational mission, and sphere of expert authority. The claim here is that entrepreneurial bureaucrats can succeed-in the absence of policy deadlock among states-in creating creep in unexpected issue domains through the mobilization of external expertise. The article examines this dynamic in the domain of bioethical standards. It shows that UNESCO acted as a first mover in the field, despite having no relevant expertise, and despite bioethics being more closely connected to the mandate of other organizations. Entrepreneurial bureaucrats within UNESCO were able to create creep in bioethics by mobilizing external experts in the field and capturing their skills. Working with external experts endowed their organization with the capacity to act, gave epistemic authority to their actions, and prevented the politicization of debates in a potentially controversial issue domain. In pointing to the strategic uses of expertise, the article challenges the commonly held view that expert knowledge acts as a means of solving problems and rationalizing global governance.

N2  - Between 1850 and 1903, the Oudh Bequest channelled over six million rupees from India, through British mediation, to the Shfï shrine cities of Najaf and Karbalä in Iraq. It has intrigued historians the way that this sophisticated British tool has exercised influence and control over the Shfï ̈ulamä in Iran and Iraq. However, the British became directly involved in the distribution of the Bequest in 1903, on the eve of the Constitutional Revolution. In view of the ̈ulamäs growing involvement in Iranian politics, and gross corruption among the distributors, the British saw the Bequest as a means to enhance their influence over the ̈ulamä in Iran. The political usage of the Bequest was a subject of a prolonged debate within Bequest bureaucracy. Disagreements often stemmed from different priorities, determined by local considerations, of British authorities in Iraq, Iran and India. In 1912 the British took over the direct distribution of the Bequest, abandoning their expectations to use the Bequest as a 'powerful lever' in Iran, and shifting their focus to enhancing their prestige in Iraq itself and acquiring the goodwill of Shfïis in India. These policies were renewed with greater vigour after the British occupation of Najaf and Karbalä in 1917. Overall, these British attempts ended in dismal failure, showing that charity, however generous, cannot compensate for the need of religious leaders to maintain popular support by distancing themselves from foreign patronage and tutelage. Moreover, manipulation proved less powerful than broader historical processes such as the rising national and religious awakening against foreign powers. © 2000 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.

N2  - Elites within a particular minority out-group in autocracies typically
exhibit fairly heterogeneous reactions to the ethnic group in power. The
usual result is intra-group variations in the propensity to participate
in ethnic conflict. To explain these within-group differences, I
highlight the importance of cross-ethnic patronage, which refers to
patronage allocated by the ethnic group in power to minority out-group
elites. The state can use cross-ethnic patronage to mitigate the risk of
ethnic conflicts through two mechanisms. First, the sharing of
government spoils at stakes gives minority elites disincentives to
initiate antiregime mobilizations, and second, this co-optation approach
effectively enlists cooperative minority elites to strengthen social
control. I examine my theory using original county-level fiscal and
personnel data of China's Xinjiang region, including annual payrolls and
the ethnic composition of over 220,000 local bureaucrats. Findings based
on a dataset of ethnic conflicts in Xinjiang from 1980 to 1995 support
my theoretical arguments.

The former were sponsored by an international bureaucracy whereas the latter was started by women activists. Clarifying the difference helps to recognize the unique challenges posed by the world conferences for activists of the international/global women's movement in the following aspects: dealing with logistical challenges, setting global priorities, coordinating international lobbying, and pushing for national implementation. Drawing on personal accounts, organizational records and United Nations documents, the paper explores how women activists adapted to the challenges and what lessons they offered for transnational activism in general.

N2  - Do lobbyists contribute money to legislators to build relationships in government? I show that lobbyists deploy resources strategically to get access to officials by analyzing newly available data on foreign lobbying in the U.S. government from 1998 to 2019, which contain information on lobbyists’ campaign contributions and contact with officials. Using supervised machine learning models, I identify lobbyist requests for access to members of Congress and classify them as either successful or unsuccessful. The data show that lobbyists request access almost exclusively to legislators to whom they made campaign contributions. Furthermore, lobbyists who contributed money to legislators are more likely to gain access to them than lobbyists who did not, but only if the legislators are ideologically similar and in the same party. While the data and research design I employ do not allow me to infer causal influence of contributions on access, these results suggest that lobbyists make contributions to foster an environment conducive to contact with like-minded officials.

Through analyzing the participator's utility maximization behavior, we prove the price of imported products and the importance the government attaches to the national welfare is inversely proportional with tariff, while the marginal revenue of domestic enterprise from protection is in proportion with tariff. The final tariff will go down with the number of foreign enterprise lobbying for preferred trade policy, and will go up with the volume of domestic market. After analyzing the affection of the information searching and free riding behavior, we find domestic enterprise would rather directly contribute government officer than collect information, while free riding damage to the enterprise cooperative enthusiasm.

N2  - Corruption is a great challenge for China. The supreme leaders of the Chinese Communist Party face a trade-off between cracking down on corruption and maintaining the stability and loyalty of the party-state apparatus. This article argues that this dilemma is partially resolved via personal connections between supreme leaders and provincial cadres, which may selectively decrease the intensity of anti-corruption campaigns and stabilize local bureaucracies. Using a combination of province-year data and individual-year, city-level data, this study shows that provincial leaders who were part of supreme leaders' informal political networks were able to significantly reduce the probability that their local subordinates would be targeted by anti-corruption investigations. Future research should examine in greater detail whether supreme leaders' factional subordinates tend to be reliable agents or whether subordinates often prioritize their own goals over those of supreme leaders.

N2  - As the direct responsible cadre in China’s local environmental management, the role of environmental protection bureau head (EPBH) is both critical and embarrassing. However, the profile of this group of cadres is largely unknown. This paper makes the first attempt to delineate China’s prefectural EPBHs and find several distinct features. First, although advocated by the central authority, “be younger” has not been realized in the appointment of EPBH. On the contrary, older candidates have been more favored in recent years. Second, EPBH is primarily a political actor rather than professional actor. However, they have been bearing increasing political pressure due to professional task. Third, county governments and other prefectural departments are the most important sources of EPBH, while for general environmental officials, it is very hard to be promoted as EPBH. Fourth, the promotion chance of EPBH is relatively high and most of them have been promoted to county governments and other prefectural departments. Last, the number of EPBHs removed because of dereliction has increased notably, but only a small fraction was sanctioned for poor and fraud environmental supervision. Finally, corresponding suggestions are proposed to optimize the selection, appointment, and management of EPBH.

N2  - There is increasing recognition that the development of evidence-informed health policy is not only a technical problem of knowledge exchange or translation, but also a political challenge. Yet, while political scientists have long considered the nature of political systems, the role of institutional structures, and the political contestation of policy issues as central to understanding policy decisions, these issues remain largely unexplored by scholars of evidence-informed policy making. We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies that examined the influence of key features of political systems and institutional mechanisms on evidence use, and contextual factors that may contribute to the politicisation of health evidence. Eligible studies were identified through searches of seven health and social sciences databases, websites of relevant organisations, the British Library database, and manual searches of academic journals. Relevant findings were extracted using a uniform data extraction tool and synthesised by narrative review. 56 studies were selected for inclusion. Relevant political and institutional aspects affecting the use of health evidence included the level of state centralisation and democratisation, the influence of external donors and organisations, the organisation and function of bureaucracies, and the framing of evidence in relation to social norms and values. However, our understanding of such influences remains piecemeal given the limited number of empirical analyses on this subject, the paucity of comparative works, and the limited consideration of political and institutional theory in these studies. This review highlights the need for a more explicit engagement with the political and institutional factors affecting the use of health evidence in decision-making. A more nuanced understanding of evidence use in health policy making requires both additional empirical studies of evidence use, and an engagement with theories and approaches beyond the current remit of public health or knowledge utilisation studies.

N2  - With the increased politicization of agency rulemaking and the reduced cost of participating in the notice-and-comment rulemaking process, administrative agencies have, in recent years, found themselves deluged in a flood of public comments. In this Article, we argue that this deluge presents both challenges and opportunities, and we explore how advances in natural language processing technologies can help agencies address the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities created by the recent growth of public participation in the regulatory process. We also examine how scholars of public bureaucracies can use this important new publicly available data to better understand how agencies interact with the public. To illustrate the value of these new tools, we carry out computational text analysis of nearly three million public comments that were received by administrative agencies over the course of the Obama administration. Our findings indicate that advances in natural language processing technology show great promise for both researchers and policymakers who are interested in understanding, and improving, regulatory decision-making.

N2  - This symposium is focused on the recent changes in party-group relationships in Italy. The analysis looks at the disentanglement of interest groups from parties and the autonomous role of the former in policy making. As in other European countries, since the 1980s, in Italy an accelerating decline of parties has been observed, along with a growing empowerment of interest groups. Furthermore, in the first part of the 1990s, the Italian party system collapsed giving rise to a ‘political transition’ which represented a window of opportunity for substantial turn-over in the political elite, a majoritarian electoral reform, devolution, privatization, and policy reforms in a range of important sectors. The articles in the symposium start from a policy studies perspective and analyse the expected changes in party-group relationships in three different policy areas: agriculture, pensions and transport. On the basis of a brief literature review, this introductory essay presents some general considerations on the issue of party-group relations. It then looks at their evolution and features in the Italian case, focusing on the disentanglement of parties and groups in recent years. Afterwards it outlines the common analytical framework for the subsequent contributions on different policy areas. An interesting but varied picture comes to light about the effective dynamics of party-group relations in the fragmented process of Italian policy making. Firstly we observe specific arrangements related to the number of interest organisations operating within different policy areas. Secondly, common dynamics are registered with regard to the privileged and routine relationships between groups and ministerial bureaucracies. Thirdly, the parties are no longer the gatekeepers for interest groups’ access to decision making; they no longer control the policy-making process. Within the different policy areas the authors have looked at variable configurations of factors (the salience and politicisation of issues, external inputs and Europeanization, the policy legacy) and policy-making actors in order to understand the changing relationships between new political parties and more numerous interest groups.

N2  - This paper develops a model of institutional change in order to analyze the determinants that operate on the level of institutionalization of meritocratic bureaucracies in two Latin American countries: Chile and Argentina. According to this model, the progress or degree of implementation of such meritocracies depends as much on the capacity for assertion and organization of civil society and state actors, as on the pre-eminence of a particular political and institutional framework. The empirical comparisons made by the model indicate that the intensity of presidential powers of patronage is the principal determinant of the degree of institutionalization of the meritocratic systems evaluated.

N2  - A new era in the democracy movement in Hong Kong began on July 1, 2003, when half a million people protested on the streets, and has included the 2012 anti-National Education campaign, the 2014 Occupy Central Movement and the rapid rise of localist groups. The new democracy movement in Hong Kong is characterized by a diversity of interest groups calling for political reform, policy change and the territory's autonomy vis-à-vis the central government in Beijing. These groups include lawyers, teachers, students, nativists, workers, Catholics, human rights activists, environmental activists and intellectuals. This book marks a new attempt at understanding the activities of the various interest groups in their quest for democratic participation, governmental responsiveness and openness. They are utilizing new and unconventional modes of political participation, such as the Occupy Central Movement, cross-class mobilization, the use of technology and cyberspace, and human rights activities with cross-boundary implications for China's political development. The book will be useful to students, researchers, officials, diplomats and journalists interested in the political change of Hong Kong and the implications for mainland China.

N2  - Most states have numerous paths to create security for themselves. Foreign policy-makers must recognize that their own security policy will initiate a process that structures the nature of the domestic competition over domestic and foreign policy in other countries. I contend that one state's security alternative can empower or weaken domestic actors and interest groups in opposing foreign powers. I term this process the 'second face of security' since it entails a less direct and more nuanced method of creating security (in contrast to the 'first face of security'). I apply this model to explain the intent of Britain's 'smart' or targeted appeasement policy during the 1930s - to strengthen conservative business, government officials, and economic circles in banking, light industry and finished goods, and even heavy industry in order to steer Tokyo and Berlin away from rearmament and extreme autarky.

N2  - Purpose - For some time now, research conducted in the field of human behavior and criminology has pertained to the contemporary question as to whether there are any relevant differences between the genders regarding their integrity and opinions held and, if so, which of these lead to different behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether there are any gender differences in willingness to report police misconduct and if so, what is the nature of these differences. Design/methodology/approach - In spring 2011, the study was conducted on a representative sample of 408 frontline Slovenian police officers (87.3 percent were male and 12.7 percent were female). The assessment of the code of silence was conducted using the method developed by Klockars and Kutnjak Ivkovic (2004), and consisted of 14 hypothetical scenarios describing a range of various forms of police misconduct, from those that merely give the appearance of a conflict of interest, to incidents of bribery and theft. One of the questions explored in relation to the police code of silence was the police officer's willingness to report misconduct. Findings - Authors discovered significant differences in 11 of the 14 analyzed cases on the willingness to report police misconduct. Interestingly, female police officers were less willing than their male colleagues to report different forms of police misconduct. Female police officers are less willing to report police corruption in seven cases e.g. shooting runaway suspect, supervisor abusing his/her power, excessive force - punching a suspect, falsification of evidence, supervisor not prevent beating a suspect, police officer take bribes, and doing nothing when juveniles paint graffiti. The results were further analyzed from the group dynamic in Slovenian police point of view. The survey findings could be useful for police chiefs, leaders, and managers who want to achieve the main objective of every modern police organization: to prevent corruption and increase social responsibility. Originality/value - The study analyzes, comprehensively and originally, whether the female police officers differ from their male colleagues in the level of police integrity and willingness to report the cases of police corruption and/or other forms of police misbehavior.

N2  - For companies, reputation is becoming increasingly important while at the same time, reputation is also a fundamental issue for any politician. At the European level especially, it is clear that the EU is paying attention to its reputation among citizens. Reputation has an influence on the share price of companies just as it determines a politician∈s success or defeat. But what is the significance of reputation at the intersection of business and politics - where, in the context of public affairs, there is direct dialogue between the representatives of various interests on the one hand and politicians or civil servants on the other? What are the characteristics of a good reputation that matter in context of political lobbying? How should an organisation present itself to EU institutions in Brussels in order to earn their trust?

N2  - Context: Creativity and innovation in the governmental public health workforce will be required to generate new ideas to solve complex problems that extend beyond traditional public health functions such as disease surveillance and monitoring. Creativity and innovation can promote and advance necessary organizational transformation as well as improve organizational culture and workplace environment by motivating employees intrinsically. However, there is little empirical evidence on how rewarding creativity and innovation in governmental public health departments is associated with organizational culture and workplace environments. Objective: This study describes (1) the degree to which creativity and innovation are rewarded in governmental public health agencies and (2) associations between rewarding creativity and innovation and worker satisfaction, intent to leave, and workplace characteristics. Design: The cross-sectional Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS) was administered using a Web-based platform in fall 2017. Settings and Participants: Data used for these analyses were drawn from the 2017 PH WINS of governmental health department employees. This included state health agency and local health department staff. PH WINS included responses from 47 604 staff members, which reflected a 48\% overall response rate. PH WINS excludes local health departments with fewer than 25 staff or serving fewer than 25 000 people. Results: Fewer than half of all workers, regardless of demographic group and work setting, reported that creativity and innovation were rewarded in their workplace. Most measures of worker satisfaction and workplace environment were significantly more positive for those who reported that creativity and innovation were rewarded in their workplace. Conclusion: This research suggests that promoting creativity and innovation in governmental public health agencies not only could help lead the transformation of governmental public health agencies but could also improve worker satisfaction and the workplace environment in governmental public health agencies.

N2  - This article reports the first empirical evidence that politicians delegate to trusted bureaucrats to diminish political responsibility for policy. Political science has been perennially concerned with why political leaders delegate authority to bureaucrats, but this work's focus on advanced democracies has overlooked how corruption and political influence over bureaucrats can turn delegation into a means of obfuscating responsibility. Using a measure that differentiates political corruption from corruption at lower levels of government and a new data set of policy making on more than 600 European Commission directives in the 10 former communist European Union (EU) member states, I show that political-level corruption is associated with increased delegation to bureaucrats. This relationship between political corruption and bureaucratic discretion is conditional upon the political independence of the bureaucracy, such that politicians engaged in corruption delegate more to reduce clarity of responsibility only when they possess informal means to influence bureaucrats.

N2  - President Lyndon Johnson’s appointment of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorder (Kerner Commission) followed a series of inner-city riots in the 1960s. The commission’s 1968 report, issued months before Martin Luther King, Jr.’s, assassination, famously concluded that the United States was moving toward separate societies, one Black and one White. In recent years, another version of racialized violence has garnered public attention: systemic police brutality and repeated killings of unarmed Black and Brown men by police, spawning a new civil rights movement proclaiming Black Lives Matter. Condemnation of this violence and acknowledgment of its racial content by leading public officials is now standard fare, but criminal convictions and departmental discipline are scarce. This review essay brings attention back to the institutionalized racism called out by the Kerner Commission, arguing that occasional and even chronic police violence is an outcome rather than the core problem. A more fundamental issue is a routine function of policing—protecting the mainstream United States from the perceived risk from its “ghetto” underbelly through spatial containment.

N2  - Methods: This article reviews evidence-based medicine and models of research use in policy. Then it reports the results of interviews with civil servants in the Ontario Ministry of Health, which recently adopted a stewardship rather than an operational role, incorporating many evidence-oriented strategies. The interviews focused on functional roles for research-based evidence in policy advice. Findings: The clinical context and tools for evidence-based medicine can rarely be generalized to policy. Most current models of research use offer lessons to researchers wishing to apply their work to policy but little help for civil servants wishing to become more evidence oriented. The interviews revealed functional roles for research in setting agendas (noting upcoming issues and screening interest groups' claims), developing new policies (reducing uncertainty, helping speak truth to power, and preventing repetition and duplication), and monitoring or modifying existing policies (continuously improving programs and creating a culture of inquiry). Each area requires different tools to help filter the push of evidence from researchers and set agendas, to facilitate the urgent pull on relevant research by civil servants developing new policy, and to support ongoing linkage and exchange between civil servants and researchers for monitoring and modifying existing policy. Conclusions: A functional framework for evidence-informed policy advice is useful for distinguishing the activity from evidence-based medicine and ``auditing{''} the balance of efforts across the different functional roles of research in policy.

N2  - In 2018 the Flemish Government agreed to introduce citizenship education for all students in secondary schools. This is new, since Flanders does not have an elaborated tradition of citizenship education. After a presentation of the political genealogy and the content of the new educational goals, the article analyses which theoretical framework can be used to explain this policy shift in Flanders. Conventional theories such as ‘interest groups’ and ‘rational choice’ do not serve the purpose. We argue that the policy transformation can better be explained by a combination of both the ‘path dependent explanation’ and ‘the paradigm creates politics approach’. While the paradigm shift has certainly played a big role, it does not offer the full explanation why Flanders formulated official learning goals for citizenship education. The path-way change has been initiated by a small reference in a parliamentary document to a European text in an early stage of the overall reform process of the educational goals in Flanders.

N2  - Objective: We reflect upon the processes of mental health administration in Australia with reference to George Orwell's novel,1984. Conclusions: Mental healthcare in Australia is distorted by politicisation, spin and a refusal to acknowledge the reality of the current situation. These challenges for mental healthcare demonstrate some similarities with the Ministries of Truth and Plenty, which conversely performed as their opposites in Orwell's novel. Psychiatrists and their professional bodies should play a greater role in advocacy for clinician-led, evidence-based services in partnership with our communities.

N2  - Social responsibility and organizational commitment are pillars of every public institution; They allow to manage, in a sustainable and ethical way, its relations with the internal and external environment, allowing to provide good results in municipal management and therefore achieve employee satisfaction. The main objective of the study is to determine the relationship between social responsibility and the organizational commitment of public employees of the Provincial Municipality of Huancayo in Peru. The information obtained from a questionnaire applied to a sample of 186 employees chosen at random, between men and women (authorities, officials and administrative personnel) was collated. The results indicate that there is no significant correlation between social responsibility and organizational commitment (r = 0.098, p = 0.182). It is concluded that public workers are unaware of and have indifference towards social responsibility, that is, there is no response capacity of the Provincial Municipality of Huancayo towards its interest groups. In addition, regarding the organizational commitment; Public servants do not identify themselves and do not have any level of integration with the institution, they do not become aware of the importance of certain aspects that lead them to consider their permanence or continuity in the organization and finally, they do not feel obliged to remain as employees in the organization.

N2  - This article analyses the organizational and political changes experienced by SOFOFA, the Chilean industrialist main organization. In a time span characterized by growing confrontational politics, the industrialist also implemented organizational changes in SOFOFA and engaged in a prolonged and profound debate about their relationship with the public sector. The III Industry National Conference, organized by SOFOFA and held in June 1953, marked a turning point. It signaled a much morecritical stance towards the model of capitalist modernization since 1939. Propelled by the uncertainty and the threat unleashed by the economic interventionism of the second Ibáñez administration (1952-1958), the conference brought to the fore the disagreements and the generational conflict between those members who wanted a more vigorous entrepreneurial position vis-à-vis the authorities and those who preferred to maintain the traditional lobbying methods and informal corporatist arrangements with government officials and congressmen.

N2  - This text provides a brief presentation of the Indian political system, analyzing the genesis and development of the civil servant transfer system within Indian public administration and how this interacts with the social system, the political sphere and with parliament members' political and electoral interests. This is followed by several comparisons that are established between the characteristics of the relationship between the political and administrative spheres in India and those of the system for naming people for high level positions in Brazil, taking Rio de Janeiro as our example. We argue that both the logic of the transfer system in India and the system through which people are named for high level positions in Brazil maintain legitimacy insofar as they allow ideas linked to administrative efficiency and combating corruption to be used in justifying decisions that are often motivated by political, economic and electoral interests. We also argue that analyses of the relationship between politics and public administration in both countries should not only take the design of political and electoral institutions and the postulate of electoral rationality into account but also the values that were developed throughout the process in which political institutions and public bureaucracies were constituted.

N2  - How many are the top and middle-level Brazilian federal bureaucracy appointees, and to which party are they affiliated? Are there differences among presidential mandates regarding the number of these professionals and their party affiliation? This study seeks to answer these questions, by building a new database that gathers the number of party-affiliated public officials that were appointed to Cargos de Direção e Assessoramento Superior (DAS) (position of director and high level consultant). Descriptive analysis found that the proportion of party-affiliated among appointees increased during the Workers’ Party (PT) governments and higher among appointed professionals that were not civil servant. The power-sharing among parties-mainly between the party of the president and the others-varies significantly according to the government. The partisan control over appointees is milder in middle-level and stronger at top-level positions. However, a minority of appointees are party members, even among the top-level bureaucracy. Therefore, we suggest that the political networks go beyond the party affiliations. To understand these networks it is necessary to reassess the role of party politics in shaping the executive agenda and enable reinterpretation of how presidents build and manage the government coalition and the support to their agenda in the legislative arena.

N2  - One global reality raises serious questions. Despite all the international undertakings, some 2.1 billion people (i.e. around 30 per cent of the world’s population) drink “dangerous” water that presents health risks.1 In consequence, managing to supply everyone with this essential good is not just a matter of friendly discussion between specialists, but challenges the foundations of collective action and water policies. How do we explain why, in a world where billions of dollars are invested in the entertainment or armament industries, it is not possible to develop (and finance) programmes that will bring improvements to countries where this essential good is lacking? A central hypothesis of this book is that in order to understand the problems of the water sector, the obstacles preventing its proper functioning and the inequalities that arise from them, we need to move away from debates about the legal status of the water operators - public versus private - and consider their actual practices. What do the protagonists of the water sector actually do? What actions do they undertake? Under what institutional arrangements? Both economic history and research on firms show that some companies are driven by profit, but others innovate and bring progress for a “fair” return. There may be public bureaucracies overstaffed due to patronage and clientilist practices, but also public enterprises that are competent and efficient. Ultimately, the results are explained by internal properties (professionalism) and the capacity of the protagonists to establish institutions that provide incentives and points of equilibrium between the interests concerned. In other words, one needs to focus on the practices, the frameworks in which they are embedded and the conditions of their implementation. In order to develop this line of research, we begin with two cases which, in many respects, stand at the antipodes of economic doxa: the Chongqing joint venture and the Salt River Project in Arizona. In China, the sector remains dominated by public operators, whereas in the USA one expects to find private companies; and yet both of these cases are structured around partnerships between public and private actors. The book then goes on to present four cases which, in different ways, are seen as exemplars of the theme of public-private conflict (Buenos-Aires, Paris, Berlin, Nagpur), but which prove to be much more complex in their logic. A final section is dedicated to small technical systems and to the conditions under which they develop. The aim is to see, on the one hand, what they contribute that the existing system was unable to do, and on the other, whether they offer lasting solutions. The cases studied teach us that, for progress to take place, the right skills need to be available. Although the water sector is not one of the new technological industries, it demands expertise at multiple levels, even in small decentralized systems, and the responses provided make all the difference after a few years. The overstaffing in Buenos Aires’ public company or, conversely, the results of the La Paz-El Alto cooperatives or of the small technical systems in Maputo and Ouagadougou are testament to this often forgotten factor. However, for operators - whether public or private - to be able to apply their skills, they need a legal framework and a minimum level of trust, so that they can tackle the problems and adapt their policies to the context; the urban environments in which they operate are always characterized by change, be it in demographics, the economic base or spatial characteristics. The difficulty of the exercise, moreover, is that it takes place in a situation of monopoly, which reinforces the asymmetry in the skills between firms and municipal authorities. Unless it is assumed that the operators are naturally virtuous, trust - which is necessary to action - has to be managed. This problem of rules or the regulation of the relations between public authorities and operators is at the heart of performance. The balance sought is fragile: an insufficiency of rules can encourage opportunistic behaviour, while too many can hamper action and lead to crises. This chapter will present three main outcomes of the combinatory perspective developed throughout the case studies. First, the articulation between these different factors contributes to the development of water policies and the approaches employed by operators - what we refer to as “water regimes”. Second, it sheds light on the origins and characteristics of controversies and conflicts about water; while it is true that culture (or informal institutions) explains a great deal in terms of the spontaneous acceptance or rejection of various systems, it is equally important to deconstruct institutions in order to reveal “second-rank institutions” that explain the evolution of controversies: the role of contracts, calculation mechanisms, types of report; spheres of expression, coalitions. Third, with regard to the much-discussed subject of the possible “pathways to progress” for developing countries and the choice between large and small technical systems, the cases studied cover a wide range of context-dependent solutions. © 2016 Dominique Lorrain and Franck Poupeau, selection and editorial matter; individual chapters, the authors.

N2  - This chapter examines whether the advocacy of Japan’s civil society has changed after Fukushima, focusing on the policymaking process of the Nuclear Disaster Victims’ Support Law that took place in the period from April 2011 to June 2012. There are two main reasons why this law deserves attention. First, it is one of the few cases of so-called Diet Member bills, which are submitted by multipartisan politicians and differ fundamentally from most Japanese bills, which are drafted by bureaucrats and submitted by the cabinet. Second, its policymaking process showed successful advocacy by civil society organisations (CSOs), more specifically, increased CSO involvement in policymaking after Fukushima with respect to the following six aspects: (1) establishment and expansion of a CSOs’ network, (2) CSOs’ attempts to ensure the transparency of policymaking processes, (3) CSOs’ role as intermediaries between nuclear disaster victims and policymakers, (4) CSOs’ emphasis on the illegitimacy or legitimacy of national policies, (5) CSOs’ demands for accountability from policymakers, and (6) CSOs’ roles as sources of skills and expertise. The examination is mainly based on primary sources, such as protocols of the Diet sessions and documents published by ministries and politicians, as well as interviews conducted with CSOs and politicians. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, David Chiavacci and Julia Obinger; individual chapters, the contributors.

N2  - The article examines the political potential of the Ukrainian ethnic lobby in US foreign policy. Proceeding from the fact that ethnic lobbies in the US are able to overcome the institutional system of checks and balances, the authors try to establish the extent and limits of the influence of the Ukrainian lobby. The given lobby is based on a small-numbered Ukrainian diaspora in the US, which was formed as a result of four waves of migration from the territory of modern Ukraine, due to various reasons. As a result, the Ukrainian diaspora in the United States has developed as a highly heterogeneous and multi-layered community. The main organization of the Ukrainian diaspora is the Ukrainian Committee of the Congress of America, which is an umbrella structure for organizations of economic, cultural and political profile, as well as for associations of veterans, women and youth. The Ukrainian diaspora in the US uses the following tools for political purposes. First, the diaspora organizations strive to encourage the activities of their low-and middle-ranking civil servants to form an optimal agenda. Diaspora immigrants from experts and media persons are connected to this process. Secondly, the Ukrainian diaspora has established cooperation with other Eastern European diasporas. The cooperation allows the Ukrainian Americans to use electoral potential in the states of the Northwest and Midwest of the United States and to take joint initiatives in communication with the Congress. Together, Eastern European diasporas have some influence on the American foreign policy process when it comes to the Congress, but the scope of influence should not be exaggerated. However, the demand for anti-Russian arguments is formed within the American establishment, that brings the agenda of the Ukrainian diaspora to the forefront of foreign policy debate. This allows us to conclude that the potential for political influence of the Ukrainian ethnic lobby in the United States is limited without a suitable international context.

N2  - This study investigates a virtual ad-hoc organization known as "I Stand With Henry" (ISWH). It features an individual middle school student with autism practicing selfadvocacy. His mission is to support inclusion and get his school district to sanction his ability to be included in the general education setting instead of a separate school for students with special needs. While ISWH is not an official not-for-profit organization, is performs similar functions. Through an in-depth analysis of the ISWH Facebook page, virtual ad-hoc organizations redefine what it means to be a not-for-profit organization. This study analyzes how social media gives voice to the voiceless and how social media equalizes marginalized voices for all students with disabilities to exercise their rights. The chapter employs analyzes conversations within a single case to construct a virtual advocacy model that explains the success of ISWH. © 2015, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

N2  - Scholarship on bureaucratic responsiveness to Congress typically focuses on delegation and formal oversight hearings. Overlooked are daily requests to executive agencies made by legislators that propose policies, communicate concerns, and request information or services. Analyzing over 24,000 of these requests made to 13 executive agencies between 2007 and 2014, I find agencies systematically prioritize the policy-related requests of majority party legislators—but that this effect can be counteracted when presidents politicize agencies through appointments. An increase in politicization produces a favorable agency bias toward presidential copartisans. This same politicization, however, has a net negative impact on agency responsiveness—agencies are less responsive to members of Congress, but even less responsive to legislators who are not presidential copartisans. Critically, this negative impact extends beyond policy-related requests to cases of constituency service. The results suggest that presidential appointees play an important, daily mediating role between Congress and the bureaucracy.

N2  - Obesity has become a global public health issue with increasing
prevalence rates reaching pandemic proportions. Opportunities exist for
nursing involvement in policy issues including but not limited to safe
staffing patterns, safe handling of bariatric patients, national
standards for food and beverages sold in schools, and insurance policies
for obesity. Nurses are well suited to apply their expertise and
influence in the policy process.
The policy process is a dynamic, nonlinear process that includes agenda
setting, legislation, regulation, implementation, and ongoing evaluation
involving formal and informal relationships with special interest
groups, individuals, legislators, bureaucrats, and/or political parties.
A clear understanding of the entire policy process is imperative to
successful participation in the policy arena.
Nurses have a professional obligation to advocate for clients through
participation in the policy process. Participation in the policy process
influences the direction of policy and legislation, ultimately shaping
the type of services and the environment in which clients may access
services provided by nurses and other healthcare professionals.
The purpose of this article is to provide an overview and framework for
the policy process and to elucidate steps for applying the policy
process to bariatric nursing issues. An overview of the obesity pandemic
is discussed, and the policy process is differentiated from the
legislative process with application to bariatric nursing issues.

N2  - The role of socio-political power is central to the development of policy, but systematic analyses of power associated with the development of energy policy are rare. Power is also an important yet somewhat under-researched aspect of socio-technical transitions research. The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) policy aims to increase deployment of low-carbon heat in Great Britain and begin a transformation to a low carbon GB heat system. This article analyses the socio-political power associated with the development of the RHI policy based on Lukes' `dimensions of power' approach using a methodology based on triangulation. We identify a number of policy change episodes during the development of the RHI and describe the influence of key actors on the policy. Despite the common assumption of the power of incumbents, we show that those actors with niche technological expertise, close relationships with Government actors and actors within the administration have been the most powerful drivers of policy development and change. Niche actors sped up the introduction of the RHI scheme and have also had some success in increasing relative support for biomethane injection. The power of a civil servant to slow the introduction of the domestic element of the RHI has also been identified.

N2  - Using data for 428 individual campuses in all 50 states, I show that state government funding and tuition and fee revenues at public universities depend on both political and economic factors. State government funding varies depending on the relative size of various interest groups in each state, as well as the ability of public universities to present a united front when dealing with state government. Differences in state government funding at specific campuses reflect differences in the net political benefits to political officials from the supply of instruction, academic research and public service. Net tuition and fee revenues are higher at campuses that receive less state government funding, but also higher in states where public universities have more financial autonomy. The price of attending college thus depends in part on whether the relevant decision makers are state government officials or university administrators.

N2  - Purpose - The police culture literature-suggests that police officers' attitude towards the public is characterised by Suspicion and an ``us-vs-them{''} mentality. It also refers to the moral mission of protecting the public by being tough on crime. The traditional police culture model seems to imply that these aspects are typical for the police. There is, however, a lack of empirical studies to test this proposition. The purpose of this paper is to propose a different conceptual framework, based on grid-group cultural theory (GGCT), which not only broadens the lens of the police culture model, but also allows for comparative research between different professional groups. Design/methodology/approach - The newly developed conceptual framework is tested in an ethnographic study in the Belgian police and labour inspection. The main data collection methods are observation, interview and informal conversation. Findings - The results of this study show that there are similarities in the way in which Belgian police officers and labour inspectors interact with the public, which raises interesting questions concerning the (often implicit) claim of the police culture literature concerning the specificity of police culture. Research limitations/implications - More research is needed to gain deeper insight into similarities and differences of the occupational culture in the police and comparable professional groups. GGCT offers a useful conceptual framework for such a research agenda. Originality/value - This paper addresses a number of criticisms against the classic police culture model and provides an innovative perspective to not only study aspects of police culture, but also compare the police with other professions.

N2  - Domestic political factors are often overlooked in discussions about the determinants of currency internationalisation. By studying the re-internationalisation of the Yen, our research found that the dynamic interactive mechanism between policy actors has a profound impact on the overall course of domestic currency internationalisation. In the case study, along with the establishment of the ``Prime Minister-controlled{''} model, the ``bureaucrat-controlled{''} policy process of Yen re-internationalisation led by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) experienced substantial intervention by the Prime Minister and related influences. The case study shows that Koizumi exerted pressure on the MOF and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) via budgeting power and the flexible use of resources. Moreover, the MOF and the BOJ relied on accumulated professional financial experience and the resources of legally binding independence in financial policy to successfully safeguard organisational interests and core policy concepts. Our research shows that resource exchange between the three entities helped the Prime Minister to minimise policy confrontation effectively while objectively promoting the interdependence of fiscal, monetary and financial policies, which drove sharp change in the Yen re-internationalisation policy and its long-term outlook. This case study of Japan suggests ongoing concern about the increasing politicisation of the distinctly professionalised currency internationalisation policy.

N2  - Rural governance has drawn considerable attention from both local government officials and scholars in the United States since the early 1990s. It is touted as a way to mitigate the limitations of the traditional government unit-based approaches to problem solving and decision making and to foster partnerships across both jurisdictional boundaries and sectors (public, private, and nonprofit). Established in 1962, the Resource Conservation and Development (rc&d) program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides a unique model of rural regional governance. Acting as a coalition of governments, private businesses, individuals, and interest groups, the rc&d program provides the flexibility needed to deal with issues at the appropriate spatial scale. It incorporates aspects of both grassroots and governmental organizations and can bring together local interests and expertise with governmental policy and support in service provision, problem solving, and economic development. The approach does not necessarily entail loss of power on the part of the state, but it does provide a mechanism for local people to exercise their agency, to tackle their problems, and to decide which elements of their lives they want to sustain.

N2  - The outbreak of livestock diseases in Sub-Saharan African countries is the most critical challenge affecting the development potential of the livestock sector. Vaccination campaigns are one of the most important strategies to deal with this challenge. However, such campaigns are difficult to implement due to major governance challenges, such as delays in the procurement of vaccines and the disbursement of funds. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of these governance challenges, based on a case study of a Livestock Development Animal Health Project in Zambia. The goal was to examine in detail why these problems occur and how they are linked to the implementation procedure. A novel qualitative research tool called Process Net-Map, which is a visual participatory mapping technique was applied. The tool made it possible to develop an understanding of the exact implementation mechanism and to identify the different actors involved, including government officials, private sector companies, and farmers. The study revealed that the complex design of the procurement procedure, the limited capacity of the procuring entity, and a lack of urgency among the actors involved, resulted in the procurement delays. The findings also indicate that the delay in the release of funds arises because of a diversion of funds. Some strategies to improve the efficiency of the procurement process were identified, such as increasing the sense of urgency, building staff capacity, using e-procurement and entering into framework contracts with suppliers. Building sustainable financial capacity in the overall management of public funds seems essential to deal with the challenge of fund diversion. Use of Citizen Report Cards and lobbying political decision markers are some of the mechanisms that farmers can employ to increase their capacity to hold the animal health service providers accountable and demand better services. The problems identified are not only relevant for vaccination programs but are general implementation challenges encountered in developmental programs that involve the distribution of publicly procured inputs.

N2  - While Turkey’s use of public monies has been frequently marred by waste and short-term electoral rewarding, recent research suggests that the allocation of public investment across Turkish provinces between 2004 and 2012 was more responsive to socioeconomic needs than electoral politics. The current paper aims to understand this empirical puzzle by exploring whether the ‘relatively sound’ management of public investment can be explained by the characteristics of the central economic bureaucracy. It draws on process-tracing analysis and in-depth elite interviews. In line with the developmental state literature, the analysis argues that authoritative and insulated public administrations are essential for policy effectiveness, particularly in institutional contexts prone to a high politicisation of the public purse. Yet, in order to prevent bureaucratic capture, bureaus must also be accountable. The analysis in particular shows how increasing the transparency of the state and allowing a stronger oversight of policy performance by the public and the media are extremely important. Conversely, transformations which simply reduce the powers of strong, top-down bureaucracies to increase the indiscriminate control by governments – such as the ones which have occurred in Turkey in recent years – will not lead to stronger institutions, but merely produce different ineffective and unsustainable structures.

N2  - This paper argues that the ability of dominant corporations in the fossil fuel and other polluting industries to shape government policy on climate change and energy issues is directly related to their financial interests in particular countries, and emblematic of the crippling effect which they have exercised on the ability of nation states to decarbonise. Using Australia as an exemplar of the many favourable policy outcomes which powerful corporate interests have secured from successive governments in relation to climate and energy policy, it seeks to demonstrate that covert networks of political influence have played a major role in the decisions made and actions implemented in both areas of policymaking over the last fifteen years. Through detailed empirical analysis of a database of current and former senior politicians, political staffers and bureaucrats with employment links to the fossil fuel and resource extraction industries, it argues that these industries have constructed a covert network of lobbyists and revolving door appointments which has ensured that industry interests continue to dominate Australia's energy policy, and that its emissions from fossil fuel use continue to rise. Covert corporate influence in Australia's energy and resource sectors provides an additional layer of explanation for the persistence of structural biases in its financing, policy and regulatory regimes to those accounts which draw on different forms of discourse and policy analysis.

N2  - The concept of 'politicization' of the US intelligence services, and in particular the CIA, has been debated by scholars for many years. However, it has also been easily dismissed by those investigating recent US foreign policy, as in the Robb- Silberman Commission's assurance over the 2003 Iraq War that 'the Intelligence Community needs to be pushed'. This essay seeks an extension of the critique of politicization by considering the historical context since the formation of the CIA. It seeks an application of that critique by putting forth, when evaluating the policy and operations of the George W. Bush administration, the notion of an 'alternative network' within the government. The argument is that politicization must be linked to a conception of 'Executive power', both within the American bureaucracy and in the projection and rationalization of US aims overseas. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - We analyze stock market reactions to announcements of political appointments from the private sector and corporate appointments of former government officials. Using unique data on corporate affiliations and announcements of all Senate-confirmed U.S. Defense Department appointees of six administrations, we find positive abnormal returns for political appointments. These estimates are not driven by important observations, volatile stocks, industry-wide developments or the omission of further commonly used return predictors. Placebo events for close competitors and alternative dates yield no effects. Effects are larger for top government positions and less anticipated announcements. We also find positive abnormal returns for corporate appointments and positive effects of political connections on procurement volume. Our results suggest that concerns over conflicts of interest created by the revolving door seem justified, even in a country with strong institutions.

N2  - The article presents a generalised portrait of civil governors of the Belarusian-Lithuanian Region under Paul I in 1796–1801. The social characteristics (origin, religion, age, educational level, career, awards) of eight Lithuanian, Belarusian and Minsk civil governors are analysed. The conditions and motives for the appointment and dismissal of these officials are established. It is noted that the governor corps of the Belarusian-Lithuanian Region under Paul I was characterised by both all-Russian tendencies (frequent turnover, a higher rank according to the Table of Ranks, the absence of a clearly established amount of pensions), and some features (regional and confessional affiliation, elderly age (50 years on average)). It is concluded that in the personnel policy, Paul I continued Catherine’s practice of appointing former military governors, which was explained both by political (disloyalty of part of the population) and ethno-confessional (Jews, Catholics, Uniates, Orthodox) features of the region. The daily life of governors is reconstructed on the basis of socio-cultural characteristics (number of duties, perception of time, personal qualities, material support, marital status and interests). It is concluded that the origin, patronage and military experience played an important role in the appointment. However, the duration of tenure under Paul I depended on the business qualities of the governors. It is noted that some bosses, having no managerial experience, made numerous mistakes. They led to dissatisfaction with the emperor and, as a result, to premature resignations. At the same time, the reign of Paul I turned out to be quite effective in the Belarusian-Lithuanian Region in terms of achieving managerial results. © 2022, The Belarusian State University.

N2  - This article analyzes the recurrent ``erosion thesis{''} in the governance literature, arguing that bureaucratic or procedural public-sector institutions have come to play a less significant role in public-policy formation. Evidence from the Swedish policy-making institutions referred to as ``governmental commissions{''} and adoption of the perspective of interest organizations support the claim. Using various theories of institutional change, I show that increased government control has reduced the influence of governmental commissions on policy, but not eliminated the belief held by interest organizations that the commissions are legitimate institutions.

N2  - The study of social policy in the post-war period focused on the activities of nation-states and in particular the development of welfare state institutions. During this time, the range of policy actors: politicians, bureaucrats, pressure groups and voters, all held the belief that domestic intervention could help shape the economic and welfare futures of the population, mitigating any international turbulence that arose. While the 1960s and 1970s witnessed growing interest in comparative and cross-national analysis, the nation-state still remained the basic unit of analysis in these endeavours. During more recent decades however a suite of global changes have lent social policy formation a trans-national character, with recognition that policy problems, policy processes, policy actors, and policy solutions avoid being neatly mapped onto individual nation-states. © Alan Roulstone and Colin Barnes 2005.

N2  - This article unveils a virtually unknown chapter in the history of judicial diversity in Israel. During its first 20 years of existence, between 1948 and 1968, only three Arab judges were appointed. Then, within two years, between 1968 and 1969, Israel appointed three additional Arab judges. Two interconnected changes account for this small increase in judicial diversity. First, in the 1960s, the Arab legal elite began to exert pressure on Israeli officials to appoint Arab judges. Second, perhaps partly due to this pressure, the Judicial Selection Committee made having a diverse judiciary a top priority. This historical example teaches us that without outside pressure, the Judicial Selection Committee does not look on diversity as an important consideration, using the merit system of appointment as an excuse for its failure. Indeed, up to the present day, the Israeli judiciary has relatively few Arab judges.

N2  - The political context in Indonesia will affect the success of any reform process aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). Such reforms require strong political support because of their potentially significant medium-term impact on winners and losers in the Indonesian economy. Although REDD+ in Indonesia has strong rhetorical presidential backing, analysis of the political system suggests that such support may not be sufficient without the engagement and ownership of key players such as the parliament and the bureaucracy. Not only is the president's official power curtailed by the formal political system, but the nature of coalition politics in Indonesia further weakens his ability to implement reforms. Securing the support of a coalition of parties within parliament and the bureaucracy at both national and decentralised levels may be crucial to ensuring implementation. Politicisation of the bureaucracy and increasing business-government relationships are important features of the parliamentary dynamic at the national level and are reportedly intensifying at the local level. Although public support has proved influential for other reforms in Indonesia, the public is less informed or motivated by the issues related to REDD+. In addition, the REDD+ debate is tainted by concern a about sovereignty and lack of national ownership. Building domestic constituencies for the reforms and associated institutions is therefore a key challenge. REDD+ reforms will require a stronger consensus among political elites and the broader public over the implications of a transition to a `low carbon' economy in Indonesia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Drawing on archival and personal documents from personal provenance fonds of the Russian State Military History Archive (RGVIA) and from the Research Division of Manuscripts of the Russian State Library, the article considers the circumstances of Mikhail Vasiliyevich Alekseyev's appointment Commander-in-chief of the Northwestern front and the reaction of some Stavka officials to this appointment. After the failure of the August operation Commander-in-chief of the Northwestern front Adjutant General Ruzsky petitioned for resignation because of ill health. On the same day Chief of Staff of the Southwestern front, General-of-Infantry M.V. Alekseyev was appointed to the post. After the Battle of Galicia many military officials voiced an opinion that Alekseyev should be placed not in the General Headquarters, but in charge of a front. His appointment Commander-in-chief of the Northwestern front armies was a direct consequence of a change in the Stavka strategy. The Southwestern front was to be the main attack force, and Alekseyev was to maintain its right wing and establish the defenses. However, there being two operational directions, the Stavka remained undecided on the direction of the main effort and the support role of the Northwestern front was not yet settled. The situation in the lines was difficult: the armies suffered a series of defeats, ill prepared operations and inept command of the Northwestern front exhausted all its reserves, while the German troops could reopen an offensive at any moment. M.V. Alekseyev's letters home show that even before his appointment he spoke ill of the Northwestern front command action and foresaw the complexity of the duty to stabilize the situation, duty that was imposed on him. And yet his appointment provoked a mixed reaction from the Stavka officials and the military.

N2  - In times of economic crisis, municipalities have faced serious fiscal stress and have had to implement responsive measures such as lowering operational costs, a hiring freeze or layoffs. Yet some cities even boost their bureaucratic apparatus. Based on empirical results of Czech statutory cities, it is argued, that the main cause of bureaucratic growth is party fragmentation, government alternations and weak mayors because post-communist administrations are affected by widespread patronage and clientelism. Decline or cutbacks strategies are linked to fiscal stress though in times of elections are determined by political context rather than the economic environment.

N2  - There is broad scholarly consensus that the relative power of the United States is declining and that this decline will have negative consequences for international politics. This pessimism is justified by the belief that great powers have few options to deal with acute relative decline. Retrenchment is seen as a hazardous policy that demoralizes allies and encourages external predation. Faced with shrinking means, great powers are thought to have few options to stave off decline short of preventive war. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, however, retrenchment is not a relatively rare and ineffective policy instrument. A comparison of eighteen cases of acute relative decline since 1870 demonstrates that great powers frequently engage in retrenchment and that retrenchment is often effective. In addition, we find that prevailing explanations overstate the importance of democracies, bureaucracies, and interest groups in inhibiting retrenchment. In fact, the rate of decline can account for both the extent and form of retrenchment, even over short periods. These arguments have important implications for power transition theories and the rise of China.

N2  - Background In August 2006, the Australian government announced that Herceptin (Trastuzumab) would be added to the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of government-subsidized drugs, for treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy of HER2 breast cancer. Following initial reticence, the health minister responded to a campaign by patients and patient advocacy groups by announcing PBS subsidization which lowered the cost of a weekly dose from A$1000 to A$30. The cost to the government would be A$470 million over three years for treatment of an estimated 2100 women annually. Design We analysed the news frames used in all direct and attributed statements (n=239) in television news coverage of the discourse preceding the Herceptin decision by the Australian government. Setting Five Sydney free-to-air channels between October 2005 and August 2006. Main outcome measures News frames or themes. Results Of five news frames identified, one ('desperate, sick women in double jeopardy because of callous government/incompetent bureaucracy') accounted for 54% of all reported statements. Government financial parsimony was framed as responsible for the women's plight, with drug industry pricing never mentioned. Claimed benefits of Herceptin often conflated cancer non-recurrence and survival and favoured quantification rhetoric which emphasized percentage increases in improvement rather than the more modest increases in absolute survival. Conclusions News frames invoking key tenets of the 'rule of rescue' dominated television discourse on Herceptin. Clinicians, patients, their families and patient advocacy groups invoking the rule of rescue can increase the likelihood of achieving their objective of gaining access to expensive healthcare such as pharmaceuticals. Rational, criteria-based public health policy will find it hard to resist the rule of rescue imperative.

N2  - What explains the electoral staying power of many Japanese interest. groups in the wake of electoral reform? Electoral explanations provide part of the answer; candidates in elections to both houses of the Diet continue to face incentives many of them unintended to court the organized vote. But missing from such accounts is an explanation of why economically noncompetitive groups provide the bulk of such support. The primary reason for this, I argue, is organization. As a result of their historical linkages to the bureaucracy, many interests developed hierarchical, national organizational structures that enabled them to carry out a variety of vote-gathering functions that the parties had trouble performing themselves. Although electoral reform and long-term demographic trends have weakened the electoral influence of interest groups, these organizational complementarities between groups and the parties continue to matter in Japanese elections including under conditions of two-party competition. To illustrate these points, I trace the evolution of interest group politics from the era of LDP dominance through the rise of two-party competition and the LDP's recent return to power, using postmasters associations and agricultural cooperatives as case studies.

N2  - Cybersecurity demands are forcing public officials across the globe to focus on two core values that often conflict-transparency (the public good) and privacy (citizen and private sector confidentiality). An e-survey of Florida county government officials measures how cross-pressured they are, identifies the types of information about individuals and government employees that are the most difficult to protect, examines the interest groups (public, private, and nonprofit) that act as watchdogs, and delineates the actions administrators see as critical to promoting balance. The results show intense cross-pressures and greater difficulty in protecting citizens' bioinformation, medical records, and financial data than in securing employee information. Information technology professionals and their associations are the most active in tracking privacy protection. The media and citizen activists monitor transparency the closest. More funding, personnel, equipment, and training, better software, more rigorous enforcement, and clearer standards and procedures are needed to balance privacy protection and transparency in cybersecurity policy making. © 2012 Urban Affairs Association.

N2  - The government disseminated a new constitution in 1995 with the provision on decentralization of Article 176 2 (b) that acted shortly before the rebirth of the local government act in 1997. Devolution as a form of decentralization transferred both political and administrative powers from the center to lower local councils specially to handle the responsibility of service delivery. Following the approval of the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) Act 2010, the city's administration reverted to the central government. Detractors of decentralization allege that the conveyance in the policy and legislation for change of Kampala city administration was timely because decentralization failed to deliver desired services to residents. This article contends that recentralization of Kampala city administration was a necessary evil, it decreased the autonomy of sub-national governments in civil service administration, eroded accountability to the electorates, and transferred the allegiance of the accounting officer from local governments with and for which they work to the central government that designates and positions. To inflame accountability in local governments, the article champions for the reexamining of the KCCA Act 2010 to allow power sharing between the mayor and executive director to enhance bottom-up accountability, checks and balances, and for participation of central government in appointing of executive director to allow financial and security support. It additionally requests for a reconsideration of the 9th Parliament to lobby for the amendments owing to challenges in its implementation and impact on accountability.

N2  - Although the United States (US) federal bureaucracy is plagued by high vacancy rates generally, quorum requirements and small board sizes make vacancies particularly problematic within major independent regulatory commissions. Not all vacancies, however, are created equal. By statute, some major boards allow members to continue serving beyond their original term in the absence of a confirmed replacement. The difference between an empty seat and a holdover official is important as it can determine whether a board is functional or inoperable. In this article, we examine how the presence of holdover provisions within such commissions alters confirmation dynamics and vacancy rates. Evidence suggests that holdover provisions lead to quicker confirmation on nominations as well as fewer complete vacancies. Such structures thus help mitigate the short-term problems stemming from staffing independent regulatory boards, especially given the tendency towards obstruction in the US Senate.

N2  - This work aims to demonstrate that public prosecutors are not presented as organs of the executive power, qualifying, in fact, rather, as State bodies, considered in the broadest sense of the term. In furtherance of this the inception of Public Advocacy in the Brazilian state organization and the specification of powers conferred to it by each of the constituent public institutions that comprise the list of the so-called essential functions of justice, to discuss the inherent difficulties found in the appointment of public prosecutors as organs subordinate to the executive branch and the consequent need for their qualification as constitutional organs of sovereignty. The confirmation of the thesis according to which Public Advocacy transcends the structure of the executive branch, to be set up as an organ of the State, refutes the implication (harvested from legal praxis) that its members would be forced to seek the conference of the appearance of legality of the political and administrative options preconceived by those governing and other public officials, and thus provide more effective internal control of administrative activity.

N2  - The release of government data in an open format is broadly expected to generate innovation and economic value. However, despite the emerging public notoriety of this issue, literature is still scarce regarding the commercial application of open government data. The main goal of this study is to understand how firms use open government data to create value. More specifically, we aim to identify what types of use are currently in place and which industries are more prominent in exploiting open government data. Building on the analysis of a dataset of 178 firms that use open government data across various industries in the U.S. we find twelve different atomic models. Additionally, our findings suggest that the way in which open government is used to create value is contingent to the firms' activities. Supported by robust empirical data, we anticipate that our research produces practical insights to entrepreneurs as well as firm managers in deriving value from public datasets, and equip government officials with relevant evidence for advocacy and policy-making.

N2  - Some EU agencies have been recently entrusted with enforcement powers, which imply a crucial extension of their regulatory reach. However, other comparable agencies did not receive such powers. This paper explores the case of energy regulation as an instance of these “negative” cases, and suggests that the lack of enforcement powers may have been partially determined by business interest groups. To illustrate this argument, this article firstly relies on official documentation to show that key interest groups were consistently opposed to the option of granting enforcement powers to the EU agency in charge (ACER). Secondly, it is suggested that these interest groups, which have been largely incorporated in regulatory networks during the prehistory of the agency, had access to, and exerted influence in, the governance of EU energy policy, and could plausibly have been able to concretise their preferences. A systematic examination of the representation of interest groups in the European network of energy regulators (CEER/ERGEG) during the period 2004–2011 is undertaken to corroborate this point. The conclusion draws attention to the fact that, although interest groups are less visible than other actors and their presence is less formalised, they could be very influential on decision-making processes within European networks and agencies.

N2  - Regulatory agencies have many supervisors. Congress gives them life, appropriates their money, and conducts oversight of their activities. The president appoints and can remove their senior officers, occasionally instructs them, and conducts review of many of their important actions before they take effect. Federal courts, too, supervise agencies. Statutes authorize federal courts to entertain complaints about agency action and, in the course of hearing those challenges, federal courts evaluate the legal validity of agency action. If a regulatory agency goes astray, each of these institutions has some ability to nudge it back to the proper path. These supervisors have distinct tools at their disposal to supervise agencies. Congress, on paper, has nearly limitless authority over agencies, constrained only by the Constitution. Assuming the approval of the president, or a veto-proof majority, congressional power to legislate and appropriate can be deployed to control an agency in any number of ways. It can specifically tell an agency what to do, it can generally instruct an agency, it can prohibit future action, or it can reverse past action (or all four at once). The president, by contrast, has much more limited authority to initiate agency action or to alter the agenda of an agency, but there are many crucial “implementation” decisions that agencies make that are not clearly dictated by statute, and in that space, the president can seek to work his will through his appointments and his supervision. Compared with the institutions set forth in the first two articles of the Constitution, the federal courts identified in Article III seem to have the most limited authority to supervise agency action. They are purely reactive, permitted to intervene only when a challenger to agency action seeks to invoke the authority of the federal courts. Federal judges review a tiny slice of agency actions and they are not the authors of the playbook that guides their review – the judges are guided by statutes.

N2  - The relative role of candidates, parties, and interest groups in competitive congressional elections has undergone a dramatic transformation since 1996. Before 1996, and in noncompetitive races since, candidates were the primary loci of activity in raising and spending campaign money.1 The vast majority of congressional contests are not competitive, but those few competitive races have become battlegrounds for control of Congress. The close party balance at all levels of government and in the electorate has also amplified the importance of competitive elections. We began monitoring competitive races in 1998, in response to the dramatic transformation of individual donors, political parties, and interest groups that began in 1996. The first campaign finance watershed in 1996 was the use of party soft money for candidate promotion or attack. Democratic political consultant Dick Morris, with the approval of party lawyers, developed a strategy that "by the end of the race ⋯ had spent almost $35 million on issue-advocacy ads (in addition to the $50 million on conventional candidate-oriented media)."2 The Republicans followed suit, and the widespread use of soft money to attack and promote candidates was in full swing. In our 1998 and 2000 studies we documented the surge in party soft money for candidate-specific electioneering purposes. In both election cycles, party campaign committees made the raising and spending of soft money a high priority. Unlike contributions and coordinated spending, soft money can be spent in unlimited amounts. In 2000 the parties went a step further and made it easier for donors to contribute hard and soft money simultaneously by establishing joint fund-raising committees with candidates (sometimes called victory committees). These devices allow donors in a single check to designate contributions to candidates (hard dollars), party committees (hard dollars), and party soft-money accounts. The growth of joint fund-raising committees for candidates and party committees readily permits donors to signal their candidate preferences.3 Some of the most important advantages of soft money are that it can be raised and spent by the parties in unlimited amounts, and corporations and unions can contribute treasury funds as soft money. The second campaign finance watershed in 1996 was the use of issue advocacy for specific candidate promotion or attack purposes. The American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) was the first group to mount a large-scale campaign effort, while avoiding disclosure and contribution limits. The Supreme Court in the Buckley v. Valeo decision defined election-related communications as ads that use words like "vote for," "elect," "support," "cast your ballot for," "Smith for Congress," "vote against," "defeat," and "reject."4 The AFL-CIO avoided these words but, as the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) contended in a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, the ads advocated "the defeat of a clearly identified candidate in the 1996 congressional election. "5 In 1996 the AFL-CIO spent $35 million, much of it on television, aimed at defeating 105 members of Congress, including 32 heavily targeted Republican freshmen.6 Labor ran television ads in forty districts, distributed over 11.5 million voter guides in twenty-four districts, and broadcast radio ads in many others.7 Following labor's lead, the business community mounted its own unlimited and undisclosed campaign named The Coalition-Americans Working for Real Change. Groups involved in this campaign included the National Federation of Independent Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, the National Restaurant Association, and the National Association of Manufacturers. The coalition was active in thirty-seven House races, spent an estimated $5 million on over 13 thousand television and radio ads, and mailed over 2 million letters.8 Another Republican-leaning group using this tactic in 1996 was Triad Management Services.9 The absence of action by the Federal Election Commission to bar issue-advocacy electioneering created the climate for expanded activity by these and other groups, which we have documented in past studies.10 In competitive races since 1996, spending by noncandidate entities, or outside money, has grown to rival and sometimes exceed spending by candidates. How that money is spent has also diversified to include a greater emphasis on nonbroadcast communications. We define outside money to include party soft money, election issue advocacy, independent expenditures, and internal communications. This book documents all forms of campaign communications in competitive congressional elections in 2002, including soft money and issue advocacy. In addition we include observations made while monitoring spending in a set of noncompetitive control races to establish a baseline against which to compare campaign spending in more highly charged environments.11 Much of the research in this book is the result of systematic monitoring of campaigns by knowledgeable academics from within the states or districts in our sample. Our common objective was to better understand the dynamics of campaigns and elections in highly contested environments with substantial campaigning not controlled by candidates. Each academic team created a reconnaissance network of individuals who collected mail and logged phone calls and personal contacts about the election.12 Data on political mail, phone calls, personal contacts, e-mail, and other contacts were systematically gathered. Local academics also gathered ad-buy data from radio and television stations, including cable stations, in all of our sample and control races. As a supplement to our ad-buy data, we purchased the Campaign Media Analysis Group's (CMAG) data for television advertising in our sample and control races.13 In addition, the participating academics interviewed scores of local experts, campaign staff, party professionals, and interest-group leaders in their states and districts. Likewise we conducted 134 interviews with party officials, interest-group leaders, and other experts in Washington. As a rule, these interviews were "on the record" and are cited in this book. Our 2002 project also measured voters' reactions to highly competitive campaign environments in comparison to a national baseline survey. In a separate survey voters logged their political mail and campaign contacts and provided us with all their political mail. These surveys enabled us to validate the data collection of the reconnaissance networks and to accurately measure the volume of campaign communications with voters as well as to gauge their reactions to the deluge of mail, phone calls, and in-person contacts. 14 Table 1-1 lists the congressional contests included in our 2002 study and notes the four races in which we did polling on public perceptions of the campaign and the four races in which we asked random samples of voters to record their campaign contacts and forward to us their political mail. For a more detailed description of our methodology for the 2002 studies, including the methodology for our public opinion surveys, see appendix A. For a complete list of national-level elites interviewed for this study, see appendix B. (table presented) This book builds upon similar collaborative research efforts in 1998 and 2000. In the aggregate we have now monitored eighty-one congressional general elections or presidential primary contests in 1998, 2000, and 2002. Having collected data on the full range of campaign communications over three cycles allows us to identify trends and broader patterns. A systematic monitoring of campaign finance in 2002 was important because the 2002 election marked potentially the last hurrah for soft money and at least some interest-group electioneering before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act takes effect in the 2004 election cycle. The extent to which BCRA changes the campaign finance system depends on what parts of the act survive constitutional challenge,15 how the law is interpreted during the rule-making process at the FEC16 and FCC, and the ability of interested parties to find ways to circumvent the act.17 BCRA has the potential to transform campaign finance in ways that are not yet clear to political operatives, candidates, and scholars.

N2  - This work provides an analysis of the structure and transformations of the official political debate over immigration control within the Italian political elite over the last three decades. Through a close historical reading of the Italian political scene based primarily on parliamentary debates, this article charts the key policy frames articulated in different periods of Italian immigration history in relation to the nature of the immigration control problem (cognitive dimension) and the suggested policy solutions (normative dimension). Moreover, it highlights the various factors - from party competition and political ideologies to the pressure of interest groups, the characteristics of national political institutions and the normative pressure from Europe and European institutions - that have influenced immigration policy frames and have interacted with them in shaping policy goals.

N2  - Innovation is a key factor to bring about change. The government should formulate policies that are innovative to bring change to the nation. A government that enhances transformation, is a dynamic and progressive government. The Government Transformation Programme (GTP) in Malaysia, that is implemented in three phases started in 2010, is studied to examine how the programme is being accepted by the people. GTP is a programme that has never been implemented before. This programme emphasises more on performance and results of civil servants rather than budget spending. It also emphasises more accurately on planning. The aim is to produce high levels of accuracy and accountability of public employees and to provide rapid results in a short time as desired by the people. The 2011 GTP report showed that more than three million people have been positively impacted by this programme although it has only been implemented for two years. However, empirical studies found that people did not really feel the impact of the GTP programme. Although this programme was advocated through electronic and on-line media, many people still do not understand what is exactly the GTP and what are to be achieved through this programme. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

N2  - The systemic difficulties of health care in the USA have brought to light another issue in nurse-patient advocacy - those who require care yet have inadequate or non-existent access. Patient advocacy has focused on individual nurses who in turn advocate for individual patients, yet, while supporting individual patients is a worthy goal of patient advocacy, systemic problems cannot be adequately addressed in this way. The difficulties nurses face when advocating for patients is well documented in the nursing literature and I argue that, through collective advocacy, professional nursing associations ought to extend the reach of individual nurses in order to address systemic problems in health care institutions and bureaucracies.

N2  - In 2015, 60 million people were displaced by violent conflict globally - the highest since World War II. National and international policy prevents the displaced from working or moving freely outside the camps set up to 'temporarily' house them. This policy has left the displaced with no right to work and move while they remain displaced for years, if not decades. Based on data on all 61 protracted displacement crises worldwide, fieldwork in seven conflict zones around the world, and in-depth interviews with over 170 humanitarian aid workers, government officials and refugees, the book systematically details the barriers to effective advocacy at every level of governance and shows that failure is the norm. Unlike many academic monographs, it goes further and proposes an alternative way forward that capitalizes on social entrepreneurship, crowd-funding and micro-finance to improve the lives of those that have been forced to flee their homes to find safety. © Christine Mahoney 2016.

N2  - As the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) gains relevance as a rule-maker in trade governance, understanding the reform negotiations addressing its legal framework becomes increasingly important. This article examines how domestic ideas and interests affect the reform positions of two of the DSB's most active users, emerging power states Brazil and India. Regarding domestic interests, I draw on the domestic politics and two-level games literatures to argue that the amount and favorability of domestic sectors' experience with the DSB affects their incentives to lobby during the reform negotiations. Interestingly, this results in countries pursuing liberal interests within negotiations, despite having conflicting domestic interest preferences overall. Regarding domestic ideas, I find evidence that Brazilian and Indian politicians feel accountable to voters in the negotiations, contradicting claims to the contrary in the literature. This highlights the need for more research illustrating links between voters and officials in this context.

N2  - Since the 1980s, many developing countries have enacted policies of
decentralization to create localized, representative forms of
government. A highly under-studied body of local governance are village
development committees (VDCs). Utilizing a mixed-method approach in
three districts of Southern Malawi, we combine surveys, focus groups,
and interviews to examine the role of VDCs in local politics. Selected
by their peers, VDC members navigate a complicated landscape including:
local and central politicians, government bureaucrats, NGOs and special
interest groups, and traditional authorities. We find that citizens are
accurately able to evaluate the development work that VDCs are doing and
consistently rate their trust in these institutions higher than their
trust in elected authorities. Still, challenges persist: members receive
no standardized training and there are consistent gender gaps in the
experiences of men and women members of the VDCs.

N2  - Transitional Vietnam exhibits key characteristics that economists argue are conducive to corrupt practices and, by knock-on effects, to slower economic growth. The process of liberalisation has shifted the status quo in Vietnam, permitting entry by a wider pool of bribe-takers and bribe-givers. Standard economic definitions of corruption focus on the abuse of public office for private gain, whereby corrupt practices are modelled as distortions in the distribution of government provided goods and services. This paper modifies existing models, specifying corruption as a distortion to the definition, allocation and/or enforcement of property rights. The model incorporates an explicit role for the incentive set that shapes behaviour by government officials, private individuals and firms. Abuse of public office is modelled as a distortion to property rights, including the re-assignment of private rights as the result of lobbying or rent-seeking activities. Local norms may sanction corruption against certain groups. The MNE is one case in point; others include different ethnic, religious and socio-economic groups. As outsiders in an environment historically hostile to "outsiders", MNEs represent "easy" corruption targets.

N2  - In this article, the functions of political appointees have been classified by an index on the relation between politics and bureaucracy. Based on that classification, the real states of four democracies, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Japan, have been examined. From this study, the causation consisting of the politico-administrative relation (concretely, the insider-outsider factor and the line-staff factor), the independent value, and the political appointees' functions (advice, decision-making and interface between politicians and civil servants), the dependent value, has been confirmed. Through this examination from a comparative perspective, a proposal of generalization about the political appointees' functions has been presented.

N2  - The authors argue that Russian migration policy reflects the functioning of contemporary Russia's entire bureaucratic machine. The bureaucracy's Soviet-era governance techniques on the one hand and the material interests of particular pressure groups on the other, shape the manipulation of immigration regulation that has occurred since the early 2000s. Therefore, attempts to liberalize migration regulation, i.e., to simplify the legalization of foreign workers, have always been incoherent, accompanied by reservations and limitations. Additionally, Russian actions are riddled with conflict between geopolitical' and domestic policy rationales. The authorities' occasional attempts to use immigration regulation as a foreign policy tool acquire primarily symbolic value in the domestic political market' rather than serving any instrumental purpose. The effort to enhance Russian influence in the post-Soviet space through the reintegration project' (Eurasian Economic Union) collides with the goal of national labour market protection, since integration entails the removal of barriers to labour movement.

The emergence of a neopatrimonial political order, with formal bureaucratic and administrative structures entwined with informal networks and patronage, has significantly affected attempts at aid delivery. Such dangers need to be recognized and addressed at the outset in internationally supported transitions.

N2  - Previous research has emphasized corporate lobbying as a pathway through which businesses influence government policy. This article examines a less-studied mode of influence: private regulation, defined as voluntary efforts by firms to restrain their own behavior. We argue that firms can use modest private regulations as a political strategy to preempt more stringent public regulations. To test this hypothesis, we administered experiments to three groups that demand environmental regulations: voters, activists, and government officials. Our experiments revealed how each group responded to voluntary environmental programs (VEPs) by firms. Relatively modest VEPs dissuaded all three groups from seeking more draconian government regulations, a finding with important implications for social welfare. We observed these effects most strongly when all companies within an industry joined the voluntary effort. Our study documents an understudied source of corporate power, while also exposing the limits of private regulation as a strategy for influencing government policy.

N2  - A look at the activities of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, from its inception in 1927 to 1944, with regard to licensing hotel beverage rooms in the Niagara region would indicate that the LCBO did not fully achieve its intended goal of rationalizing the public consumption of liquor. The Liquor Control Act was based on implicit and general concepts derived from the pre-prohibition concern over the morally suspect world of the saloon. Although the LCBO had been established as an objective bureaucracy, its officials, when inspecting hotels and enforcing the rules of the act, employed a language that demonstrated the persistence of the pre-prohibition value system of middle-class temperance reformers. Nevertheless, elements of the LCBO's activity illustrate clear attempts to move away from the pre-prohibition system of patronage towards something that resembled, at least structurally, the ideal, typical bureaucracy.

N2  - A range of policies has been developed in England and Wales to reform the judicial appointments process so as to promote greater diversity. But despite two decades of official activity, the pace of change has been far slower than anticipated. Increasing awareness of the intransigence of the problem has led to a greater willingness to revisit some of the more fundamental tenets which have underpinned the approach to the problem to date, in particular, the unquestioning and inflexible commitment to the principle of equal treatment. This article examines the different forms of positive action which might play a part in the development of new diversity strategies for the judiciary. It reviews the arguments for and against different types, in terms of effectiveness, quality of appointments, and equity. It goes on to consider the legal frameworks which govern diversity and equality policies and assesses the legal implications of adopting different forms of positive action.

N2  - Planned institutional change presents an uncommon opportunity for institutional entrepreneurs to advance their innovations. The dispute of why the new Israeli corporate law, enacted at the end of 1990s, does not refer to business groups, which form a salient part of Israeli big business, opens a window through which the conflict between two different and competing types of logic may be viewed. The carriers of legal-professional logic were legal academics and state officials, who opposed the inclusion of a special chapter or any other reference to business groups within the new corporate law based on US legal ideas, and especially on the 'Law and Economics' perspective. In contrast, the carriers of business logic were interest groups and professional associations that sought to appropriate the legal and economic advantages resulting from organizing business in the form of business groups within the new law, without protecting the rights of minority shareholders and, more importantly, without enabling state agencies to intervene in the governance of their businesses.

N2  - This study examines how Canada's immigration policy became the site of competing nationalist visions in the post-First World War period, when Canadians struggled with a changed sense of the nation's identity and purpose. It focuses on two groups, divided largely along gender lines: female civil servants new to Ottawa's immigration department, and Canada's leading industrialists. At the crux of the immigration debate in this period, as now, was whether cultural or economic interests should take precedence in policy. Exploring the debate in an historical context reveals immigration policy formulation to be an enterprise that responds to constantly changing social and economic systems, and relations of gender and power.

N2  - This article focuses on the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, founded under the aegis of the Nagari Pracharini Sabha in 1910 in Allahabad, and its active bid to establish what can be seen as the first archive of, and in, Hindi. While the Sammelan’s library functioned as a public-facing, community-serving space that housed and issued printed books, periodicals and newspapers in its reading room, the archive was imagined as an accumulation of all materials, print and manuscript, relating to Hindi, with access limited to critics and scholars. The article argues that infrastructure like the library and the archive critically contributed to the process of consolidation and legitimisation of the discourse on Hindi nationalism. It also traces the post-Independence assimilation of this library to the machinery of state bureaucracy, specifically to the institution of the Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sahitya Sammelan Act, 1956, and the central government’s Hindi Sahitya Sammelan Act, 1962, which declared the Sammelan ‘an institution of national importance’. How do these acts reflect tensions between the politicisation of Hindi as the national language and democratisation in post-colonial India? Here, the article shows that Hindi was not only being monetarily patronised in the 1950s and 1960s, but was also vigilantly monitored, drawing staunch resistance from the Sammelan, which saw itself as a moral alternative to the state. It traces the history of these legislative processes which ultimately resulted in a petition against the 1962 Act in the Supreme Court in 1973, which declared it invalid.

N2  - The National Newspaper Publishers Association, founded in 1940 as the Negro Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA), served two roles from the outset. As a trade organization, it sought to professionalize the Black press by holding regular conventions, improving business practices, and implementing journalism awards. As an advocacy organization, the NNPA met with sitting presidents and high-ranking government officials to push for civil rights legislation. This study, the first to document and discuss the NNPA’s dual roles, draws on organizational records, news stories, and other primary sources by and about the NNPA since its inception to illustrate the scope of its work for the Black press and equality. The historical narrative also situates the organization in the context of the Civil Rights Movement and the long struggle for equal rights in the United States. Current advocacy and trade issues are discussed in the light of this narrative and the COVID-19 pandemic, and some suggestions for improvement are offered relative to the NNPA’s eightieth anniversary in 2020. © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - The article discusses Weber’s understanding of democracy in Germany’s years of turmoil 1918/19; in particular, he elaborated it in his lecture Politics as a Vocation. Weber does not approach his theme in the traditional way: as a question of Political Philosophy, of democratic representation or in the context of a contract-theory of political rule. Rather, he interprets democracy against the background of his theory of modernization and rationalization, emphasizing the contribution of the modern state bureaucracy to the regularity, predictability, and legality of power. In this perspective, democratic politics is reduced to potentially irrational charismatic leadership and the regression in the rationalization of state administration by party machines with their patronage and prey politics. Such a perspective proved disastrous in the debates over Weimar’s constitution, in which Weber played an important rule.

N2  - Long an expatriate-run concern, leprosy control was subsumed as a key component of rural public health in the years following Nigerian Independence in 1960 by the enlisting of a cadre of African inspectors, deployed across an existing institutional landscape by a newly Nigerianized medical bureaucracy. The performative norms of leprosy control, once thoroughly colonial and suffused with the ripe vocabulary of a long-entrenched missionary diaspora, were renovated at the heart of a new concern with rural public health more broadly, as the needs, expectations and hierarchies encoded in relations between patient, court, bureaucrat and medical worker shifted and settled in accordance with new political horizons. For health workers, issues of patient and worker mobility, drug delivery, patient and community expectation, and their own physical and financial security were dramatized in a series of commentaries, complaints and reports denoting deeply felt anxieties over the viability of careers in the service of Nigerian health. This article outlines struggles surrounding leprosy control and rural public health work in the Qua Iboe Mission catchment, administered by the newly created Ikot Ekpene Medical Field Unit. It documents a shift in medical work from European missionary to national and technocratic, the foregrounding of concerns with African (worker and patient) welfare and mobility, and the emergence of novel post-colonial forms of public health advocacy and politics along the highways and byways of Ibibio- and Annang-speaking areas of southeastern Nigeria in the 1960s.

N2  - In the field of government affairs, Appointment and Dismissal Relation Extraction (ADRE) of officials from personnel news is crucial for updating government knowledge. However, ADRE faces great challenges, including extremely high accuracy demand, lack of data, tuple sparsity and conflict, and requiring incremental update. To address these challenges, we propose an Incremental Bootstrapping approach for Relation Extraction (IBRE) and apply it to real-time updating of personnel knowledge in government-affair Knowledge Graphs. IBRE starts with few seeds and trains with pattern generation, pattern evaluation, tuple prediction and seed augmentation in an iterative and incremental manner. First, we design a new strategy for defining seeds as document-tuple pairs to eliminate the effects of tuple sparsity and conflict. Then, a new definition of patterns with both word and part-of-speech is proposed to get high accuracy. Finally, we augment seeds with corrected tuples and apply incremental learning to continually improve performance with least training cost. We build a dataset called ADNP (Appointment and Dismissal News from People.cn) and compare our approach with baselines. Comparison results show that our approach performs the best. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that incremental learning continuously improves the performance of IBRE.

N2  - The lead author of this article has proposed ending civil service tenure in the U.S. bureaucracy. Yet these arguments lose their force when applied to state and local civil service systems. In many states and localities limited media scrutiny, limited political competition, the weakness of existing bureaucracies, and a relative tolerance for spoils-oriented patronage make radical civil service reform risky. We develop a ranking predicting which states make the best and worst candidates for radical civil service reform. State level independent variables include corruption, traditional party organizations, media capacity, party competition, and bureaucratic capacity.

N2  - Many people view subgovernments such as the "military-industrial complex" as largely self-governing and budget maximizing. Yet, as defense cutbacks in the 1970s and 1990s show, such networks do not maintain their privileged status indefinitely. In similar fashion, some claim public education is too autonomous and too focused on budget maximization. Others see U.S. public education bureaucracies as open systems representing their political environments, if not individual parents. This article seeks clarity by offering a preliminary definition of educational industrial complex and an exploration of its nature and size. The authors summarize the existing literature and present resource measures tracking educational industrial complex growth over time. While per-pupil expenditures have steadily increased, since World War II the increases have largely reflected gross domestic product growth. Further, while the public education student-to-staff ratio initially rose in a Parkinsonian manner, since the Reagan era that growth has moderated. Last, the educational industrial complex has lost its monopoly over policy expertise, and, to a considerable degree, reformers now dominate education policymaking circles. The authors conclude with suggestions for future research. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - This article explains the role of the IGR lobby in the passage of TEA-21 and the nature of the coalitions and partnerships formed by groups within the IGR lobby to accomplish their policy goals. The data for the study are divided into three realms. The first identifies the priorities of groups within the IGR lobby and the types of coalitions that groups entered into. These data were gathered through examinations of IGR lobby testimony before congressional committees, interviews with organizational and congressional staff members, and from secondary sources such as the official publications and websites of IGR lobby organizations. The second part seeks to gain a more precise understanding of how state and local officials use non-PIG coalitions and groups to press for their policy objectives by surveying selected state and local government officials. Finally, the survey assesses the impact that IGR lobbying had on TEA-21.

N2  - In the article the relations among the extent of New Public Management (NPM), coordination, politicization and autonomy in Lithuania are analysed based on COCOPS data (project "Monitoring public sector reforms", financed by Lithuanian Science Council, 2012-2013, agreement no. PRO-10/2012). The analysis is based on the propositions that relate coordination, politicization and autonomy in NPM and post-NPM eras. The operationalization of these variables and construction of scales are demonstrated. The analysis of averages and correlations among extent of NPM, coordination, politicization and autonomy confirms some of the postulated propositions, e.g., high politicization and high level of NPM practices are incompatible; higher managerial autonomy is congruent not only with NPM, but also with post-NPM elements.

N2  - Pesticides overuse is a serious threat to ecosystems and wildlife, human health, and agricultural sustainability. So far, however, social scientists have not produced systematic evidence on the political-economic determinants of pesticides overuse. We argue that the agrochemical industry, as a profit-motivated interest group, will only mobilize politically to avoid reductions in pesticides use when regulatory institutions are potentially capable of correcting a market failure. If regulatory institutions are weakened by corruption or other factors, pesticides overuse occurs with or without the influence of the agrochemical industry. We test this interactive theory systematically against quantitative data on pesticides use in 24 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, 1991-2003. Using corruption and other indicators to capture bureaucratic quality, we find substantively large and statistically robust interactive effects. The agrochemical industry is a crucial determinant of pesticides use in nations with low corruption, whereas the agrochemical industry has no effect on pesticides use under corrupt regulatory institutions. Troublingly, these results imply that reduced corruption may not improve actual regulatory effectiveness unless political institutions can somehow constrain the influence of special interests.

N2  - The main purpose of the paper is to investigate which factors matter for the relationship between perceptions of corruption and politicization by the public service officials at the local administration level in Poland. Four groups of factors are considered: (1) the structure of administration (2) citizen voice as an ``external{''} (to public sector) factor; (3) agency characteristics, and (4) individual characteristics. The research is based on a questionnaire survey of 858 public officials working in 10 commune councils in Poland in 2009. Within each institution, a stratified random sample has been selected at each of the following decision-making ranks: top management, middle management, are ordinary officials. The survey is based on the public officials' perceptions of the service performance governance, and institutional characteristics of the institutions they work in. The whole sample of 85 officials is divided into several sub-samples. For the whole sample as well as for each sub-sample the correlation analysis and the Granger causality test are carried out. The results reveal the differences the strength and causality of the relationship between politicization and corruption that appear in the sub-samples. The findings show that the location of a commune council has the visible impact on the officials' perceptions. The relationship between politicization and corruption is influenced strongly to the political environment in a given province. In general, causation is perceived from politicization corruption in almost all provinces where such a relationship appears. A type of a commune, the second factor included into the set named ``the structure of local administration{''}, diversifies both the strength and causality of the relationship between politicization and corruption. In a set of individual characteristics, the effect of personal honesty is superior to the effects of other factors in diversifying the officials' perceptions. Working experience also generates the differences in the officials' opinion other factors, such as age, educational attainment and sex, have considerably less impact. Regarding the agency characteristics, it is interesting that top managers and the officials satisfied by their wag (probably they belong to the same group, more or less) point out that the causality runs from corruption to politicization, while the officials of the middle rank of management think the politicization is the cause of corruption.

N2  - This article revises a conviction strongly established in the
traditional historiography of colonial music, according to which
eighteenth-century Spanish American nobility, mostly integrated by
Creole bureaucrats, miners, and merchants of low intellectual profile,
neither had artistic interests nor promoted the performance of chamber
music in the domestic milieu, by contrast with what happened with its
European counterpart. This assumed lack of interest, a result of
equating the supposed lack of sources with the absence of practice, is
based on the assumption that music making did not represent any social
value for the imaginary of the privileged estate. By means of the
examination of unpublished sources and a review of previous publications
related to the daily life and the material culture of these urban
elites, this work contributes evidence that points toward a
diametrically opposed phenomenon that allows us to reconsider the role
and significance that music making had for this social group.

N2  - This book grew out of three workshops held at the University of North Carolina Center for European Studies between October 1998 and May 2000 organized by Gary Marks, Marco Steenbergen, David Scott, and Carole J. Wilson. By the late 1990s the notion that the European Union was part of an overarching, multilayered polity was commonplace, as was the conviction that comparative politics provided a powerful set of tools for analyzing that polity. Scholars of social movements, interest groups, political parties, mass publics, legislatures, elites, and bureaucracies were drawn to the study of the European Union both to encompass it within existing theories and to refine those theories. This is the intellectual background to our project. Our goal was to bring together comparativists who could shed light on the underlying structure of conflict in the European Union and who could relate this to the conflicts that shaped politics within European countries. The project draws on two scholarly traditions: the analysis of cleavages and dimensions of contestation that stems from the work of Stein Rokkan and Seymour Martin Lipset, and the analysis of political conflict in the European Union that originated in the writings of Ernst Haas and Philippe Schmitter. At the time we were formulating this project we had the sense that we were engaging fundamentally new questions, or combining old questions in novel ways. The dimensionality of European integration and its connection to domestic contestation is indeed a relatively new topic. © Cambridge University Press 2004 and 2009.

N2  - Contemporary active labour market (ALM) reforms are pivotal in the reorganization of the welfare state as they challenge and threaten some of the fundamental achievements of labour in capitalist societies: social programmes and entitlements that compensate for unemployment, and governance arrangements in which the social partners share authority and responsibility with the state. Consequently, ALM reforms may give raise to social unrest and political struggle that involves the state (the main proponent of ALM reforms), trade unions and political parties. These conflicts are important in the politicization of reforms, i.e. raising public awareness of and engagement with controversies of welfare state change. In this article, we use a non-European perspective to ask more generally how distinct historical institutions create separate ‘politicization trajectories’ of ALM reforms, which in turn produce different policy designs and outcomes. Centring on the case of Israel, in which historically ‘abnormal’ class politics fostered indifference to the reform in both trade unions and political parties, we maintain that the preliminary de-politicization made it possible for bureaucrats to control the reform, leading to an intra-state conflict between competing agencies over its design and implementation. The usurpation of the reform by the Ministry of Finance made it conspicuously unbalanced, provoking many grievances. Paradoxically, the de-politicization of the reform advanced its re-politicization, led by non-governmental advocacy organizations in civil society. These uncommon political actors in the politics of ALM reforms were able to lead a counter-coalition, delegitimize the reform, and mobilize politicians to eventually terminate activation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Since the late 1990s, Japan’s legal system has changed as a result of changes in Japan’s economy and society as well as reforms to the postwar legal order, including changes to the system of legal training and to criminal trials. These changes have the potential to “democratize” Japanese law, in the sense that democratization is an ongoing process of broadening public participation and bringing the state into a greater degree of consultation with the society it governs.1 Lawmakers, jurists, and interest groups have attempted to democratize the law by expanding the bar, increasing lay participation in criminal legal processes, and giving more scope to public intervention in administrative decision making. Changes to Japan’s legal system have been incremental, and the reforms limited, but law, legal practitioners, and courts have the potential to play a larger role in Japanese society in the coming decade than they did during Japan’s postwar democratization and era of rapid economic growth. Law and courts are essential to the modern state. They enable the state to exercise control over society, resolve disputes between individuals, and fill in the gaps in rules made by legislators (Shapiro 1981: 1-8). A system of law that is autonomous and transparent also reassures investors and enhances the stature of a modernizing regime like Meiji Japan or reform-era China. The Meiji regime made the adoption of a European-style legal system a priority precisely because such a system was integral to ending the unequal treaty system and its extraterritoriality provisions (Haley 1991: 67ff). Japan’s post-Second World War Occupation overlaid rights guarantees drawn from U.S. sources onto legal structures and ideas imported from the civil law systems of France and Germany.2 The tension between Continental (civil law) and Anglo-American (common law) approaches to legal problems goes back to the beginning of the modern Japanese state and lives on today in the debate over how to structure legal education and administrative law (Miyazawa et al. 2008; Uga 2007). The contemporary Japanese legal system reflects this diverse intellectual heritage in its combination of code-based jurisprudence with a system of courts of general jurisdiction that enjoy broad powers of administrative and constitutional review. Despite the wide-ranging review power of courts and the rights-centered postwar constitution, Japan’s legal institutions play less of a role in politics than do law and courts in the Anglo-American tradition and are more comparable to courts in European democracies. One explanation for the relatively small role of courts and formal legal contestation is a cultural one: Japanese people prefer to resolve disputes through mediation and face social disapproval for engaging in formal disputing (Kawashima 1963). A second explanation is a rebuttal to the cultural explanation, and holds that the apparent preference for informal resolution of disputes is really a result of institutional incapacity. Japanese people may accept courts but find that resolving disputes through formal mechanisms is more costly (especially in terms of time) than resolving them through informal mechanisms (Haley 1978), and so their selection of alternative mechanisms for resolving disputes represents a rational evaluation of costs and benefits of disputing, as in other systems (Ramseyer and Nakazato 1999). In addition, political influence over Japanese courts may make them less powerful than their review powers suggest (Ramseyer and Rasmusen 1997; Law 2009). Japanese courts have played an important role in politics, though, to the extent that litigation helped frame, and put on the political agenda, issues such as employment rights for women, social discrimination, and pollution (Upham 1987). The sections that follow describe how some key institutions-the courts, the bar, the criminal justice system, and the bureaucracy-have functioned in the postwar political order and examine how the reforms to those institutions may serve to democratize them. These reforms include an expansion of the bar, the addition of professional law school to the official legal training process, the introduction of a lay assessor system for trying serious crimes, and information disclosure rules. At this point, the democratization is more potential than actual, and more public participation and access do not mean that Japan’s legal system will become more fair or more humane. Rather than serving the interests of justice, participation and access could make the legal system more punitive, more unpredictable, and more expensive (Kagan 2001).

Generic mention to bureaucrats and interest groups
N2  - Drugs are part of every society, consumed for ritual or religious purposes, for pleasure, to enhance athletic performance, or as a means to relieve pain. Throughout the twentieth century, however, an arbitrary and shifting distinction was made between legal drugs that were prescribed and administered by the medical profession, and illegal drugs that were subject to state control and suppression.Illegal in Canada since 1923, marijuana is the most controversial of illegal drugs. Because it lacks the same addictive and harmful qualities of other illegal substances, such as heroin and cocaine, marijuana’s negative social impact is questionable. In the 1960s interest groups - including university student associations, certain physicians, and others -, began demanding changes to the Narcotics Control Act, which governed the legal status of drugs, to decriminalize or legalize the possession of marijuana.In Not This Time, Marcel Martel explores recreational use of marijuana in the 1960s and its emergence as a topic of social debate. He demonstrates how the media, interest groups, state institutions, bureaucrats and politicians influenced the development and implementation of public policy on drugs. Martel illustrates how two loose coalitions both made up of interest groups, addiction research organizations and bureaucrats - one supporting the existing drug legislation, and the other favoring liberalization of the Narcotics Control Act - dominated the debate over the legalization of marijuana, and how those favoring liberalized drug laws, while influential, had difficulty presenting a unified front and problems justifying their cause while the health benefits of marijuana use were still in question. Exploring both sides of the debate, Martel presents the invigorating history of a question that continues to reverberate in the minds of Canadians.

N2  - This paper traces the development of numerical climate models in the United Kingdom from 1963, when the U.K.'s Meteorological Office first took up climate modelling, to the mid-to-late 1970s, when climate change became politicized in the United Kingdom. The central question posed is how U.K. climate modellers developed rhetoric, managed expectations, and weighed their professional and political responsibilities in the face of growing political interest in climate change. Whilst the modellers were reluctant to allow the modelling results to be used for political ends, U.K. civil servants saw climate modelling as a modern tool for a new problem. As scientific and political agendas diverged, the director of the Meteorological Office, John Mason, found himself caught between his position as a government employee in a service organization and his responsibility as a gatekeeper between climate models and their potential uses. Ultimately, as Mason and his modellers were forced to admit, their climate models became cultural and political as well as scientific objects.

N2  - Background: Brazil created Health Councils to bring together civil society groups, heath professionals, and government officials in the discussion of health policies and health system resource allocation. However, several studies have concluded that Health Councils are not very influential on healthcare policy. This study probes this issue further by providing a descriptive account of some of the challenges civil society face within Brazil's Health Councils. Methods: Forty semi-structured interviews with Health Council Members at the municipal, state and national levels were conducted in June and July of 2013 and May of 2014. The geographical location of the interviewees covered all five regions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, South) for a total of 5 different municipal Health Councils, 8 different state Health Councils, and the national Health Council in Brasilia. Interview data was analyzed using a thematic approach. Results: Health Councils are limited by a lack of legal authority, which limits their ability to hold the government accountable for its health service performance, and thus hinders their ability to fulfill their mandate. Equally important, their membership guidelines create a limited level of inclusivity that seems to benefit only well-organized civil society groups. There is a reported lack of support and recognition from the relevant government that negatively affects the degree to which Health Council deliberations are implemented. Other deficiencies include an insufficient amount of resources for Health Council operations, and a lack of training for Health Council members. Lastly, strong individual interests among Health Council members tend to influence how members participate in Health Council discussions. Conclusions: Brazil's Health Councils fall short in providing an effective forum through which civil society can actively participate in health policy and resource allocation decision-making processes. Restrictive membership guidelines, a lack of autonomy from the government, vulnerability to government manipulation, a lack of support and recognition from the government and insufficient training and operational budgets have made Health Council largely a forum for consultation. Our conclusions highlight, that among other issues, Health Councils need to have the legal authority to act independently to promote government accountability, membership guidelines need to be revised in order include members of marginalized groups, and better training of civil society representatives is required to help them make more informed decisions.

that have induced teachers and social workers to become politically
active and examine what their struggle might imply for these

interpellated and transformed. Drawing on Laclau, Mouffe and Biesta, we
find that political subjectivity emerges in situations with conflicting
norms and contradictory interpellations. When Sweden deported
unaccompanied refugee children, numerous social workers and teachers
found themselves torn between acting as loyal civil servants or acting
in accordance with their professional ethics. When representatives from
this category emerge as political subjects directed at political change,
the nation state becomes unstable and porous, creating possibilities for

N2  - The centralized nature of the Russian political system and the dominance of the executive can obscure the role played by other actors in the policymaking process. This article aims to further our understanding of the Russian policy process by examining the ability of industry to determine policy outcomes. An example from the environmental policy process concerning the introduction of the best available technology will be presented. This highly contested policy led to significant opposition from industry groups and disputes between government actors. The case demonstrates that industrial interests in Russia are able to exert considerable influence on the policy process; however, this influence is not absolute and requires closer scrutiny. Political leadership was found to be an important factor in achieving policy outcomes. However, for the most part, the policy process was found to be heavily bureaucratized, and dominated by a range of competing interests.

N2  - For decades courts have believed that only officials with ``significant authority{''} are ``Officers of the United States{''} subject to the Constitution's Article II Appointments Clause requirements. But this standard has proved difficult to apply to major categories of officials. This Article examines whether ``significant authority{''} is even the proper standard, at least as that standard has been applied in modern practice. To uncover whether the modern understanding of the term ``officer{''} is consistent with the term's original public meaning, this Article uses two distinctive tools: (i) corpus linguistics-style analysis of Founding-era documents and (ii) examination of appointment practices during the First Congress following constitutional ratification. Both suggest that the original public meaning of ``officer{''} is much broader than modern doctrine assumes encompassing any government official with responsibility for an ongoing governmental duty. This historic meaning of ``officer{''} would likely extend to thousands of officials not currently appointed as Article II officers, such as tax collectors, disaster relief officials, customs officials, and administrative judges. This conclusion might at first seem destructive to the civil service structure because it would involve redesignating these officials as Article II officers not employees outside the scope of Article II's requirements. But this Article suggests that core components of the current federal hiring system might fairly readily be brought into compliance with Article II by amending who exercises final approval to rank and hire candidates. These feasible but significant changes would restore a critical mechanism for democratic accountability and transparency inherent in the Appointments Clause.

N2  - Since the inception of the democratically elected post-apartheid government, South Africa has experienced growing numbers of protests about inadequate provision of basic municipal services. Recent studies have revealed that the poor performance of municipal officials contributes towards poor municipal service delivery. This article is based on a study which used qualitative key stakeholder interviews to analyse the performance of South African municipal officials, specifically in the delivery of services. It found that the following inter-related factors were responsible for the lack of performance: an unsupportive institutional environment, negative power struggles, over-regulation, political interference, a tense and bureaucratic environment, lack of coherent management systems, absence of a culture of excellence, poor skill utilisation, poor oversight mechanisms, weak capacity to engage in collaborations, and lack of trust between councillors from different political parties. The study concludes that for South African municipalities to meet their constitutional obligations to deliver optimal basic services to the people, the government must, inter alia, invest in building the capacity of municipal officials through the development of skills and other crucial local government interventions and transformations. The municipalities should also depoliticise local government and promote nonpartisan appointment of municipal officials.

N2  - Federal personnel may be subject to certain conflict of interest restrictions on private employment activities even after they leave U.S. government service. These restrictions, applicable when one enters private employment after having left government service, are often referred to as revolving door laws. For the most part, other than the narrow restrictions specific to procurement officials, these laws restrict only certain "representational" types of employment activities such as lobbying or advocacy directed to, and which attempts to influence, current federal officials. Under federal conflict of interest law, at 18 U.S.C. § 207, federal employees in the executive branch of government are restricted in performing certain post-employment "representational" activities for private parties, including (1) a lifetime ban on "switching sides," that is, representing a private party on the same "particular matter" involving identified parties on which the former executive branch employee had worked personally and substantially for the government; (2) a two-year ban on "switching sides" on a somewhat broader range of matters which were under the employee's official responsibility; (3) a one-year restriction on assisting others on certain trade or treaty negotiations; (4) a one-year "cooling off" period for certain "senior" officials barring representational communications to and attempts to influence persons in their former departments or agencies; (5) a new two-year "cooling off" period for "very senior" officials barring representational communications to and attempts to influence certain other high- ranking officials in the entire executive branch of government; and (6) a oneyear ban on certain former high-level officials performing certain representational or advisory activities for foreign governments or foreign political parties. This law also applies the one-year "cooling off" periods, and the restrictions on representations on behalf of official foreign entities and assistance in trade negotiations, in the legislative branch to Members of the House and to senior legislative staff, and applies the two-year "cooling off" period to former U.S. Senators lobbying the Congress. Under the provisions of an executive order issued by President Obama on January 21, 2009, full- time, non-career presidential and vice-presidential appointees in the executive branch, including non-career appointees in the Senior Executive Service, and excepted service confidential, policy- making appointees, will be subject to more extensive post-government-employment "lobbying" restrictions. All such appointees will be barred from "lobbying" any executive branch official "covered" by the Lobbying Disclosure Act (2 U.S.C. § 1602(3)), or any non-career SES appointee, for the remainder of the current Administration. Additionally, all such appointees who are "senior" officials subject to the current one-year "cooling off" period on lobbying and advocacy communications to their former agency, must now abide by such "cooling off" period for two years. Further limitations are placed upon post-government private employment activities of "procurement personnel" in federal agencies. These restrictions go beyond the prohibitions on merely representational, lobbying, or advocacy activities on behalf of private entities before the government after leaving government service, and extend also to any compensated employment for or on behalf of certain private contractors for a period of time after a former procurement official had been responsible for procurement action on certain large contracts for the government. Conflict of interest regulations and restrictions on certain private employment opportunities for a federal officer or employee do not necessarily end with the termination of the officer's or employee's federal service. This report is intended to provide a brief history and description of the provisions of federal law restricting employment opportunities and activities of federal employees after they leave the service of the executive or legislativ branches of the federal government. The conflict of interest provisions applicable after one leaves government service to enter private employment are often referred to as "revolving door" laws.

N2  - Significant changes were made by Congress to the current lobbying laws, and to internal House and Senate rules on ethics and procedures, by the passage of S. 1, 110th Congress (P.L. 110-81, 121 Stat. 735, September 14, 2007) and the adoption of H.Res. 6, 110th Congress. In the face of mounting public and congressional concern over allegations and convictions of certain lobbyists and public officials in a burgeoning "lobbying and gift" scandal, and with a recognition of legitimate concerns over undue influence and access of certain special interests to public officials, Congress has adopted stricter rules, regulations, and laws attempting to address these issues. This chapter provides summaries of the changes made to law and congressional rule in S. 1, 110th Congress (P.L. 110-81), and the changes adopted to internal House rules earlier in the Congress in H.Res. 6. The statutory and internal congressional rule changes which have been adopted address five general areas of reform: (1) broader and more detailed disclosures of lobbying activities by paid lobbyists, and more disclosures concerning the intersection of the activities of professional lobbyists with government policy makers; (2) more extensive restrictions on the offering and receipt of gifts and favors for Members of Congress and their staff, including gifts of transportation and travel expenses; (3) new restrictions addressing the so-called "revolving door," that is, post-government-employment "lobbying" activities by former high-level government officials on behalf of private interests; (4) reform of the government pension provisions with regard to Members of Congress found guilty of abusing the public trust; and (5) greater transparency in the internal legislative process in the House and Senate, including ?earmark? disclosures and accountability. Congress has adopted several significant changes in the federal law concerning the disclosure of lobbying activities by professional lobbyists, and in internal congressional rules with respect to the acceptance of gifts and travel by Members of Congress and staff from certain outside private interests, such as lobbyists and their clients. Amendments to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, and to internal House and Senate rules, were made in S. 1, passed by the House on July 31, 2007, and by the Senate on August 2, 2007, and signed into law, P.L. 110-81, on September 14, 2007.1 Additionally, changes to the internal rules of the House were made previously by H.Res. 6, 110th Congress, adopted by the House on January 4, 2007.2 © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

N2  - This chapter provides a brief overview and summary of the federal laws, ethical rules, and regulations which may be relevant to the activities of those who lobby the United States Congress. The report provides a summary discussion of the federal lobbying registration and disclosure requirements of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended by the "Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007," P.L. 110-81 (S. 1, 110th Congress); the Foreign Agents Registration Act; the issue of the propriety of contingency fees for lobbying; restrictions on lobbying with federal funds; post-employment ("revolving door") lobbying activities by former federal officials; and House and Senate ethics rules relevant to contacts with private lobbyists. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 was enacted to replace a nearly 50-year old lobbying registration law that was seen as vague and inadequate. The current lobbying registration and disclosure provisions establish clearer criteria and thresholds for determining when an organization should register its employees or staff as lobbyists or when a lobbying firm or individual lobbyist needs to register and identify clients. The act is directed at professional lobbyists, that is, those who receive payments to lobby for an employer or a client, and requires the registration and reporting of certain identifying information and general, broad financial data. In addition to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the Foreign Agents Registration Act requires the registration and reporting from those who act as agents of a foreign government or foreign political party, and who engage in "lobbying" or other similar political advocacy activities on behalf of their foreign principal. Various provisions of federal law have been enacted and regulations promulgated to restrict the use of any federal funds for lobbying purposes, either by the agencies of the federal government or by federal contractors or grantees. In attempts to limit what has been perceived to be potential undue or improper influence in governmental processes, restrictions have been adopted to limit the post-employment lobbying of certain high ranking officials of the federal government for a period of time after they leave government service ("revolving door" laws). Additionally, to deal with similar perceptions of undue or improper influence and access, both Houses of Congress have adopted internal rules regarding the acceptance of gifts and favors by Members, officers or employees of the House or Senate from private sources, particularly from registered lobbyists or agents of foreign principals, or their clients. No gifts may be accepted by Members, officers, or employees except as permitted in the rules of the respective chamber; and thus even small gifts, as well as more significant travel expenses for conferences or "fact finding" events provided to congressional Members and staff from private parties such as lobbyists and their clients, are regulated and restricted by the provisions of House and Senate rule. Under the new "ethics and lobbying" law (P.L. 110-81), registered lobbyists must be familiar with these restrictions and regulations on gifts to Members of Congress in House and Senate rules, and must certify to the Government that they have not offered gifts or things of value to Members or staff which would violate these rules. This chapter is intended to provide a brief overview and summary of the federal laws, ethical rules, and regulations which may be relevant to the activities of those who lobby the United States Congress. The report provides a summary discussion of the federal lobbying registration and disclosure requirements of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) (as amended by the "Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007" (P.L. 110-81, September 14, 2007)), the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the propriety of contingency fees for lobbying, restrictions on lobbying with federal funds, post-employment ("revolving door") lobbying activities by former federal officials, and House and Senate ethics rules which may be relevant to certain contacts by Members, officers, and employees of Congress with private lobbyists and their clients.

N2  - Public charities, religious groups, social welfare organizations and other non-profit organizations which are exempt from federal income taxation are not generally prohibited from engaging in all lobbying or public policy advocacy activities merely because of their tax-exempt status. There may, however, be some lobbying limitations on certain organizations, depending on their tax-exempt status and/or their participation as federal grantees in federal programs. Additionally, organizations (other than churches or their affiliates) which meet specified threshold expenditure requirements on lobbying activities and which engage in direct lobbying of federal officials must register employees who are paid to lobby, and must file reports on lobbying activities, under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended. As to the different categories of tax-exemption: charitable, religious or educational organizations which are exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, who may receive contributions from private parties that are tax-deductible for the contributor, may not engage in direct or grass roots lobbying activities which constitute a "substantial part" of their activities if they wish to preserve this preferred tax-exempt status. "Civic leagues or organizations not operated for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare ....," tax exempt under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(4), on the other hand, have no tax consequence expressed in the statute for lobbying or advocacy activities. (But note restrictions on 501(c)(4)'s receiving federal grants or loans). Labor and agricultural organizations, tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code, and business trade associations and chambers of commerce, exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(6), also have no specific statutory limitations upon their lobbying activities as a result of their tax-exempt status. Private foundations are generally not allowed to lobby. A provision of the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act, commonly called the "Simpson Amendment," prohibits section 501(c)(4) civic leagues and social welfare organizations from engaging in any "lobbying activities," even with their own private funds, if the organization receives any federal grant, loan, or award. Because of the definitions under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, however, the "Simpson Amendment" limitations do not appear to apply to any "grass roots" lobbying or advocacy, nor to lobbying of state or local officials, and the amendment also exempts certain other official communications or testimony. Finally, federal contract or grant money may not be used for any lobbying, unless authorized by Congress. No organization, regardless of tax status, may be reimbursed out of federal contract or grant money for any lobbying activities, or for other advocacy or political activities, unless authorized by Congress. This applies to direct or "grass roots" lobbying campaigns at the state, local or federal level (but exempts providing technical and/or factual information related to the performance of a grant or contract when in response to a documented request). The provision of law at 18 U.S.C. § 1913, as amended, as well as the so-called "Byrd Amendment," would also generally prohibit the reimbursement or payment from federal grants or contracts of the costs for "lobby" activities. This chapter is intended to provide a brief overview of the various potential restrictions or regulations within federal law on the lobbying activities of non-profit organizations. Public charities, social welfare organizations, religious groups, and other non-profit, tax-exempt organizations are not generally prohibited from engaging in all lobbying or public policy advocacy merely because of their federal tax-exempt status. There may, however, be some limitations and restrictions on lobbying by certain non-profit organizations, as well as general public disclosure and reporting requirements relative to lobbying activities of most organizations. There are, in fact, several overlapping laws, rules and regulations which may apply to various non-profits which engage in lobbying activities. In some instances, the rules and restrictions that apply may be determined by the section of the Internal Revenue Code under which an organization holds its tax-exempt status. In other instances, certain rules and regulations may apply depending on the type of non-profit organization and whether it receives federal grants, loans or awards. Finally, organizations, depending on the amount and type of lobbying in which they engage, may be required to file public registration and disclosure reports under the federal Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended. It should be emphasized that the definitions of the terms "lobbying" or "advocacy," and which particular activities may be encompassed in or excluded from those terms, may vary among the different regulations, rules, and statutes.

N2  - We develop a model of pork-barrel politics in which a government official tries to improve her reelection chances by spending on targeted interest groups. The spending signals that she shares their concerns. We investigate the effect of such pandering on public spending. Pandering increases spending relative to a non-accountable official (one who does not have to run for reelection) if either the official's overall spending propensity is known, or if it is unknown but the effect of spending on the deficit is opaque to voters. By contrast, an unknown spending propensity may induce the elected official to exhibit fiscal discipline if spending is transparent.

N2  - Research on street-level bureaucrats has identified their role as policy entrepreneurs through the adoption and advocacy of policy innovations. This article adds to this research by underscoring how street-level bureaucrats use creativity and improvisation to find contextual solutions for emergent local policy problems in response to scarcity. We suggest that these practices of policy repair allow frontline bureaucracies to deal with personnel, process, and material scarcity and maintain public service delivery even in resource-scarce environments. Using ethnographic data from Punjab, Pakistan, we show that this repair work is collaborative, client-centered, and motivated by compassion and kindness. Our research indicates that emergent and improvised policy repair allows frontline bureaucracies to be resilient and responsive to scarcity and changing service demands. Our findings further suggest that inclusion of street-level bureaucrats in formal policy decisions can help develop context-specific solutions to emergent problems of public service delivery. Practitioner Points Street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) face multiple types of scarcity during policy implementation-material scarcity, where they do not have enough equipment or space for their work; process scarcity, where officially sanctioned menu of routines or procedures do not account for local situations; and personnel scarcity, where they do not have enough workforce or expertise for their tasks. SLBs do policy repair-use creativity and innovation in their day-to-day work to find local and contextualized solutions for their localized service limitations, to overcome scarcity, and to deal with the vulnerability of bureaucratic systems. Allowing SLBs to use creativity and improvisation for local and emergent problems can create more robust and resilient public service delivery systems. Repair requires implicit and local knowledge of bureaucratic systems; inclusion of SLBs in formal policy decisions is necessary to develop context-specific solutions to emergent problems of public service delivery.

N2  - The current debate about taxing financial transactions is often presented as a brand new one. It is not. At the turn of the 19th century, a similar tax was debated in France and the US Financial actors fought the tax mightily. Those actors were very powerful. Yet, they lost. A tax on stock transfers (STT) was established. Why? Through a comparative analysis of France and the State of New York, this article argues that the tax was adopted because politicians interested in capitalizing on public discontent endeavored to publicize and frame the STT in simple and antagonizing terms. Strong but heterogeneous public hostility against finance got focused on the explicitly politicized issue of the tax. Political salience disrupted the logics of 'quiet politics' and momentarily undermined the privileged position of finance. Despite intense lobbying and threats to relocate from financiers, elected officials chose to vote for the STT.

N2  - Dilemmas are a useful concept for exploring leadership practices and decision-making process. Preserving the integrity of the state and yet to be representative-this classic dilemma is faced by Bangladeshi Public Sector Leaders (PSLs). Taking an interpretive approach, this research presents empirical insights in an important subfield of public administration, namely, lived experiences of PSL about the public sector reforms and governance practice. The researchers administered in-depth interviews and Focus Group Discussion (FGD). What emerged as the salient dilemmas of PSLs are: the dilemma of public sector leadership: the colonial legacy, power relationship dilemma in the system of government, domestic reform strategy versus donor reform strategy, public interest versus vested interest and lastly, commitment versus service to multiple stakeholders. It also identified that there is a significant presence of NPM overtones in the PSL response towards the reform programme that illustrates the prominent features of decentralization and bureaucratic entrepreneurship.

N2  - Research in the social sciences received generous patronage in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Research was widely perceived as providing solutions to emerging social problems. That generosity came under increased contest in the late 1970s. Although these trends held true for all of the social sciences, this essay explores the various ways by which economists in particular reacted to and resisted the patronage cuts that were proposed in the first budgets of the Reagan administration. Economists' response was three fold: to engage in joint lobbying with other social scientists, to tap into their authority as a respected policy player, and to influence the types of research financed by the patron. With interviews of the former lobbyist for the social scientists, the former director of the Economics program for the National Science Foundation, and a review of the archival records of economists and their scholarly society, we discuss how economists have claimed entitlement to patronage in the closing decades of the twentieth century. We observe a dynamic and productive relationship between politicians and researchers mediated by the National Science Foundation, where civil servants, lobbyist and public minded scientists, and self-serving grantees trade roles.

N2  - Citizen participation enhances urban development by contributing to the attainment of inclusive, sustainable and resilience cities. However, citizen participation is not a given because cities are arenas of conflict where different stakeholders claim their right to the city citizen participation is not a given in cities. We argue that citizen participation is constructed and influenced by multiple factors that benefit the elites while disadvantaging the poor. Three case studies (informal settlers in Hopley Farm Settlement, street vendors at Coca Cola vending site and civil society group at Monavale Vlei) in Harare, Zimbabwe were used to determine the drivers of citizen participation in urban development. Data were collected through primary and secondary data sources that include questionnaires, interviews with selected city officials and document analysis. NVivo 12 Pro enabled the thematic and content analysis of the secondary data and the interviews while Kobo data collector was used to aid the data collection and analysis from the questionnaires. The findings reveal that the legislation provide for limited `citizen' participation in urban development, especially for the poor due to the construction of citizenship. Moreover, politicians also manipulate the participation process through clientism and at times democratic channels were not considered while the lack of civic culture to participate among the citizens has also been noted. We conclude that the citizens' ability and motive to participate tends to be limited, and at times based on classism as evident from the case of Monavale Vlei.

N2  - In order to provide an account of the dominant form of policy analysis in India, we direct attention towards the relationship between the political order and the practice of policy analysis (Fischer 1993, 21), where the initially dominant developmental paradigm termed “the Nehruvian Consensus”1 created and maintained reliance upon economic-expert institutions as the primary tools of developmental policy research (Mathur 2001). From the 1950s onwards, this paradigmatic political program, framed through a technical rationality of economic development, was supported by a mainly generalist bureaucracy, whose key role was to manage the implementation of development policy in India. More recently, the growth of independent research institutions that variously play roles of advocacy and political campaigners has created a process of redefi ning of public problems. In terms of policy analysis, greater attention is paid to policy impacts at the level of target populations, and problems are increasingly reframed through a diversity of lenses, especially accounting for the protest movements against inappropriate or inadequate state action. As a challenge, socialanalyses and methodologies began to poke holes in the rigid economistic system. Governmental institutions, experts and technocrats, in this current context, have been far from successful in settling such debates, faced with alternative experts and alternative sources of evidence that bring the hard experience of policy-community interaction to the table. The space for debate about alternatives has expanded and a new generation of policy professionals, both within and outside the bounds of state institutions has helped facilitate deliberation on issues that were previously in the domain of state control. Now, technocratic claims from the establishment elites are tested through alternative empirical evidence that incorporates the lived experience and counter-factual claims of those academic-experts turned activists representing disadvantaged communities.2 Environmental struggles have particularly highlighted governmental policy failures, and brought up critical perspectives on community-based governance and the need for expert institutions to pay attention to local knowledge (Guha 1989; Baviskar 1995; Dreze et al. 1997; Nanda 1999). The move from “Government to Governance” (Pierre 2000) rather than the consequence of the “hollowing out of the state” appears in India as a political struggle to redefi ne the nature of Indian democracy, from an elite one to a more participatory polity. These set of factors, in our assessment have contributed to the nascent emergence of policy analysis as a more diverse fi eld in its own right, weakening the hegemony of economism to some extent. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - What is the impact of bureaucratic behaviors on tax rates? What is preferable: a bureaucrat or a partisan politician? Does a flypaper effect occur when lobby groups influence public policies? This article tries to answer these questions by analyzing and comparing six different models of public choice: (1) the median voter model, (2) the Leviathan model, (3) the slack-maximizing model, (4) a general model of bureaucracy, (5) the partisan politicians model and (6) a general model of lobbying. Among several results, it is shown that the median voter's income and tax share almost always play a significant role in the design of the public good/tax package, even if the government does not explicitly try to maximize the median voter's utility. The article also provides a synthesis of the positive analysis of the flypaper effect.

N2  - In considering issue expertise in policymaking, we unpack differences in the supply and types of expertise with attention to the presumed privileged role of the bureaucracy. Our empirical investigation is based on witness testimonies of congressional hearings for a policy area involving various forms of expertise - critical infrastructure protection policymaking. Three sets of findings stand out. One set substantiates the role of the bureaucracy as an important information conduit while also showing it is not a primary source of issue expertise. A second set shows how differences in issue maturity and salience affect the demand for and supply of expertise. A third set illustrates the influence of a small cadre of hyper-expertise in drawing attention to problems and solutions across different venues. These findings challenge the conventional view of the bureaucracy in policymaking while expanding the understanding of different sources of information and types of issue expertise in policymaking.

N2  - After an extensive consultation, the Scottish Executive recently published its strategy to reduce re-offending. A key component is the reorganization of the ‘Tough Option’ local authority groupings established in 2002 into eight Community Justice Authorities (CJA). With the appointment of a chief officer, directly accountable to Scottish ministers for the delivery of a local offender management plan, there is a real opportunity for criminal justice social work services (CJSWS) to build on, and learn from, Tough Option. It is crucial that CJAs use the new legislation to radically overhaul delivery of CJSW by increasingly transferring resources into the CJA and taking direct responsibility for service delivery. This article sets out the background to the consultation, outlines the proposed changes and suggests how these could lead to more effective CJSW services.

N2  - While the Spanish Inquisition has laid the greatest claim to both scholarly attention and the popular imagination, the Roman Inquisition, established in 1542 and a key instrument of papal authority, was more powerful, important, and long-lived. Founded by Paul III and originally aimed to eradicate Protestant heresy, it followed medieval antecedents but went beyond them by becoming a highly articulated centralized organ directly dependent on the pope. By the late sixteenth century the Roman Inquisition had developed its own distinctive procedures, legal process, and personnel, the congregation of cardinals and a professional staff. Its legal process grew out of the technique of inquisitio formulated by Innocent III in the early thirteenth century, it became the most precocious papal bureaucracy on the road to the first "absolutist" state. As Thomas F. Mayer demonstrates, the Inquisition underwent constant modification as it expanded. The new institution modeled its case management and other procedures on those of another medieval ancestor, the Roman supreme court, the Rota. With unparalleled attention to archival sources and detail, Mayer portrays a highly articulated corporate bureaucracy with the pope at its head. He profiles the Cardinal Inquisitors, including those who would play a major role in Galileo's trials, and details their social and geographical origins, their education, economic status, earlier careers in the Church, and networks of patronage. At the point this study ends, circa 1640, Pope Urban VIII had made the Roman Inquisition his personal instrument and dominated it to a degree none of his predecessors had approached. © 2013 University of Pennsylvania Press.

N2  - The chapter first discusses the logic of lobbying of the European Commission by interest groups. The rest of the discussion is divided into three parts. The first section highlights the organizational and cultural characteristics of the Commission bureaucracy and the implications of these characteristics for groups seeking to develop effective lobbying strategies. The second section examines in detail recent attempts by the Commission to structure and institutionalize interest group consultation; this analysis highlights the increasing importance of both 'thin' and 'thick' consultative structures. The concluding section briefly considers the utility and limitations of group pluralism within the Commission and asks whether the neo-functionalist predictions have, in the event, turned out to be surprisingly accurate.

N2  - Endogenous policy models usually neglect that government policies are frequently the result of decisions taken at different tiers by different agents, each enjoying some degree of autonomy. In this paper, policies are the outcome of the choices made by two agents within a hierarchy. A legislator decides on the budget to be successively spent by a bureaucrat. Both agents are lobbied by one or two interest groups. The combination of sequential decisionmaking and lobbying implies that the interaction between the agent at one tier and,the interest group(s) depends on the exchange between the same interest group(s) and the agent at the other tier. Our results concerning multi-tier lobbying and legislatorial oversight substantially qualify the conventional wisdom related to one-tier lobbying. In particular, the reaction of the legislator to lobbying at the bureaucratic tier may make lobbying wasteful even when there is no competition from other lobbies. Moreover, the legislator benefits from lobbying only when there is competition between interest groups at the upper tier. It is also shown that competition for influence at the bureaucratic tier may work as a perfect substitute for legislatorial oversight. Extensions of the model indicate its usefulness for the analysis of decisionmaking in other multilevel governance structures, like federations or firms.

N2  - Does public participation matter in planning? Although the paradigm of participation has strengthened, its practical implementation is not always successful. Critical literature stresses that public engagement is often ineffective since planning choices are mainly influenced by the most affluent groups. While most studies focus on collaborative or innovative cases of participation in urban design and transformation, this article focuses on local comprehensive planning and the statutory involvement of the public and interest groups. To assess their influence, their access to the planning process is analysed with data from a survey of elected officers and staff in the municipalities of the largest region in Italy. It is inferred that the access for non-governmental actors predicts the latter’s impact on policy decisions. Participation from citizens and stakeholders through the formal and legally regulated mechanisms does not seem to be empty rhetoric: their contributions appear to be taken into consideration. In most cases, they manage to make an impact on decision-makers by collaborating with them, while confrontation is seldom experienced. Residents and economic associations are the most influential players, while political parties are the least prominent ones. This implies that particular interests and expectations, manifested by many residents and stakeholders, may hinder policymakers striving to plan for the wider community’s benefit.

N2  - This paper explores organisational factors that contribute to the under-representation of women in senior leadership positions in the education sector with a particular reference to Community Secondary Schools (CSSs) in rural Tanzania. Interviews and focus group discussions were used to collect data from 182 participants (20 school heads, 160 teachers, one Regional Educational Officer and one District Educational Officer). Findings revealed that there is gender bias, sexual harassment, favouritism, and discrimination in the process of recommending and appointing heads of schools in rural Tanzania. The findings further showed that the education training policies of 2014 do not consider gender equality in appointing heads of schools. Furthermore, in many instances male school heads were reported to sexually harass women staff before they were recommended for leadership. The findings further revealed that women teachers were less supported by their fellow women leaders in recommending them for leadership positions. Thus, the study recommends that a sexual harassment policy should be established by the government to discipline leaders who misuse their office in exercising power. In addition, the study recommends that the Educational Policy of 2014 should be reviewed to stipulate a gender balance in the appointment of heads of schools.

N2  - That Cameroon is a plural society whose politics of ethnic and regional balance has been exploited by certain individuals and groups for parochial considerations is already a well-documented fact. This paper adds another dimension to a profound understanding of this political reality by focusing on what is generally known in the national political lexicon as "motions of support." These are letters addressed to the President of the Republic by the elite of a specific ethnic group or region of the country whenever one of their members is promoted to an important position in the State bureaucracy, or state-owned enterprise that places the individual in a position to benefit himself and members of the group that he represents. The objectives of these letters are threefold: (1) to thank the President for compensating the region and its people; (2) to pledge the group's continuous and unflinching political support to the President; and (3) to remind the President that this pledge is a function of his ability to ensure a steady flow of "development projects" to their region. A content analysis of some of these motions of support would enable us to place them within the context of the politics of exclusion, and to emphasize that by giving vent to ethnoregional sentiments, Cameroon's body politic hinges on a system of patronage that is systematically melting away the unity of the country. © 2004 by Association of Third World Studies, Inc.

N2  - Do legislators from marginalized groups have non-electoral motivations
to represent `their' group? Previous observational and experimental
research on this question focuses on elected politicians and is thus
unable to isolate representation absent a desire to win re-election. We
address this limitation by observing the decision-making of appointed
legislators who, by institutional design, have no personal re-election
motive. We administered to Canadian senators and their staff a novel
survey instrument that captured how they prioritized learning about the
policy opinions of various groups of citizens. We show that senators'
group identities-specifically, those associated with racial and regional
minorities-influenced which group's views they chose to learn about. The
findings refine the central conclusion of the literature and have
implications for the study not only of unelected legislators but also of
elected officials in settings where public monitoring is weak.

N2  - In Canada, researchers, policy-makers and non-governmental organisations have re-conceptualized the school setting as being an ecological entity, linked to parallel ecologies of the homes and the community it serves. The school, public health and other systems that seek to deliver programs in that setting are open, loosely coupled and bureaucratic. This reconceived view of the school as a setting for health promotion leads to an emphasis on building organizational, system, professional and community capacity. One of the most effective ways of building such capacities when resources are scarce is to invest in a variety of formal and informal networks that can sustain themselves with little or no external resources. A number of recognised researchers from the health and education sectors have emphasized this systems-based approach and the need to build supportive, small-scale networks or learning communities. In recent health promotion research, networking at various levels, across sectors and within communities is viewed as a key strategy within new, more effective health promotion strategies. In education, the notion of networking for educational change has been described as "learning communities" for continuous school improvement. The authors suggest that this strategy of networking be used at the international level to address several global challenges: There is no single, convenient way to obtain basic information about the status and nature of national and state/provincial school health programs around the world. There is no global research agenda in school health promotion, despite the obvious value of sharing such research and knowledge. There is no global mechanism to facilitate the development of common or shared tools for surveillance of child/youth health and monitoring of school health policies and programs, despite the excellent work being done in individual countries and by the European Network of Health Promoting Schools. There is no international mechanism with a focus on school health that brings together the following stakeholders: educational organisations with public health organisations; researchers with government officials and practitioners; those who work in Spanish, English, French and other languages; issue-specific networks with health generalists. An invitation is given to government officials, researchers and national school health associations to join an informal International School Health Network (ISHN) (soon available at: www.internationalschoolhealt.org). Discussions about the formation of the ISHN have been held with a number of participants at several international meetings and have culminated in a fledgling network that will focus on electronic and web-based exchanges of information, developing a global school health research agenda, exchanging effective materials and tools, informing policy-makers about effective practices, policies and programs. This network would build on and not duplicate the work of existing networks and include participation from WHO, OECD, UNESCO, the IUHPE and the World Bank. The next large meeting of the ISHN will occur at the IUHPE 2007 Conference in Vancouver, Canada (www.iuhpe conference.org). Before then the ISHN will organise several on-line projects and teleconferences. For more information, contact dmccall@jcsh-cces.ca.

N2  - This article starts from a crux in Alan Thomas's model of development management: that values-based development management may require the coercion of employees whose values are different. It uses a case study of Sri Lanka's attempt to inculcate the value of impartiality in staffing, focusing on the restoration of the independence of the Service Commissions. The article concludes that values-based management is likeliest to succeed in the public sector, whose democratic legitimacy allows politicians to impose values in the form of behavioural norms. Ironically, such management is more complicated in the NGO sector, whose uncertain legitimacy means that managers must negotiate values with staff who may have competing values of their own.

N2  - North Korea is often characterized as some form of highly centralized rule: totalitarian, posttotalitarian, corporatist, or personalistic. This article argues that much of the confusion around understanding North Korea's actions stems from misplaced models. Much of the current thinking on North Korea's politics does not account for the limited institutional plurality in the system. The article documents how the state's political institutions have changed since the country's founding and highlights the formal and informal roles of each major bureaucracy today. The Korean Workers Party and the role of Juche have declined, but the National Defense Commission and "military-first politics" have not taken their place as reigning supreme. Rather the interaction between the Korean Workers Party, military, and cabinet helps explain and moderate policy outcomes.

N2  - This article traces the development of Barack Obama's sometimes ambiguous and sometimes antithetical attitudes and relationship to lobbyists. During his childhood in Indonesia, his stepfther was a lobbyist for a US oil company. Obama engaged himself in what many would consider to be lobbying in his career as a 'community activist' in Chicago. As an Illinois state senator, he befriended lobbyists and enjoyed poker and basketball games with them, in addition to raising about two thirds of his campaign finance from big business, unions, and political action committees. In the US Senate, Obama involved in ethics reforms that curbed the influence of lobbyists. His presidential campaign rhetoric was hard-hitting, often decrying the irresponsibility of lobbyists while he had a number of lobbyists in key positions in his campaign team. On his first full day in office, President Obama signed an executive order restricting lobbyists from working in his administration. He later banned registered lobbyists from having personal meeting with officials about economic stimulus projects. Both these pledges have, however, had unforeseen or unwelcome consequences. More recently, Obama decided to ban lobbyists from membership of federal advisory panels but continues to meet frequently with favored lobbyists and corporate executives behind closed doors. The article questions whether Obama's history in this area adds up to a coherent or principled track record or whether it simply relates a series of inconsistent and political decisions.

N2  - Lobbying is a significant component of the modern politics industry in Britain, but we know relatively little about its historical origins and evolution. This article draws on parliamentary debates and three databases which together account for 51 newspaper titles, in order to explore how lobbying was discussed in parliament and the media between 1800 and 1950, and to gauge the growing professionalisation of lobbying. Perceptions of lobbying became somewhat less negative over the period; there are relatively few reports or allegations of corruption associated with lobbying; and lobbying by the railway industry seems to have been less substantial, while public sector lobbying was more significant, than is commonly supposed. Direct advocacy with policymakers is overwhelmingly the dominant tactic used by lobbyists of the period, with few reports of coalitions or grass-roots campaigns. Particular concerns were expressed about the influence of lobbying around private bills. While lobbying back-bench MPs and parliamentary committees (rather than ministers and civil servants) accounted for over 80\% of the activity revealed across the whole period, there are signs by the middle of the 20th century that the focus of lobbyists is beginning to turn away from Westminster and towards Whitehall. The article paints a detailed view of the scale, scope, and significance of lobbying as it was developing into a national and systematic industry.

N2  - Despite a good deal of interest in lobbyists' tactics, virtually no research has been published examining the conditions under which interest groups lobby the bureaucracy rather than or in addition to the legislature. Using two comprehensive datasets, I show that lobbying increases in both branches when conflict is higher and when the lobbyist has professional or political connections to that venue. In addition, certain conditions cause lobbyists to specialize in one branch or a particular branch only, depending on the issue area being lobbied, the interest group type being represented, the lobbyist's resources, and other factors.

N2  - In the lobbying literature, the effects of competition-two or more interests lobbying on opposing sides of a policy debate-have not been assessed with regard to government agency policymaking. Consequently, neither the amount nor the effect of competitive lobbying is well understood. Using nearly 1,700 comments on 40 federal agency rules, we evaluate two questions: Do government agencies respond to lobbying by changing agency policies? and Does lobbying on one side of a policy issue beget lobbying on the opposing side? We demonstrate that agencies change the content of final rules in favor of the side that dominates the submission of comments. Thus, it seems the ``squeaky wheel gets the grease'' during rulemaking. We find no evidence, however, of counteractive lobbying during agency rulemaking. Our results suggest that interest groups may further their policy goals by observing more closely the actions of opposing groups during agency policymaking.

N1  - From Duplicate 1 (Essentials of American government - McKay, David)

Generic mention to interest groups and bureaucracy,

There are two chapters dealing with these themes - separatedly.
N2  - Essentials of American Politics is an undergraduate text with a novel analytical and comparative focus. It takes as a central theme the increasing tension in American politics between a general philosophy of limited government and particular public demands for more and better government programs and services. While this has always been a feature of the American polity, recent events have brought it into sharp focus. Both a Republican Congress and Democratic president extol the virtues of less government but continue to grapple with demands for improved education, health care, transportation and almost every other area of social and economic life. All praise the virtues of lower taxation and at the same time promise improvements in the quality of public services. A similar tension applies in the courts, in state politics and indeed throughout the system. Recent successes such as a balanced budget have been achieved in part because the limited government philosophy has been on the ascendant and has won support from all shades of political opinion. But conflicts over the distributional questions of who gets what has hardly subsided.In few other democracies is this tension as well defined as in the United States and Essentials reminds readers of this fact through comparison with democratic processes in other countries, and in particular with European countries.Essentials weaves this theme into a discussion of American national politics. Up to date and well organized chapters are devoted to beliefs and values, the Constitution, federalism, Congress, presidency, the federal bureaucracy, interest groups and the courts.

N2  - This article draws lessons about environmental justice from a case study in the Jordan River Valley of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Building on notions of justice as recognition, the article argues that inclusive environmental justice agendas require the recognition of multiply marginalized groups and the fundamentally different understandings of environmental hazards and benefits they may have, and it proposes the use of intersectional analysis to do so. The village of al-Auja faces severe water-related challenges: a closed Israeli military zone blocking access to the Jordan River, which has also shrunk and grown polluted in recent decades; water wells with declining capacity and increasing salinity and a lack of permits to rehabilitate them; and the drying of a once-perennial spring. Residents, local government officials, and Palestinian staff members of a transborder nongovernmental organization agreed in identifying Israeli occupation as a key cause of water stress and articulated justice-based protests. However, while some emphasized the lack of Palestinian sovereignty over natural resources, others concentrated on the obstruction of villagers' agricultural livelihoods and household hardships. The article demonstrates that different life experiences, particularly along lines of rural/urban residence, career, and gender, shaped divergent definitions among Palestinians of environmental benefits and harms, and thus different priorities for environmental justice work. It suggests that attending to complex, intersecting lines of social experience in the early stage of environmental campaigns, when defining problems and forming goals for improvement, can lead to more representative reparation plans, institution building, and activist agendas.

N2  - This study examines the impact of neoliberal policy—which introduces competition for funding and pressure to professionalize and bureaucratize—on the working conditions and precarity of a purposive sample of southern Ontario (Canada) organizations dealing with LGBTQ + health. Findings from semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 20 community-based organization stakeholders and government bureaucrats confirmed that neoliberal policy pressures these organizations to professionalize and bureaucratize, while restricting political advocacy. Queer Liberation Theory’s three central tenets of anti-assimilationism, solidarity across movements, and the political economy of queer health are used to understand the situation and possible futures for third-sector organizations within the LGBTQ + movement. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Tourism trade associations play a critical, though little understood role in tourism policy development and implementation. As the direct conduit between industry and government, associations seek to develop a reciprocal arrangement with government departments, senior bureaucrats and elected officials with the goal of influencing policy to either benefits their members or minimise damage to them. This paper examines the role of tourism trade associations in government relations activities by analysing the roles played by different types of provincial associations in Canada. The study found that, depending on their size, associations liaised with more than 20 different government departments on a wide array of issues. However, their direct links are closest with tourism departments.

N2  - Research Summary We conducted a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of a social interaction training program to determine its effectiveness in improving attitudes and behaviors among police officers. Survey data and a series of difference-in-difference tests found that participating in the training program improved attitudes with treatment group officers placing higher priorities on procedurally fair communication during a hypothetical officer-citizen encounter. An interrupted time-series analysis of official use-of-force reports provided no evidence that the training program altered officer behavior. Policy Implications Policing scholars and reformers have increasingly called for improvements to police training that emphasize communication and de-escalation skills. Although many programs addressing these issues exist, evidence of their effectiveness has been scarce. Our findings provide evidence that such training may improve police officer attitudes but perhaps not behaviors.

N2  - The system for monitoring, regulating and reporting on the way in which UK government ministers make appointments to the boards of public bodies is a relatively neglected area of public management. A decade after the establishment of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA), little attention has been paid by academics to the functioning of this agent of accountability (a particularly British device), despite the importance of transparency and accountability for the new public management and modernization. This article seeks to examine the key issues surrounding the Commissioners for Public Appointments as agents of accountability, by examining the tensions in the relationship between OCPA and the executive, variations in the governance arrangements for the Commissioners across the devolved polity and the key findings and recommendations of a number of official reports, while locating these issues in the context of current debates about modernization and `representativeness' in public bodies.

N2  - When do states forge technological change in mature industries? This article challenges the emphasis on bureaucratic autonomy in explaining the ability of governments to promote technological change. We show that structural features of the bureaucracy alone are insufficient to account for variation in policy intervention, and argue that sectoral patterns of interest intermediation shape state capacity. Political coordination leads industry and government to broker technological transformations in consensus-driven negotiations. This prioritizes the interests of incumbent firms, likely resulting in regulatory capture and weak policy intervention. Political competition among interest groups and state agencies, by contrast, allows policy-makers to organize coalitions of technology challengers, likely leading to strong policy intervention. We examine this argument in the case of electric vehicle policy in Germany and the United States. Germany failed to disrupt its auto sector to transition to electric vehicles, while the United States adopted comprehensive policies for the manufacturing and commercialization of electric cars against incumbent opposition. Counter to conventional wisdom, our findings suggest that states can effectively engage in sectoral intervention to drive technological change in the absence of autonomous bureaucracies.

N2  - State capacity is central to the provision of public goods, including
environmental protection. Drawing on climate policy making, this article
argues that the division of labor between the bureaucracy and
legislature in policy formulation is a critical source of state
capacity. In cases of bureaucratic policy design, the legislature sets
policy goals and delegates policy design to bureaucracies. This division
of labor shifts distributional conflict to autonomous bureaucracies,
allowing for effective policy design. California followed this path in
climate policy making, setting it on track to meet climate goals. In
cases of legislative policy design, bureaucracies set goals and
legislatures design policy measures. Since legislators have incentives
to respond to vested interests, legislative policy design is vulnerable
to regulatory capture. In Germany, legislative policy design in climate
policy making is preventing attainment of emissions reduction goals, as
industry interests succeeded in blocking key policy measures. Our
findings highlight procedural sources of state capacity.

N2  - The growing presence of Muslims in Spain sets new demands and strains that examine the ability of Spanish society to accept "other" religions and "other" cultural practices. Based on a concept of interest groups, we can expect the creation of associations representing those interests. This paper analyzes the collective behaviour and configuration of interests of Muslims in the city of Granada. We rely on two case studies to draw our conclusions: first, the long Muslim claim to have an Islamic cemetery and, secondly, the tense negotiations about "el Día de la Toma". We have used a qualitative methodology based on interviews with key players and references to local press, official documents and private reports. We provide some conclusions: first, in regard to their organization, we must understand the Islamic communities -varied, numerous and not always connected- as the most representative interlocutors. Second, their influence will be characterized by their (to date) outsider position, something that will prevent them from developing high-impact, short-time strategies. And third, continuity in claims leads them to achieve, in whole or in part, their goals.

N2  - This article examines the way in which the construction of a "gang" problem and the resulting "gang statistics" in a particular community, referred to as Bigcity, are related to the local political context and the police accommodation of political interests. In particular, the political accountability of the police impacts on police recordkeeping practices and the statistics regarding "gangs" that those records generate. The organizational career of gang statistics, from the citizen's call to the police response and subsequent recordwork, is examined in order to demonstrate how the recordkeeping practices of the police bureaucracy facilitate the social construction of the "gang" problem. Field research data, including calls to the police, ride-along observations, and interviews, illustrate how the politicization of the "gang" problem impacts on police recordkeeping and the social construction of "gang statistics." Given that the current concern about the nationwide growth of gangs is based on such statistics and that gang suppression efforts call for enhancing and sharing gang databases, the role of police practices in shaping gang statistics is an important issue.

T1  - Forging fiscal reform: Constitutional change, public policy, and the creation of administrative capacity in Wisconsin, 1880-1920

N2  - At the turn of the twentieth century, Wisconsin, like many northern industrial states, faced a profound fiscal challenge. As one concerned citizen succinctly explained, "The two great administrative problems before our people at this time are, first, the control of corporate wealth, and, second, the establishment of a rational system of taxation."The largescale structural pressures created by the rise of corporate capitalism and the decline of an obsolete tax system forced all levels of government to re-examine the substance and administration of their fiscal policies. At the state and local level, many governments addressed the mismatch between the increasing demand for state services and the declining supply of revenue by turning to new levies and innovative forms of administration. In confronting the impending fiscal dilemmas, Wisconsin was a leader in forging fiscal reforms. Political activists, lawmakers, and other government actors in the Badger State led a turn-of-the-century property tax revolt when they sought to replace the aging, locally administered general property tax with a graduated income tax managed by a centralized, administrative bureaucracy. After a long and arduous process, reformers were able in 1911 to enact the first effective state-level income tax that would soon become the model for other states and even the national government. Although the income tax did not become a wholesale replacement for the general property tax, its limited success was achieved in part because tax reformers overcame numerous institutional barriers as they helped promote a more equitable and effective distribution of fiscal burdens. By confronting the entrenched power of political parties, state constitutional constraints, and cultural resistance to centralized authority, activists and politicians established an institutional beachhead for the subsequent development of a new fiscal order-one that was guided not simply by the need for greater revenue but by concerns for equity and economic and social justice. Because the campaign to use progressive income taxes as a complete replacement for the property tax was ultimately unsuccessful, the turn-ofthe- century tax reform movement reveals both the limits and accomplishments of fiscal reform. The inability of Wisconsin's lawmakers to relinquish their reliance on the property tax was perhaps a missed opportunity during a unique period of political plasticity. But the income tax campaign did initiate the incremental process of diminishing Wisconsin's dependence on property taxes. Indeed, by the end of the 1920s, the income tax generated a significant portion of the state's revenues. Still, the income tax did not become the dominant source of subnational government revenue throughout the country, as some reformers had envisioned. Over time, as part of the institutional compromise of federalism, different levels of American governance divided the sources of tax revenue. By the end of the twentieth century, the federal government would come to control most income tax revenue, state governments would rely on a combination of sales and income taxes, and local governments would be left primarily with property taxes. Despite the limited success of the income tax, the early twentiethcentury tax reform campaign had a durable impact on the administration of public finance. Since the property tax was embedded in the nineteenthcentury state-level system of "courts and parties," activists seeking to make taxation more transparent, rational, routinized, and fair inevitably had to confront the local process of tax administration.3 In challenging the dominance of the locally administered property tax, reformers wrestled power away from local political parties and consolidated it in the hands of elite professional experts. They attempted, in the process, to alter the popular and cultural perception of local self-government, which at the time valorized local administration by party officials as an established part of the nation's republican traditions. This essay investigates how and why tax reformers in Wisconsin were able to help build the administrative capacity to levy new forms of taxation but were unable to replace the property tax with a progressive tax on income. Other studies of state and local tax reform during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era have had little to say about the peculiar persistence of the property tax, and even less to say about Wisconsin's administrative achievements. Those scholars who have examined the political history of Wisconsin's tax reforms have generally elided the development of administrative capacity; instead, they have depicted the new tax laws and policies as the consequences of newly formed interest groups or coalitions that sought to recalibrate tax burdens by increasing taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals.4 By contrast, others have explained the emergence of the Wisconsin income tax as an apolitical solution to the technical problems posed by the dysfunctional property tax.5 Scholars who have explored state and local tax reforms more generally have frequently noted the persistence of the property tax, but given their broad comparative analysis they have not attempted to explain why particular tax policies within specific states crystallized or wasted away. In analyzing the qualified achievements of the Wisconsin income tax movement, this essay provides a glimpse at a larger narrative about the dramatic structural transformation in American public finance that occurred at the turn of the twentieth century. The tax reforms that were enacted in Wisconsin and other northern industrial states not only presaged changes at the national level; they also reflected a broader and more fundamental revolution in American state-society relations. Although graduated income taxes, both at the national and state level, had modest beginnings-with low marginal rates and high exemption levels affecting only the wealthiest of taxpayers-they were, as the legal historian Lawrence Friedman has noted, "the opening wedge for a major transformation of American society."7 By reallocating the burdens of financing a modern industrial democracy, this new form of fiscal governance was concerned with redefining the meaning of modern citizenship, facilitating a fundamental change in existing political arrangements, and underwriting the emergence of the modern American liberal state.

N2  - After the gaining of independence by Ukraine the scientific interest to liberation struggle has been constantly growing. The opening of accesses to archives has promoted the strengthening of the interest to the activity of OUN and UPA. The open aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine has activated researches on the Ukrainian liberation movement of the mid XX century. Scientific cognition of this issue is predetermined also by the absence of generalising works that would concern not only the particular question of personnel supply of MD - 24 ``Makivka{''}, but also the features of functioning of this structural UPA unit on the whole. However; the source base allows researches to clarify this problem in a proper way. Still, at first sight, a significant amount of scientific researches on the history of the Ukrainian liberation movement, in which separate aspects of the given problem have received illumination, does not provide grounds to speak about the presence of its complex scientific elaboration. A special separate research on the personnel structure of the headquarters staff of Military District (MD)- 24 ``Makivka{''} is absent. At the same time, it is necessary to underline that die complexity of illumination of these aspects is predetermined by the originality of the insurgents'activity and, also, insufficiency of the source base. The article's purpose is to establish the personnel fullness of structural links of the headquarters staff of MD-24 ``Makivka{''}, and to trace their rotation. In article for the first time on die basis of unknown and little-known archival documents and materials the personnel fullness of the Tactical Division 24 ``Makivka{''} (1944 - 1949) is clarified. It has been defined, that despite underground conditions and constant losses of the administrative board staff, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) management tried to fill in vacant posts adhering - at the same time - to the principle of appointment of the educated professional cadres with the insurgent struggle experience. The author has elucidated the question of quantitative fullness of administrative bodies. The article proves that during its existence, the headquarters staff of - initially - MD - 5, and then TD (Tactical Division) - 24 ``Makivka{''} (1944 - 1948), was headed by the following persons: 1) the commander of MD - 5 ``Makivka{''} Ivan Beleiovych-{''}Dzvinchuk{''} (01-11.1944); 2) die deputy commander of MD - 5 ``Makivka{''} Ostap Karantyts `kyi-{''}Mors'kyi{''} (12.1944 - 01.1945); 3) the commander of MD - 5 ``Makivka{''} Adam Kurovyts'kyi-{''}Siryi{''} (02-05.1945); 4) die commander of TD - 24 ``Makivka{''} Dmytro Vitovs'kyi-{''}Zmiyuka{''} (06.1945 - 03.1946); 5) the commander of TV ``Shchyt{''} ``Bohdan{''} (04-10.1946); 6) deputy commander of TD ``Roman{''} ``Romko{''} (11.1946 - 08.1947); 7) the commander of TD Stepan Stebers'kyi-{''}Khrin{''} (08.1947 - 09.1949).

N2  - The Maternal Death Surveillance and Response system (MDSR) was implemented in Ethiopia in 2013 to record and reviewmaternal deaths. The overall aim of the system is to identify and address gaps in order to prevent future death but, to date, around 10\% of the expected number of deaths are reported. This article examines practices and reasoning involved in maternal death reporting and review practices in Ethiopia, building on the concept of `practical norms'. The study is based on multi-sited fieldwork at different levels of the Ethiopian health system including interviews, document analysis and observations, and has documented the politicized nature of MDSR implementation. Death reporting and review are challenged by the fact that maternal mortality is a main indicator of health system performance. Health workers and bureaucrats strive to balance conflicting demands when implementing the MDSR system: to report all deaths; to deliver perceived success in maternal mortality reduction by reporting as few deaths as possible; and to avoid personalized accountability for deaths. Fear of personal and political accountability for maternal deaths strongly influences not only reporting practices but also the care given in the study sites. Health workers report maternal deaths in ways that minimize their number and deflect responsibility for adverse outcomes. They attribute deaths to community and infrastructural factors, which are often beyond their control. The practical norms of how health workers report deaths perpetuate a skewed way of seeing problems and solutions in maternal health. On the basis of our findings, we argue that closer attention to the broader political context is needed to understand the implementation of MDSR and other surveillance systems.

N2  - It is only possible to talk of actual Italian administrative elites when referring to the period following national unification (1861-1900). Over the course of the 20th century, these elites have come to occupy a somewhat lower social position. In this paper, the fascist era and the first years of the Republic are discussed. The first law on senior civil servants was not adopted until 1972, and even then it had limited scope. Since the 1993-1998 period, when contracts were introduced for civil servants and then senior officials, those in senior management positions continued to be too close to the world of politics, and a system of patronage was introduced. In the absence of any proper training, new public management is only a superficial notion, and the average age of senior officials is still high, despite an intake of young people who have been recruited after doing competitive training courses.

N1  - Insights on methodology

Exclusion criteria: language (Russian)
N2  - Studying informal aspects of politics in Russia and post-Soviet states more broadly has become an influential research trend. The concepts of clientelism and informal networks often serve as a theoretical framework for such an analysis. Despite obvious connotations, students of informal networks only rarely take advantage of methodological tools provided by Social Network Analysis (SNA). They not only allow scholars to visualize a network and to calculate its basic statistic characteristics, but also puts forth more rigorous requirements for the operationalization of the informal network, thereby making it a logically conceptualized category and not just a metaphor, as it is often presented in the literature. By using SNA tools, the presented paper studies informal networks of administrative elites of the Sverdlovsk Oblast. Having experienced a relatively rapid economy recovery following the collapse of the USSR, the region’s success in bargaining with federal elites over the advancement of its legal status in the 1990s and long-term into the office of its first governor brought forth explanations that emphasize the power of elite networks in this region. This article aims to test these assumptions quantitatively. To that end, we analyzed informal networks of the heads of the executive agencies and provided three temporal snapshots. These correspond to the terms of the two governors that held the office: Eduard Rossel and Alexandr Misharin. The informal networks were based on biographical data, which we collected and recorded into the database. This database consists of 665 rows, which contain information on the career paths of 78 officials. After identifying the intersections of the career paths of these individuals prior to them occupying elite positions, we built networks based on them. We have analyzed the structures of these networks, their density, the presence of communities, and centrality measures, which allowed us to see how different the patterns of the networks can be depending on the strategies of their leaders.

N2  - Objective: To examine characteristics associated with tenure length of State Health Officials (SHOs) and examine reasons and consequences for SHO turnover. Design: Surveys of current and former SHOs linked with secondary data from the United Health Foundation. Setting: Original survey responses from SHOs in the United States. Participants: Respondents included SHOs who served between 1973 and 2017. Main Outcome Measures: Tenure length and consequences of SHO turnover. Results: Average completed tenure among SHOs was 5.3 years (median = 4) and was shorter in recent time periods compared with decades prior. Older age at appointment (beta = -0.109, P = .005) and those holding a management degree (beta = -1.835, P = .017) and/or a law degree (beta = -3.553, P < .001) were each associated with shorter SHO tenures. State Health Officials from states in the top quartile for health rankings had significantly longer average tenures (beta = 1.717, P = .036). Many former SHOs believed that their tenure was too short and reported that their departure had either a significant or very large effect on their agency's ability to fulfill its mission. Conclusions: State Health Official tenures have become shorter over time and continue to be shorter than industry chief executive officers and best practice recommendations from organizational researchers. States have an opportunity to consider and address how factors within their control influence the stability of the SHO position.

N2  - Recent presidential reliance on acting agency officials, including an acting Attorney General, acting Secretaries of Defense, and an acting Secretary of Homeland Security, as well as numerous below-Cabinet officials, has drawn significant criticism from scholars, the media, and members of Congress. They worry that the President may be pursuing illegitimate goals and seeking to bypass the critical Senate role under the Appointments Clause. But Congress has authorized and Presidents have called upon such individuals from the early years of the Republic to the present. Meanwhile, neither formalist approaches to the constitutional issue, which seem to permit no flexibility, nor current Supreme Court doctrine, which contributes few bounds on acting officials, satisfactorily answer how much latitude a president should have to work around Senate confirmation. After summarizing different methods Presidents have used to rely on unconfirmed officials to perform the work of Senate-confirmed offices, this Article advocates a functional approach to the constitutional question. A functional approach to acting officials possesses the twin virtues of pragmatism and constraint. Presidents have legitimate needs to rely briefly on unconfirmed individuals, but functional considerations, including the need to ensure the integrity, competence, and democratic responsiveness of senior agency officials, weigh against long-term reliance on such individuals. The Article concludes that because the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 authorizes overly lengthy service, the Act, together with other practices, is constitutionally problematic. The Article concludes with reform recommendations.

N2  - We use social network analysis to better understand historic data on the administration of local governments. Despite advances in e-government applications, the public sector lags behind in analytics because information is locked in legacy data formats. Can e-government researchers bridge the gap between legacy data and analytics? We argue that computational analytic methods, popular in big data applications, can explain patterns that have gone unquestioned in previous research on government. Specifically, we consider how explanations of state government authority can be explained using a network perspective. These data were originally designed to describe administrative differences US territories and states. We investigate methodological challenges in building a weighted social network to confirm existing measures for calculating the power of the state governor. This project reports on the initial step in a broader study to cover all 50 states across multiple years and agencies. We compare the states that experienced the greatest differences in gubernatorial appointment power between 1992 and 2012 Texas and Massachusetts. In addition, we identified that Information Systems agencies moved closer to gubernatorial control across all 50 states. Social network analysis improves existing measurements because it indicates the relationship between the governor and other top officials and agencies. An analytics approach explained where the power shifted across states and across time. Computational analysis of existing government data matches findings from previous studies as well as adding additional explanatory power.

N2  - Private for-profit home care providers have grown unevenly in Europe and through varied processes. Yet, more research focusing directly on private providers is needed to identify and explain European patterns in their growth and in their modes of operation. This paper examines the case of Ireland, where private providers have grown significantly in recent years and transformed the national landscape of domiciliary care. First, it is shown that the amount of public funding received by private providers increased from euro3 million in 2006 to euro176 million in 2019, in contrast to amounts allocated to non-profit and public providers that have increased only slightly. Second, those trends are explained through policy analysis and by drawing on in-depth semi-structured interviews (n= 12) with private home care providers and government officials who have been central to the privatization of care. The paper gives a direct voice to key figures in private home care, and through a critical reading of interview materials, argues that the neoliberal nature of the Irish state has driven the growth of private provision, in particular, through policies of competitive tendering and fiscalization. Providers' own lobbying activities have also played a role, albeit a secondary one. Ireland has traditionally followed a laissez-faire, family-based system comparable to Southern European countries. Its experience is thus directly relevant to that region, but further research should also compare and contrast the development of private providers operating in other European long-term care regimes.

N2  - How do we best defend the rule of law against its attackers, both within the European Union and outside of it? Often, the rule of law has been perceived as a domain belonging to jurists, lawyers, bureaucrats, or politicians. Yet at its most fundamental, the rule of law needs to be thought of from a citizen's perspective. When enforced, it guarantees freedoms and liberties for citizens and enables us to live peacefully. In this article, we propose a citizen-centric rule of law agenda based on a deep conviction that it is if and when it becomes a citizen-based societal principle that its many attackers are best countered. We discuss the challenges and necessities of rule of law promotion and propose an assessment approach called the "living list". We close with a call for citizen-scholars to fight for the rule of law, the most precious human invention of all time.

N2  - This study draws on the insights of managers in the behavioral health treatment system to explore the value of persons who bring lived experience to their organizational positions. Within these organizations, persons with relevant lived experience occupy various nonclinical and clinical positions. When facilities incorporate workers with lived experience, managers observe increased levels of trust between clients and service providers, an enhanced client-centered perspective among service providers, and higher quality in the services provided. This study may guide managers in considering how (or whether) human service organizations might institutionalize lived experience as a mechanism to help create a representative bureaucracy.

N2  - When are interrogators exempt from criminal responsibility by the imperative to acquire information that might save lives endangered by terrorist attack? This article uses the Israeli example to show that aspects of security policy previously assumed to be based on independent foundations actually results from political bargaining. Interrogation of terrorist suspects is governed instead by bargaining between political leaders, civil servants and interest groups, all of whom function in an environment conditioned by non-governability, judicialization, and an alternative political culture. This article examines tensions between human rights and domestic security through a detailed analysis of the dispute over interrogation methods by the Israeli General Security Service (Shin Beth), which resulted in the Israeli High Court of Justice's Interrogation Decision of 1999. While most studies deal with security culture as a belief that determines polices, this article elaborates on the input of various political actors who operate within a complex of variables. The article examines the alternative culture in Israel that has a powerful effect on the creation of public security policy. The gridlock created by competing governmental institutions has prompted judicial intervention in many areas. Faced with a paralysed government, interest groups have created an alternative political culture, stressing action through the courts. Accelerated judicial activism has the effect of diminishing respect for the law in the eyes of the public.

N2  - This article deals with the Israeli land policy in light of a certain judicial decision made by the Israeli High Court of justice (HCJ). A decision known as the ``Land decision'' (2002). Following the concept of shared mental models I will claim that the ruling of the HCJ at the given point in time expresses societal preferences formed through a process of learning through which society develops a shared mental model of `alternative behavior' that reflects the way in which individuals and groups adapt to solve the social problems they face in various contexts. This shared mental model provides a frame of reference for the actions of political players such as politicians, special interest groups as well as the Supreme Court in shaping the design and implementation of Israel' land policy. However regarding the Israeli land decision the ability of the Supreme Court to determine policy is limited on the implementation level.

N2  - This article seeks to explain why civil service reform trajectories have differed in post-communist Europe, and why reforms have so far not led to the de-politicisation of personnel policy. It argues that the communist legacy of over-politicised personnel policy, the mode of transition and the constellation of actors after the first free elections shaped the personnel policy and civil service reform dynamics in the period directly after the change of regime. However, in terms of reform outcomes, the road to de-politicisation of post-communist civil services posed too many obstacles to lead rapidly to successful reforms. Neither governments of the left and the right nor new generations of senior bureaucrats have an incentive to engage in efforts to de-politicise post-communist civil services. The context of post-communist transformation has tended to lock in a pattern of civil service governance that is characterised by high levels of political discretion.

N2  - This article examines the status of historical legacies in debates on the reform of public administration in East Central Europe. It identifies limitations of existing accounts and derives three dimensions for the further development of legacy explanations of administrative reform in East Central Europe. First, legacy arguments tend to zoom in on the negative effects of the communist past. Yet there is not one but many legacies that matter for post-communist reforms and these many legacies have to be carefully distinguished and conceptualized. Second, legacy explanations tend to search for broad similarities between the administrative past and the present set-up of East Central European administrations in order to demonstrate the importance of the legacy. The identification of similarities is, however, not sufficient for the identification of legacy effects. Instead, the article argues in favour of the identification of causal mechanisms of legacification to explain recent administrative developments in East Central Europe. Finally, the article draws attention to the interaction of legacy effects with other determinants of administrative reform such as European integration and political parties. Points for practitioners This article addresses primarily policy-makers who deal with the reform of public administration in Central and Eastern Europe. It addresses the issue of how administrative traditions and, generally, historical legacies affect the design of administrative reforms and the successful implementation of reforms. Conventional wisdom concentrates on the negative effects of the communist-type administration on contemporary reform in Central and Eastern Europe. This article advances a more differentiated perspective on the impact of historical legacies. It argues that communist administrations evolved over time and differed considerably across countries. The administrative experience of other historical periods further interacts with the communist legacy of the past. The article also identifies various mechanisms that help to `transport' the legacy of the past into the contemporary administrative reform context. For administrative policy-makers this approach implies that they cannot take for granted that the effect of the communist legacy is identical across countries and they cannot even assume that the communist administration will be long-lasting after transition. Instead, it is recommended that the specifics of local administrative traditions and the kind of mechanisms that produce legacy effects in the context of contemporary reform efforts be examined more closely.

N2  - This chapter examines party patronage in Hungary. It argues that party patronage reaches into all areas of the public sector. Political appointments are relatively more important for the ministerial bureaucracy than for executive agencies and executing institutions such as state-owned enterprises. They are more common at the top of institutions, predominantly for the sake of politically controlling the policy process. The chapter shows that party patronage varies across sectors. Three patterns are distinguished. They are labelled as 'captured sectors' such as the Media, 'partially disciplined sectors' such as Finance and Economy, and 'partially insulated sectors' such as the Judiciary. The chapter concludes that party patronage contributes to the stabilization of parties and party systems in Hungary. Yet patronage increases corruption risks in the public sector, breeds popular distrust in political parties, and hence runs the risk of being self-defeating for the parties that rely on it. © Petr Kopeckỳ, the estate of Petr Mair, and Maria Spirova 2012.

N2  - The development of RHPOs in Hungary is closely related to the broader context of post-communist transformation. Two features of RHPOs in Hungary are particularly striking. First, RHPOs have undergone steep increases since the early 1990s. Yet reward levels for most high public offices remain low compared to private sector salaries. Second, especially the institutional basis of RHPOs in public administration is characterized by instability, discretionary governance and large variable bonuses, which can amount to 50 percent and more of an offi- cial’s take-home salary. Variable pay instruments have typically been introduced under the heading of performance-related pay (PRP). In particular, since 2004 when the businessman Ferenc Gyurcsány was appointed Prime Minister of a Socialist-Liberal government there has been a growing infl uence of new public management ideas on RHPOs in Hungary. The discussion will show however that the Hungarian PRP system is mistrusted by civil servants and vulnerable to politicization. © 2012 Marleen Brans and B. Guy Peters, editorial and selected matter.

N2  - Recent debates on the transformation of the state in Central and Eastern Europe have centred on the impact of political competition on state politicisation. The presence of robust competition, including coherent governments and critical oppositions are said to reduce the potential for state politicisation. This article challenges this perspective. It concentrates on the impact of patterns of government alternation on senior civil service politicisation. The article emphasises problems of political control of senior bureaucrats, which are argued to emerge after regular wholesale alternations between ideological blocs as opposed to other types of alternations. The article relies on data from an expert survey that was conducted in eight Central and Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004. It develops an index of politicisation that captures the range and intensity of senior civil service politicisation. It then conceptualises senior civil service politicisation as a mode of governing the postcommunist state and traces the variation in politicisation to patterns of government alternation in Central and Eastern Europe since their transition to democracy. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Background: In Colombia, public health policies to improve food environments, including front-of-pack nutrition labelling and marketing restrictions for unhealthy products, are currently under development. Opposition to these policies by the food industry is currently delaying and weakening these efforts. This opposition is commonly known as 'corporate political activity' (CPA) and includes instrumental (action-based) strategies and discursive (argument-based) strategies. Our aim was to identify the CPA of the food industry in Colombia. Methods: We conducted a document analysis of information available in the public domain published between January-July 2019. We triangulated this data with interviews with 17 key informants. We used a deductive approach to data analysis, based on an existing framework for the CPA of the food industry. Results: We identified 275 occurrences of CPA through our analysis of publicly available information. There were 197 examples of instrumental strategies and 138 examples of discursive strategies (these categories are not mutually exclusive, 60 examples belong to both categories). Interview participants also shared information about the CPA in the country. The industry used its discursive strategies to portray the industry in a 'better light', demonstrating its efforts in improving food environments and its role in the economic development of the country. The food industry was involved in several community programmes, including through public private initiatives. The industry also captured the media and tried to influence the science on nutrition and non-communicable diseases. Food industry actors were highly prominent in the policy sphere, through their lobbying, close relationships with high ranking officials and their support for self-regulation in the country. Conclusions: The proximity between the industry, government and the media is particularly evident and remains largely unquestioned in Colombia. The influence of vulnerable populations in communities and feeling of insecurity by public health advocates is also worrisome. In Colombia, the CPA of the food industry has the potential to weaken and delay efforts to develop and implement public health policies that could improve the healthiness of food environments. It is urgent that mechanisms to prevent and manage the influence of the food industry are developed in the country.

N2  - In the past, food industry actors tried to delay and weaken public health efforts to promote adequate and healthy diets in Brazil. This study aimed to identify the political strategies used by food industry actors in Brazil. We undertook a document analysis of publicly available information and interviews with eighteen key informants in public health nutrition. Data collection and analysis were carried between October 2018 and January 2019. In Brazil, food industry actors interacted with health organizations, communities, and the media. They disseminated information on nutrition and physical activity by scientific events and schools. The food industry also had allies within the government and lobbied high ranking officials. Finally, food industry actors intimidated some public health professionals, including by threats of litigation, which had the effect of silencing them. These strategies were facilitated by the use of arguments, such as the crucial role that the food industry plays in the economy and its support to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Personal responsibility, moderation, and education were cited as solutions to the obesity epidemic, and there was little discussion on the broader issue of inadequate and unhealthy diets. Food industry actors in Brazil used a diverse range of political strategies, which have the potential of negatively influencing public policy, research, and practice in the country. Learning about these strategies is an essential first step, and in response, it is crucial to develop robust mechanisms to address undue influence from corporations.

N2  - Background In the business literature, the term ``corporate political activity{''} (CPA) refers to the political strategies undertaken by corporations to protect or expend their markets, by influencing, directly or indirectly, the policy process. There is evidence that food industry actors use such political practices, which poses a significant threat to public health. Our study objective was to identify the political practices of the food industry in Chile. Results In Chile, food industry actors supported community initiatives, particularly those targeted at children and those focused on environmental sustainability. Food industry actors also funded research through prizes, scholarships, and by supporting scientific events. Food industry actors lobbied against the development and implementation of a front-of-pack nutrition labelling policy, including with support from the Ministries of Economy, Agriculture and Foreign Affairs. Food industry actors, for example, claimed that there would be unintended negative consequences for society and the economy, and that the policy would breach trade agreements. The same arguments were used against a proposed tax increase on sugar-sweetened beverages. Food industry actors stressed their crucial role in the Chilean economy and claimed to be part of the solution in the prevention and control of obesity, with a particular focus on their efforts to reformulate food products, and their support of physical activity initiatives. Interviewees noted that the political influence of the food industry is often facilitated by the neo-liberal and market-driven economy of Chile. Nevertheless, this system was questioned through social protests that started in the country during data collection. Conclusions In Chile, food industry actors used numerous action- and argument-based CPA practices which may influence public health policy, research, and practice. Despite strong influence from the food industry, Chile adopted a front-of-pack nutrition labelling policy. While the country has some measures in place to manage the interactions between government officials or public health professionals, and the industry, there is still a need to develop robust mechanisms to address undue influence from corporations.

N2  - Bilingual education is one of the most contentious and misunderstood educational programs in the country. It raises significant questions about this country's national identity, the nature of federalism, power, ethnicity, and pedagogy. In Contested Policy Guadalupe San Miguel, Jr., studies the origins, evolution, and consequences of federal bilingual education policy from 1960 to 2001, with particular attention to the activist years after 1978, when bilingual policy was heatedly contested. Traditionally, those in favor of bilingual education are language specialists, Mexican American activists, newly enfranchised civil rights advocates, language minorities, intellectuals, teachers, and students. They are ideologically opposed to the assimilationist philosophy in the schools, to the structural exclusion and institutional discrimination of minority groups, and to limited school reform. On the other hand, the opponents of bilingual education, comprised at different points in time of conservative journalists, politicians, federal bureaucrats, Anglo parent groups, school officials, administrators, and special-interest groups (such as U.S. English), favor assimilationism, the structural exclusion and discrimination of ethnic minorities, and limited school reform. In the 1990s a resurgence of opposition to bilingual education succeeded in repealing bilingual legislation with an English-only piece of legislation. San Miguel deftly provides a history of these clashing groups and how they impacted bilingual educational policy over the years. Rounding out this history is an extensive, annotated bibliography on federal bilingual policy that can be used to enhance further study. © 2004 Guadalupe San Miguel, Jr. All rights reserved.

N2  - This article examines relationships between historical administrative systems and civil service politicization across Europe. I argue that to appreciate when and how history matters, we need to consider public service bargains struck between politicians and senior bureaucrats. Doing so complicates the relationship between historical and current administrative systems: a bureaucratic, as opposed to patrimonial, 18th-century state infrastructure is necessary for the depoliticization of ministerial bureaucracies in present-day Western Europe. However, the relationship does not hold in East-Central Europe since administrative histories are tumultuous and fractured. Combining data from across the European continent, I provide evidence in support of these propositions. Points for practitioners: This article addresses policymakers dealing with reforms of personnel policy regimes at the centre of government. It considers the importance of history for politically attractive reforms, as well as the limits of this importance. I argue that 18th-century state infrastructures shape the extent to which political appointments are politically attractive tools for administrative control. I show that only in countries that feature a bureaucratic, as opposed to patrimonial, 18th-century infrastructure are ministerial top management occupied by a permanent, as opposed to politically appointed, staff. However, in East-Central Europe, a ruptured administrative history ensures that the distant past does not similarly shape the extent of political appointments.

N2  - In looking at the ways in which the relationship between environmental matters and the political developed and changed in West Germany during the long 1970s, this article re-interprets the `ecological revolution' that occurred at that time and rethinks the trajectory of German environmentalism. To get at the politicization of environmental concerns in the 1970s, the article compares two narratives: the `technocratic invention' of environmental politics by government officials, and the career of grassroots anti-nuclear activism. It shows that though these two trends developed in relationship with one another, their protagonists increasingly came to speak past one other. Not only did they begin to understand environmental problems in different ways, they also drew different conclusions about where environmental matters were to be debated, and what ought to be done in order to resolve environmental concerns. By describing these developments and the approaches to environmental politics they brought forth, the article reconceives the ecological revolution as an extended period when conflicting interpretations of environmental affairs underpinned competing approaches to politics as such. While government officials sought to make the environment part of standard political praxis, grassroots activists used environmental concerns as a wedge to push open a wider debate about popular participation within parliamentary democracy. The long confrontation between these two perspectives gave way, during the 1980s, to an environmentalism that was not only level-headed and consensual, but also a seminal concern of German politics.

N2  - Utilising a case study of evidence-based policy (EBP) commissioned by government we explore how academic outputs can serve several purposes, depending on the political milieu and the values and ideologies of any given party. Our commissioned research was being carried out in the context of significant policy change for lone parents in Ireland which saw the introduction of labour market activation. The research was initially used by the then Government to appease the Opposition to the highly emotive policy change. Following a general election, Opposition and advocacy groups called on policymakers to acknowledge the report they had commissioned. Concepts of research(er) deficit, normative reality and a shifting 'policy agora' are explored to highlight how the political context shaped the uptake of the research findings. We followed the debate by drawing on publicly available documentary evidence relevant to the policy of lone parent activation in Ireland from pertinent parliamentary and committee debates involving all stakeholders, that is the Government, civil servants, Opposition and advocacy groups, to ascertain what happened with the research and why did it happen. Attention is given to the consequences of producing outputs that diverge from political values and ideologies, whereby research can be subject to manipulation to discredit and invalidate findings.

N2  - Since Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal and state governments, state officials have sought to offset state expenditures by maximizing federal contributions. One such strategy is to adopt a provider tax, which enables states to collect revenues from providers; those revenues are then used to pay for services rendered to Medicaid recipients, thereby leveraging federal matching dollars without concomitant increases in state expenditures. The number of states adopting a nursing home tax increased from thirteen to thirty-one between 2000 and 2004. This Study seeks to identify the factors that spurred the rapid increase in nursing home provider taxes following implementation of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Results indicate that states with more powerful nursing home lobbies, lower proportions of private pay nursing home residents, worse fiscal health, weaker fiscal capacity, broader Medicaid eligibility, and nursing home Supply restrictions were more likely to adopt. This implies that state officials react rationally to prevailing fiscal and programmatic circumstances when formulating policy under Medicaid and that providers seek relief, in part, from the adverse fiscal consequences of federal policy changes by promoting policy change at the state level.

N2  - Policy scholars have noted that bureaucrats can play an important role in defining policy alternatives. Few studies, however, examine the extent of their involvement in this process. This study contributes to public policy scholarship by offering a framework for understanding the strength of bureaucratic involvement in the process of defining problems and policy alternatives. Using witness data from congressional hearings on crime between 1947 and 1988, I find that federal, state, and local criminal justice bureaucrats have come to occupy a central role in the process of defining policy alternatives. In addition, I find that the centrality of criminal justice actors comes at the expense of interest groups, community organizations, and citizens/victims. Implications for criminal justice policy and understanding bureaucratic involvement in the polciy process are discussed.

N2  - Asia is the most populous and rapidly urbanizing region in the world today and features 23 of the world's 40 biggest metropolitan areas. In many Asian countries, accelerated economic development, industrialization and urbanization have been accompanied by a growing acceptance that decentralization (the devolution of central state powers, responsibilities and resources to the sub-national scale)4 can lead to more effective and responsive governance in state, provincial, city and regency jurisdictions. This trend toward decentralized governance in Asia has often, but not always, been precipitated by a transition away from authoritarian regimes to more democratic forms of governance. Discourses about the desirability of democratic decentralization have typically emphasized the devolution of central state authority as the preferred means by which to empower communities and to increase the voice and participation of ordinary citizens in governmental decision-making processes that affect their lives and livelihoods. Thus, decentralization policies in urbanizing Asia have aimed to encourage the active involvement of urban residents in addressing shared dilemmas concerning issues such as environmental sustainability, public service delivery, community building and socio-political stability in often densely concentrated and ethnically diverse populations. At the same time, however, decentralization within the contexts of globalization and privatization may circumvent critical aspects of democratic procedure if sub-national government officials use their increased access to state power and resources to nurture clientelistic networks of patronage and/or to tap into wider circles of regional or global economic activity at the expense of local urban development. © Pacific Affairs.

It also includes a chapter devoted to the courts’ interactions with interest groups, the media, and general public opinion and a chapter that looks at how American courts and judges interact with other judiciaries around the world. Judicial Politics in the United States balances coverage of judicial processes with discussions of the courts’ interactions with our larger political universe, making it an essential text for students of judicial politics.

N2  - Objectives: This study explores Australian public awareness and attitudes towards political donations from the alcohol industry and the ‘revolving door’ of politicians into industry or lobbyist positions. Methods: Data were collected via a nationwide online panel. Results: In total, n=1,044 participants completed the survey. More than half of the participants agreed that donations are made to influence government policy and to support the interests of the industry. More than half of the participants did not believe that it is appropriate for political parties to accept donations from the alcohol industry or for politicians to attend alcohol industry-hosted events. One-third of the participants agreed that public officials (including politicians) with a role in health policy should never be allowed to work or lobby for the alcohol industry (31.7%) and one-third endorsed a waiting time of 4–5 years. Discussion: There were demographic differences in the views that participants held of the alcohol industry and the relationship between the government and the alcohol industry. The findings suggest that the laws and controls governing industry–government relationships should be reviewed to ensure they are in line with public expectations, accompanied by education programs including a focus on corporate political activity by the alcohol industry.

N2  - Most research into road safety in Europe has focused chiefly on public action, without closely examining the role of car manufacturers or their coordination with public initiatives. This article explores how manufacturers transitioned from a fragmented conception of road safety in the 1970s-with vehicles being the responsibility of manufacturers, and prevention and roads that of institutions-to an increasingly integrated approach in the twenty-first century. The study uses industry archives to present manufacturer strategies from 1972 onward, which at first exclusively focused on vehicle safety standards. After 1986, the European Year of Road Safety, manufacturers' official discourse increasingly stressed user education, as opposed to technical improvements to the product. This article will use the French case, as well as a more European approach to the automobile lobby in Brussels, to chart the gradual emergence of an integrated approach to safety combining the vehicle, infrastructure, and user behavior.

N2  - After an initial phase of firefighting against the euro crisis that began in 2010, one that was characterized by policies that focused on strict austerity, from 2014 onwards the European Commission gradually began to ease its recommendations about fiscal consolidation. Between 2015 and 2016, this policy turn was reflected in series of procedural changes in the European Semester. These gave the Commission a certain degree of discretion in applying the rules and interpreting the benchmarks of the post-crisis EU economic governance arrangements. This article investigates if this double shift in fiscal policy and governance that was initiated in 2014 has been consolidated in 2019, and, if so, what has driven that consolidation. By building on the literatures on EU politicization and policy learning, it asks whether the character of this intra-paradigm policy shift has been more Bayesian or sociological. Based on interviews and on a small-scale survey conducted with key civil servants working at the European Commission, we find evidence to support the putative explanation that, through a political process of policy learning, European Semester officials have acquired a more politicized and flexible practice of fiscal governance and a more social vision of the European Semester. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - In 2014, the largest reform since the US postwar occupation was enacted in Japanese civil service. It was designed as the final step of the two-decade-long effort to restructure the “1955 System,” that is, the politico-administrative system developed under the Liberal Democratic Party’s hegemony. Its purpose was to remold Japan’s independent-minded bureaucrats into the elected officials’ obedient servants. Unfortunately, the reform is unlikely to deliver expected results. The failure’s major reason concerns the fact that Japanese bureaucracy’s unusually large role in policymaking paradoxically discourages elected officials to use their major reining tool against it, namely, appointive power.

N2  - The article is based on the prosopography of people formerly employed by International Departments of the Central Committee of the CPSU, and their recollections of studying at the main school for experts in International Relations -the Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO). The author relies on official biographies and interviews with former employees of International Departments, as well as on memoirs of other MGIMO students in the 1940s and 1950s. Thus the article presents a brief history of MGIMO in the first decade of its existence, but more important, it reconstructs the process of formation of the new post-Stalinist cohort of diplomats and experts that defined Soviet foreign policy. The article discusses the ethos of this cohort (described as ``Hussars' spirit''), their corporatism, their worldview, and the formative influence of their social and educational background. The author argues that the young men born to the families of Soviet white-collar workers, educated in Stalinist high schools, coming mostly from central districts of Moscow, formed a fairly homogeneous group. This group lobbied the interests of their fellow MGIMO graduates in the Soviet establishment of the Khrushchev and especially Brezhnev epochs. They tried to offset the influence of their superiors who belonged to the older generation of bureaucrats formed under Stalin, who hampered the careers of this younger cohort. Less ideologically motivated than their superiors, members of the MGIMO cohort also had fewer illusions about perestroika, and therefore succeeded in assimilating into the post-Soviet Russian diplomacy. They brought with them the traditions of the apparatchiks of the fallen empire, including prejudices and complexes in regard to neighboring states.

N2  - This article argues that since the advent of democracy, the South African Police Service (SAPS) has been plagued by poor administration. Having inherited a repressive police force, the post-apartheid national police commissioners (NPCs) have found it difficult to transform the organisation. Among the unintended consequences has been a rise in police deaths. Although police deaths can be attributed to numerous factors, this article focuses on fault lines in the SAPS administration through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis drawing largely on existing scholarly debates. Essential theoretical perspectives have been employed to gain insight into the root causes of the problem. The article concludes that poor administration and a lack of trust, partnership and collaboration between police officers and community members have perpetuated the killing of police officers. These killings are further compounded by the flawed and ill-conceived selection and appointment of NPCs. As a consequence, the article recommends that the appointment of NPCs should be promptly reviewed. It further recommends that each potential candidate should have risen through the ranks and must fully comprehend the challenges facing the organisation.

N2  - Plan Sésame (PS) is a user fee exemption policy launched in 2006 to provide free access to health services to Senegalese citizens aged 60 and over. Analysis of a large household survey evaluating PS echoes findings of other studies showing that user fee removal can be highly inequitable. 34 semi-structured interviews and 19 focus group discussions with people aged 60 and over were conducted in four regions in Senegal (Dakar, Diourbel, Matam and Tambacounda) over a period of six months during 2012. They were analysed to identify underlying causes of exclusion from/inclusion in PS and triangulated with the household survey. The results point to three steps at which exclusion occurs: (i) not being informed about PS; (ii) not perceiving a need to use health services under PS; and (iii) inability to access health services under PS, despite having the information and perceived need. We identify lay explanations for exclusion at these different steps. Some lay explanations point to social exclusion, defined as unequal power relations. For example, poor access to PS was seen to be caused by corruption, patronage, poverty, lack of social support, internalised discrimination and adverse incorporation. Other lay explanations do not point to social exclusion, for example: poor implementation; inadequate funding; high population demand; incompetent bureaucracy; and PS as a favour or moral obligation to friends or family. Within a critical realist paradigm, we interpret these lay explanations as empirical evidence for the presence of the following hidden underlying causal mechanisms: lacking capabilities; mobilisation of institutional bias; and social closure. However, social constructionist perspectives lead us to critique this paradigm by drawing attention to contested health, wellbeing and corruption discourses. These differences in interpretation lead to subsequent differential policy recommendations. This demonstrates the need for the adoption of a “multi-epistemological” perspective in studies of health inequity and social exclusion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: Advocacy, resources and intersubjective reasonable arguments are known as factors that contribute to smoke-free (SF) adoption and implementation in Chinese and Anglo-Saxon places. Less is known about how the implementation of smoking bans differs across European places. The aim of this qualitative comparative study is to identify and classify the SF policy implementation processes and types undertaken at the local level in seven European cities according to the views of local bureaucrats and sub-national stakeholders. Method: Semi -structured expert interviews (n = 56) with local decision makers and stakeholders were conducted as qualitative part of the comparative SILNE-R project in Belgium (Namur), Finland (Tampere), Germany (Hanover), the Republic of Ireland (Dublin), the Netherlands (Amersfoort), Italy (Latina), and Portugal (Coimbra). Qualitative interviews were analyzed using the framework analysis. Results: Implementation of SF environments predominantly focuses on indoor bans or youth-related settings. Progressive-hungry (Dublin), moderate-rational (Tampere), upper-saturated (Hanover, Amersfoort), and lower saturated (Namur, Coimbra, Latina) implementation types can be distinguished. These four types differ with regards to their engagement in enhancing SF places as well as along their level of perceived tobacco de-normalization and public smoking visibility. In all municipalities SF environments are adopted at national levels, but are differently implemented at the local level due national policy environments, enforcement strategies and the level of collaboration. Major mechanisms to expand SF regulations were found to be scientific evidence, public support, and the child protection frame. However, counter-mechanisms of closure occur if data on declining prevalence and new youth addiction trends trigger low prioritization. Conclusions: This study found four SF implementation types two mechanisms of progressive expansion and defensive closure. Development and enhancement of smoking bans requires a suitable national policy environment and indirect national-level support of self-governed local initiatives. Future SF policies can be enhanced by laws pertaining to places frequented by minors.

N2  - This article examines the largest welfare housing project in the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran (1979-2020). It sets out to present a particular method of research that, borrowing from the discipline of anthropology, takes planning documents as a point of departure. 1 will inquire into the ways state-initiated architectural projects intersect with the demands and realities of domesticity and residents' everyday habits of living giving particular attention to the gender roles and class identities in welfare housing projects and the position of female beneficiaries in relation to their family as well as the larger society. Using the example of the Mehr project in Iran, I demonstrate how housing operated for government officials as a means for re-organizing society along the axes of patronage and patriarchy. Moving to the field of everyday life, however, and building on the discourses of domesticity and women's struggle, I unpack how, starting from the intimate scale of the domestic, welfare can serve as the basis for a newly empowered beneficiary to conceive her rights and exercise them. The research that is presented in this paper challenges the negative conception of welfare housing as mere charitable aid devoid of any potential for supporting the social rights of a people.

N2  - Agricultural public investments in developing countries can have substantial effects on performance in the sector and beyond. In the examination of actual resource allocation decisions by governments and donors, it is striking that strong evidence of the high economic contributions of particular types of public investments seems to coexist with a relative neglect of these public goods provisions in budget portfolios, and vice versa. This article sets out to understand this incongruence, by examining the political economy drivers of public expenditure allocation and composition. It reviews theories and empirical investigations on how (i) the incentives and constraints of key actors-including politicians, bureaucrats, interest groups and donors, (ii) the characteristics of publicly provided goods and services and (iii) country-wide political governance environments affect the prioritisation of public investments.

N2  - In the Russian Federation, owing to permanent crisis phenomena, stagnations and recessions, the toughening of anti-Russian sanctions, the decrease of real income of the major population, the lowering of living standards of Russians, the issues of efficiency of public administration, as well as criteria, by which one should assess this effectiveness, are actively discussed. The concept of ``performance criteria{''} means a set of criteria, based on which the efficiency of a certain system of public administration as a whole, as well as individual administrative decisions, is assessed. The efficiency of the state is ensured by the well-functioning system of state bodies, the ability to articulate and to protect legally the public interest, to implement successfully the state social and economic policy, ensuring not only the interests of the state or the ruling class, but also the entire population, certain social groups and every human being. In this article, the authors attempt to justify theoretically an assessment of the public administration effectiveness through the comparison procedure of the results of certain managerial decisions with criteria features, as well as the degree of achievement of the key objectives when implementing the state policy on the whole and solution of its separate relevant problems. Specific examples, official statistics, comparing them with the developed countries of the world, the authors clearly show the inefficiency of Russian public administration when solving both economic and social problems. The authors make quite a reasonable conclusion that Russia cannot become a prosperous country due to ineffective public administration.

N2  - This article introduces the "communications liaison" (titang guan) - an official category little acknowledged in past scholarship on the late imperial Chinese state. Communications liaisons stationed at garrisons and administrative seats compiled intelligence and news reports for supervising officials in distant locations. In Beijing, capital liaisons compiled documents into court gazettes and supervised the distribution of documents, seals of office, and imperial gifts to the provinces. Besides these responsibilities, capital liaisons acquired reputations for following personal and patronage agendas that undermined the integrity of the bureaucratic state. Longstanding financial and administrative inconsistencies within the Qing bureaucracy induced liaisons to misbehave. Still, characterizations of liaison malfeasance transformed over the course of the dynasty due to institutional developments including the implementation of new communications systems, the standardization of provincial administrations, and the expansion of office sales. Whereas liaisons in the early and mid-Qing periods were parties to political exchanges among the bureaucratic elite, by the dynasty's waning years, liaisons provided services for the larger population of bureaucratic personnel. The liaisons' transformation from spies into postmen, as seen through the eyes of official critics, offers an opportunity to evaluate the impact of major changes in the Qing bureaucracy upon some of its least known officeholders.

N2  - This article traces challenges to Mexicans' legal and racial status by various groups, including federal bureaucrats, nativist organizations, and everyday citizens. Early twentieth-century efforts to make Mexicans ineligible for U.S. citizenship, despite provisions in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, focused on the premise that Mexicans were neither "black" nor "white"; interest groups and politicians both strove instead to categorize Mexicans as "Indian." These efforts intensified after the 1924 Immigration Act and two Supreme Court decisions, Ozawa v. United States (1922) and United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (1923), which declared Japanese and Asian Indians ineligible for citizenship because they were not white. Underlying U.S. efforts to resolve Mexican immigration and citizenship issues was the ongoing problem of determining who could be considered white; this concern clashed with positive Mexican understandings of mestizaje. © 2010 by the Regents of the University of California.

N2  - The aim of this article is to analyse the growth and development of bureaucracy as an institution of government in Bangladesh from historical and politico-administrative perspectives. Although it is now an independent state, various Hindu kings, Muslim emperors, British lords and zamindars of the Indian subcontinent ruled the area of Bangladesh for several hundred years. In 1947, when India and Pakistan emerged as independent states, Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan. To understand the growth and development of bureaucracy in Bangladesh, the article is divided into two broad sections: the colonial legacy of both British India and Pakistan (1601-1971) and the Bangladesh period (1971-2008). The structure and working patterns of bureaucracy in Bangladesh are a legacy of British colonial rule, which impeded reform efforts after Independence and caused politicisation of the administration and governance. Civil-military elitisms reduced accountability of the administration, resulting in a dominating bureaucratic structure with corruption. © 2011 ICSAC.

N2  - Anchored in 19th century scientism and an ideology of the domination of nature, inspired by colonial hydraulic feats, and fuelled by technological improvements in high dam constructions and power generation and transmission, large-scale water resources development has been a defining feature of the 20th century. Whether out of a need to increase food production, raise rural incomes, or strengthen state building and the legitimacy of the state, governments - North and South, East and West - embraced the 'hydraulic mission' and entrusted it to powerful state water bureaucracies (hydrocracies). Engaged in the pursuit of iconic and symbolic projects, the massive damming of river systems, and the expansion of large-scale public irrigation these hydrocracies have long remained out of reach. While they have enormously contributed to actual welfare, including energy and food generation, flood protection and water supply to urban areas, infrastructural development has often become an end in itself, rather than a means to an end, fuelling rent-seeking and symbolising state power. In many places projects have been challenged on the basis of their economic, social or environmental impacts. Water bureaucracies have been challenged internally (within the state bureaucracies or through political changes) and externally (by critiques from civil society and academia, or by reduced funding). They have endeavoured to respond to these challenges by reinventing themselves or deflecting reforms. This paper analyses these transformations, from the emergence of the hydraulic mission and associated water bureaucracies to their adjustment and responses to changing conditions.

N2  - This is the first study of the role Soviet diplomats and representatives of the Communist International (Comintern) played in the Soviet-Tuvan relations during the first decade after the emergence of the young Tuvan state - People's Republic of Tuva (1920s). From representing the interests of a small military mission, the Soviet diplomatic office in Tuva evolved into a full-scale embassy of the Soviet state. Its history clearly falls into two stages: from early 1920s to 1927 Soviet mission members largely abstained from interfering into PRT's internal issues, but subsequently they started actively promoting the left wing of Tuvan People Revolutionary Party, which contributed to its accession to power. The Soviet state began to act as PRT's patron on the international arena. This policy of support and custody was in accordance with Article 2 of PRT's constitution. Using documentary sources, this article traces the appointments and transfers of a number of Soviet diplomatic officers and consuls (F.G. Falsky (Falkovsky), I.A. Chichayev, F.F. Razumov, A.G. Starkov), as well as Comintern representatives (I.G. Safyanov, B. Tsivenzhapov, V. Borovikov, A.M. Amur-Sanan, S.A. Natsov, V.Machavariani, V.A. Bogdanov). In the duopoly of consuls and Comintern representatives, the former dominated at the earlier stages, but after the defeat of Chinese communists in 1927 the Soviet leaders thought that Socialist transformations in Mongolia in Tuva should be sped up. The article makes use of archival sources from the State Archive of the Republic of Tuva, Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI), and the Research archive of Tuva Institute for Humanities and Applied Socioeconomic Studies.

N2  - Power and authority in Russia are traditionally seen to reside with the president. Such an understanding was emphasized during the eight years of Vladimir Putin's presidency, from 2000 to 2008, as he sought to centralize power, strengthen the state and establish a strong vertical of power to implement policy. This article examines the nature of this power and authority in the light of the tandem, the ruling arrangement between current President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin. While acknowledging the central importance of Vladimir Putin in Russian political life, the article argues that emphasis on his role draws too much attention away from the leadership team that he has shaped with Medvedev. This team takes shape in formal institutional structures such as the Security Council, which has become an increasingly important group as a reservoir of experience and authority. It also takes shape in an informal network that stretches across state and business boundaries. Although there are some tensions in the network, this team ensures broad policy continuity. Furthermore, the article questions Putin's success in establishing a vertical of power, and the authority of both President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin. The analysis explores evidence that suggests that, despite the appointment of loyal personnel in this vertical of power, presidential instructions, orders and personnel commands often remain incompletely and tardily carried out or even unfulfilled. In essence, therefore, although many have suggested a split within the leadership, particularly between Medvedev and Putin, the article suggests that the more important splits are horizontal ones between different layers of authority. Thus, a process of direct control is necessary, whereby the most senior officials are obliged personally to oversee the implementation of their instructions. The article concludes by suggesting a reconsideration of our terms of reference for Russian politics, replacing the tandem with the team, and introducing 'manual control'.

N2  - This essay looks at where the line is drawn between political appointees and careerists in the Philippine government and its effects on agency performance. Using the period 1986 to 2010 as a case study, the study unpacks the Philippine civil service to reveal the location and scale of political appointees in the bureaucracy, describes common techniques used by presidents to increase the number and penetration of appointees, and provides a quantitative evaluation of effects. Of specific interest is the thesis from Lewis that while political appointees in the bureaucracy can be a short term strategy for improving performance, the long term consequences are “pernicious” even when appointees are of consistently high quality. The available data permits only the simplest of regressions but results indicate that political appointees may indeed help in the short term but ultimately cause harm in the longer run.

N2  - As markets evolve, new regulatory concerns emerge. In response, policy makers institute new requirements for private businesses. Because they impose costs and generate uncertainty, these requirements may deter firm investment. To reduce regulatory uncertainty and favor investment, a principal can choose a rule-based regulatory framework. However, unlike discretion, rules do not adapt to circumstances and are thus inefficient. Using a micro-founded model, we uncover circumstances under which the ex ante certainty provided by a rule dominates the ex post efficiency provided by delegation to an unbiased agent. We also establish when delegating to a biased agent is optimal for a policy maker. Our main results highlight that the anticipated economic responses of firms can indirectly influence the organization of the bureaucracy. As such, any attempt to evaluate firms' direct influence in the rule-making processthrough lobbying or information disclosureneeds to establish the proper counterfactual that accounts for the indirect effects this article identifies.

N2  - Aiming to analyze the way how recruitment based on the idea of "technical competence", was incorporated in the Brazilian public administration after the 1995 administrative reform, this paper investigates the career of expert in public policies and government management. Among all public administration careers, that of expert in public policies and government management (EPPGM) is an exemplary case, since its creation brings the idea of constituting a stable bureaucracy in face of discontinuities in government, able to prepare and manage public policies in a continued flow, something which justifies studying it. Through various sources related to the career evolution, the profile, and training of these managers, and their distribution in the federal Executive Power, we demonstrate that the very training of these public officials ended up undergoing government interferences according to government guidance and that allocating these EPPGMs to jobs of Superior Management and Advisement (SMA) of the federal Executive has reconciled meritocratic principles with a certain relaxation of appointments, restricting, in theory, the spaces for political patronage.

N2  - The answers come from the results of a survey of biotechnology policy actors administered in the summer of 2006 and in the summer of 2008. Together, the two waves yielded 666 usable questionnaires from interest group representatives, government officials, and independent experts active in Brussels, as well as in France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. Therefore, the survey allows comparisons of actors’ perceptions and attitudes between the EU and member states, but also between Europe and North America. Thanks to data on Canada and the United States, comparisons of member states to non-member states will inform assessments of the extent to which EU policy making practices have transformed democracy at the member state level. © 2012 Michael Howlett and David Laycock; individual chapters, the contributors.

N2  - Through each era, the southeastern United States was and continues to be an epicenter for industrial companies to establish factories and plants. Though this development attracts economic gain for the companies and surrounding areas, low-income and predominantly Black communities bear the brunt of the environmental consequences while frequently remaining stagnant economically. This qualitative, community-based participatory research study grew out of a larger study designed to recruit lay community advisors from communities labeled as hard to reach in research. We focus on Holt, Alabama, an unincorporated community in the southeastern United States region. The primary goal of this research inquiry is to thematically analyze community interviews stemming from a topic of research, practice, and policy interest to community members: the effects of industrial pollution on Holt citizens' daily lives. Content analysis of focus-group transcripts revealed four emergent themes, including: (1) how the pollution affects their water, soil, and air quality; (2) illness related to pollution; (3) community engagement and empowerment; and (4) suggestions regarding what government officials could do to address this area of need. Building upon the prior research regarding environmental justice, human flourishing, and the definition of nurturing environments, suggestions are made regarding the creation, implementation, and maintenance of project advisory councils focused on issues of environmental justice. Community advocacy and empowerment as well as community and scientific partnerships are imperative to alleviate problems associated with environmental justice.

N2  - This article sets out to address what lessons can be learnt from conservation and management efforts across both the natural and cultural heritage environments by highlighting how approaches which separate the two environments are worked into policies and bureaucracies of activities. The authors discuss issues related to the natural and historic environment, the complexities in English legislation, and the organisational structures which make it difficult to work towards an integrated approach which enhances, protects and conserves both the natural and cultural heritage. These complexities are looked at through the 2018 revision of the National Planning Policy Framework, the introduction of the Environment Bill and the Net Gain concept. The authors suggest that working coordination and cooperation across the sectors may result in more effective lobbying and more substantive improvements.

N2  - The issue of this article is the patronage or promotion of de chapels in gothic churches as a mean of consolidation of people's social prestige. All along the XIV century the cathedral and the three parishes of Sta. Maria del Mar, Sta. Maria del Pi and Sant Just in Barcelona had been rebuilt. Church authorities had expected that changuig the romanic churches into the the gothic style known today would be slow and expensive, that is why they decided to confer the new chapels to wealthy people who in turn were supposed to give the eclesiastical institution a generous donation. The promoters of these chapels were mostly merchants and royal civil servants who were at that time in the best social position. Most of them belonged to families who had achieved this position in the past, but we have concentrated in those who were the last ones to obtain better standards of social consideration. The monitoring of their social development has been done thoug legal documentation.

N2  - The Chamber of accounts constitutes one of the essential mechanisms of the ducal government during the second Angevine dynasty in the late Middle Ages. In charge of the control and management of the Angevine legacy, the institution was one of the keys of the establishment and development of princely administration in these territories. The irst «Journal» of the Chamber of accounts in Angers (1397-1424) relects the daily activities of the staff attached to its service. It shows the prerogatives assigned to them, their skills but also their inluence on princely government. However, the administration remained strong during our period. It inluenced the staff organisation and limited their capacity to act. Nevertheless, oficers' careers followed a uniform pattern that brought the institution's members together. Professional identity was notably formed through choices made during recruitment, appointment procedures and promotion within the Chamber. If common characteristics emerge from their status in the Angevine society, an esprit de corps did not emerge from their relations within the institution. The oficers of the Chamber of accounts belonged de facto to the elite of the Angevine administration, although the institution played a part in the success and rise in social status of some individuals.

N2  - The article focuses on a conflict which took place in the Buryat-Mongol Oblast Committee of the RCP(b) leadership in March 1925. This conflict was latent and lasted for eight months. The author of this article has completed the predecessors' findings with extra assumptions based on new information. This includes minutes, abstracts of the minutes and shorthand notes of the party bodies' meetings at the Buryat-Mongol Oblast Committee as well as at the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the RCP(b), along with official statements and private correspondence of senior officials. The article shows that M.M. Sakhyanova's appointment as the Oblast Committee Secretary triggered the conflict. When A.I. Oshirov, a member of a well-to-do Buryat family, was elected into the Oblast Committee in March 1925, it was seen as M.M. Sakhyanova's attempt to strengthen her positions, as then he was her husband. A group of Buryat-born senior officials who were dissatisfied with this decision accused A. I. Oshirov of having a counter-revolutionary background and demanded to expel him from the Committee. However, M.N. Erbanov, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, offered to solve the conflict in a different way - by appointing a new Oblast Committee secretary. The author of this article has identified all the participants of the conflict and found out their main motives. The article shows that the members of the so-called faction, the mere existence of which was against the party norms, rules, and traditions, were initially inclined to use informal tactics of power game. However, after the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the RCP(b) started investigation into this conflict, they had to apply extra methods, such as overt confrontation through speaking out at the Oblast Committee meetings and submission of official statements to the superior party bodies. The Oblast Committee Secretary M.M. Sakhyanova opposing the faction and Russian-born senior officials who supported her acted unlike the faction: openly almost from the very beginning: they brought up questions for discussion at the Oblast Committee and Oblast Control Commission, adopted appropriate resolutions and submitted the case to both the Siberian and Central Control Commissions. The conclusion is that M.M. Sakhyanova managed to retain her political position because she relied on official methods of power game only and had the support of the Central Committee of the RCP(b), which would not tolerate the Oblast Committee Secretary's demotion at the grassroots initiative. The Central Committee and the Central Control Commission approved Sakhyanova's actions and strongly rebuked the faction thus seemingly resolving the conflict. However, M.N. Erbanov, Sakhyanova's main opponent, maintained his position, so the Central Committee of the RCP(b) did not remove the root cause of the conflict to arise again.

N2  - Under the Appointments Clause, the President is empowered to nominate and appoint principal officers of the United States, but only with the advice and consent of the Senate. In addition to this general appointment authority, the Recess Appointments Clause permits the President to make temporary appointments, without Senate approval, during periods in which the Senate is not in session. This book begins with a general legal overview of the Recess Appointments Clause and a discussion of applicable case law that existed prior to the D.C. Circuit's decision in Noel Canning. In Noel Canning v. National Labor Relations Board, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) ruled that President Obama's appointments of three Members to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) were constitutionally invalid. This book focuses on the ramifications that the Noel Canning decision might have on the President's authority to make recess appointment by providing a legal analysis of Noel Canning and the applicable case law that existed prior to that decision. The U.S. Constitution explicitly provides the President with two methods of appointing officers of the United States. This book also provides an overview of the Recess Appointments Clause, exploring its historical application and legal interpretation by the executive branch, the courts, and the Comptroller General. It also reflects on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's decision in Noel Canning v. Nat'l Labor Relations Board, which held that the President's three recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) were invalid.

N2  - Three phenomena that undermine the U.S. administrative state were taken to extremes under President Trump, contributing to democratic backsliding. The first is delegitimization: a suspicion of the public sector that has curdled into claims that public officials are deep state enemies of the people. This undermines belief in the capacity of government to deliver on democratic promises. Second is deconstruction, which includes undermining administrative capacity and delivery of services, making it harder for institutions to deliver on democratic promises, or to do so in ways that are transparent or generative of conditions in which the public sees government helping. The third is political control, in which loyalty to the political leaders is a primary virtue: this weakens structural protections of public employees and the capacities of government agencies to pursue their statutory mission or respond to other sources of democratic control such as Congress.

N2  - All politics and policy issues involve the accumulation of data about problems and solutions in context of social interactions. Drawing on these data, policy actors acquire, translate, and disseminate new information and knowledge toward achieving political endeavors and for revising or strengthening their policy-related beliefs over time. Policy learning' is a concept that refers to this cognitive and social dynamic. Articles in this special issue examine the relationship between policy learning and policy change from different theoretical perspectives. In this introduction to the special issue, we describe the current approaches that structure the field and gaps in knowledge separating policy learning and policy change. We introduce a refined conceptual framework to outline and compare the articles in the issue. These articles point to several facets of the learning phenomenon. First, the articles focus on the nature and consequences of learning by specific groups of society, such as advocacy coalitions, epistemic communities, citizens, street-level bureaucrats, and policy brokers. Second, they present learning processes in which information and experience are used to acquire new knowledge on policy objectives to substantiate and legitimize them or to change or form beliefs. Third, they identify several cognitive and social processes to strengthen the connection between policy learning and policy change. Finally, the articles point to several psychological, social, and institutional factors fostering or impeding these cognitive and social processes. This introduction concludes with avenues for future research.

N2  - In its attempt to prove that voters, politicians, and bureaucrats are motivated by the public interest, Self-Interest and Public Interest in Western Politics overlooks a great deal of public-choice research, to which much has been added during the two decades since it was published. The importance of self-interest at both the micro and macro levels of politics becomes clear once one looks not simply at the "inputs" of a democracy but at its "outputs" as well. The prevalence of interest groups, the dysfunction of the United States tax code, the lobbying by unions for their members' self-interest, the earmarks in the Patriot Act, the numerous cases of corruption in Western democracies, and the dissatisfaction of citizens with their governments' failings all point to the importance of self-interest in politics. © 2011 Copyright Critical Review Foundation.

N2  - This article presents a model of political insulation of bureaucracies. Political influence can harm competence because it lowers the incentives of bureaucrats to invest in competence. Politicians then want to adopt institutions that insulate the bureaucracy because this establishes a commitment to reward competence. Political leaders insulate the bureaucracy if public good provision is important compared to rent extraction or when political competition forces the political elite to internalize the welfare loss caused by patronage. Through this channel political reforms can lead to reforms of the bureaucracy. The theoretical findings are illustrated with existing empirical studies and data on central bank independence.

N2  - How can clientelistic politics be transformed into programmatic politics in a subnational state with a well-recorded history of patronage politics? We explore institutional pathways away from clientelism by systematically explicating clientelistic propensities with programmatic citizen-oriented ones in undivided Andhra Pradesh. This paper engages with a paradigm shift in policy from clientelistic to programmatic service delivery in rural development by exploring three major rural welfare programmes in undivided Andhra Pradesh: need-based redistribution, evolution of self-help groups and implementation of the right to work in India through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme. We argue that the capacity of the state to deliver owes a great deal to bureaucratic puzzling and political powering over developmental ideas. We combine powering and puzzling within the state to argue the case for how these ideas tip after evolving in a path-dependent way. © 2020 Lokniti, Centre For The Study Of Developing Societies.

N2  - Background: The persistence of high maternal mortality and consistent failure in low- and middle-income countries to achieve global targets such as Millennium Development Goal five (MDG 5) is usually explained from epidemiological, interventional and health systems perspectives. The role of policy elites and their interests remains inadequately explored in this debate. This study examined elites and how their interests drove maternal health policies and actions in ways that could explain policy failure for MDG 5 in Uganda. Methods: We conducted a retrospective qualitative study of Uganda's maternal health policies from 2000 to 2015 (MDG period). Thirty key informant interviews and 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with national policymakers, who directly participated in the formulation of Uganda's maternal health policies during the MDG period. We reviewed 9 National Maternal Health Policy documents. Data were analysed inductively using elite theory. Results: Maternal health policies were mainly driven by a small elite group comprised of Senior Ministry of Health (MoH) officials, some members of cabinet and health development partners (HDPs) who wielded more power than other actors. The resulting policies often appeared to be skewed towards elites personal political and economic interests, rather than maternal mortality reduction. For a few, however, interests aligned with reducing maternal mortality. Since complying with the government policy-making processes would have exposed elites personal interests, they mainly drafted policies as service standards and programme documents to bypass the formal policy process. Conclusion: Uganda's maternal health policies were mainly influenced by the elites' personal interests rather than by the goal of reducing maternal mortality. This was enabled by the formal guidance for policy-making which gives elites control over the policy process. Accelerating maternal mortality reduction will require re-engineering the policy process to prevent public officials from infusing policies with their interests, and enable percolation of ideas from the public and frontline.

N2  - The UN often plays a progressive role in challenging oppressive policies and laws globally from a human rights perspective. Since approximately 2005, there has been increased LGBTQI rights recognition within various UN bodies such as: the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Security Council, UN Women and Special Rapporteurs. Despite such achievements, these UN bodies often experience challenges in legitimising such recognition of LGBTQI individuals and communities. This paper critically analyses the effectiveness and relevance of UN bodies in addressing and advocating for progressive and equitable policies related to LGBTQI people through examination of the following: LGBTQI advocacy at the UN; internal bureaucracies of the UN and their affiliates that interfere with LGBTQI rights; and the role of member states. A critical social work lens frames the paper based on a queer liberation perspective, which is inclusive of sexual and gender diversities beyond dominant heterosexual and binaristic constructions (Mule, 2008, 2012). Such perspectives contribute to resisting and challenging norms that make static the identities, recognition and legitimisation of LGBTQI at the UN.

N2  - The potential abuse of power by public officials after they have left government employment became a major issue in Australia with the appointment of two recently retired senior federal ministers to lucrative positions with firms which had close dealings with their former departments. The cases raise important questions about the regulation of ‘the revolving door’ which is an increasing feature of governance as the public and private sectors move more closely together. Australian Commonwealth rules relating to both ministers and public servants are analysed in the context of international practice and as part of the wider issue of conflict of interest. Four types of conflict are relevant to post-employment: ingratiation, profiteering, influence, and switching sides. The regulation of each type is discussed and Australian practice seen to be deficient in certain respects, particularly in relation to ministers. Regulation in this area faces two general challenges: definition of the offence and the comparative absence of oversight and sanctions. But international exemplars offer prospects for strengthening Australia's ethical regime.

N2  - Democracy is not always direct elections; we know their style of Sukarno's Guided Democracy, Liberal Democratic, Socialist Democracy and the Indonesian Democracy in fact now has its own "Pancasila Democracy", where deliberation consensus as the primary basis of decision-making in both the electoral regulations stipulate as well as electoral legislations. Most of the pro elections through the Regional Representatives Council (DPRD) assume Pancasila democracy is reflected in the elections elected by Parliament with the advantage of the state finance saving, avoiding fraud, split nation, black campaign that has been going on so massive and structured. Choosing a Leader in Parliament Election with the media is the best move forwards the implementation of Pancasila Democracy where deliberation and consensus as the primary basis in decision making. While the Election by direct election for this look has been "robbed" of the people because of the massive political legitimacy money, black and political campaigns pitting. Another advantage is more simple and efficient as well as reducing the potential for social conflict, in addition can create patterns of relationships and the DPRD head relatively harmonious. However, a group of pro with the election by parliament also a number of disadvantages election not through representatives, among others, reducing the local democratic process and encourage the strengthening of the political oligarchy and money in Parliament. While some people are pro with direct election assess local elections by the people will reflect a higher level of legitimacy than through Parliament. They assess the local elections by the people reflects the realization of the rights and sovereignty of the people, the people's participation in the elections, and strengthen legitimacy. Some other advantages of direct election, the closer the relationship between the leader and the people, the political education of the people, to institutionalize the process of deepening democracy, and ensure the election of leaders capable and acceptable. Although they admit weakness direct gubernatorial elections by the people, will be the politicization of bureaucracy, high costs, prone to conflict, and the immature state of democratic institutions, in addition to causing problematic in the implementation of the governor's role as a representative of the central government.

N2  - Recent scholarship shows increasing interest in gender, ethnic or national representation within regional and international organizations. In contrast, language as a criterion of representation has rarely been scrutinized. We argue that this constitutes an important oversight for two reasons: (1) language is an important identity marker; and (2) language regimes in international public administrations can uniquely address representativeness relative to both member states and groups of citizens. Our article explores language representation in the Economic Community of West African States, and pursues a twofold objective: first, it extends the applicability of representative bureaucracy theory to the issue of language; and, second, it broadens the scope of representative bureaucracy studies by providing the first study on a prominent West African regional organization. As such, we develop avenues for future research on other regional and international organizations. Points for practitioners The article is of particular relevance for managers in multilingual international and regional organizations. Organizations tend to overlook the role and impact of languages on their functioning, often considering them as a technicality. Taking the example of the Economic Community of West African States, the article argues that linguistic regimes are important for the performance and the legitimacy of the organization in terms of acceptance by both citizens and its member states.

N2  - This article examines stakeholder involvement and influence as part of voluntary environmental agreements between regulatory agencies and companies. Ten pilot projects that were part of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's Project XL (excellence and leadership) were examined to evaluate process goals (fairness and competence) and outcome goals (trust and incorporation of public values in decisions). The ten case studies encompass a range of businesses, locations, and ideas for regulatory "reinvention" projects, and they span a spectrum of stakeholder participation processes and outcomes. Although results point to numerous problems in implementation, they also indicate that in several cases, stakeholder groups significantly affected the final project agreement (FPA) and enforceable permit. The evidence suggests that companies can work collaboratively and constructively with residents of local communities, members of national environmental organizations and other interest groups, and government regulatory officials to craft voluntary environmental agreements that are cooperative and environmentally beneficial.

N2  - A key question in interest group studies is why some interest groups put forward candidates for election rather than simply trying to influence the political process through normal channels. Theoretically interest groups should not seek public office or compete in elections but should rather pursue their goals through frequent interactions with politicians and bureaucrats. The aim of this article is to examine why such interest groups go beyond the informality stage of simply representing their members' interests by interacting with such politicians and civil servants and instead seek election to public office. As political parties in Ireland now compete on an increasingly narrow issue base, this article argues that interest groups involve themselves in elections precisely because they are better able to influence political decision-making from inside Dail Eireann and that election to the Dail is a sign of their arrival as a serious group with a serious cause. This article categorises these groups into those that run candidates for elected office at both local and national level and those that campaign in specific referendums. It also assesses how such groups in effect move their lobbying activities into parliament as distinct from lobbying outside it as is in the theoretical norm in interest group politics. © 2010 Political Studies Association of Ireland.

N2  - These days political advisors are indispensable to state administration. They are appointed to their positions to advise ministers and the prime minister on public policy, various political aspects and coordination, or on public relations and aspects of communication. Their appointments depend on the minister's term of office. Political advisors are not part of the civil service and different states take different approaches, if any at all, to regulating their status. The need for political advisors arises in conjunction with changes in management, the need to strengthen coordination, leadership and strategy, as well as the need to address a growing intensity of communication. Political advisors constitute a new factor in the dynamic between politicians and civil servants, and they bring about changes in the relationship between politics and administration. They generate a mistrust among the general public, due to a lack of transparency and accountability, as well as the fact that, as a rule, their position is governed by specific regulations, if any at all. Conflict of interest, in particular, is a cause for concern. The paper examines the reasons why political advisors may become key members of ministerial cabinets, analyses the concept of the political advisor and their various types and functions, and describes the consequences and key elements of the concept. Trends in some countries are also included.

N2  - In 1965, the Southern Rhodesia colonial state was forced to accede to the demands of an array of economic interests whose enterprises had been severely affected by the continuing droughts in south-western Matabeleland culminating in the devastating drought of 1964–1965. After protracted appeals, the colonial state agreed to establish a water authority, named the Matabeleland Development Council. Why, only then, did the state accede to these economic interests’ demands? It turns out that there had been a whole history of the colonial state’s reluctance to develop a long-term water conservation management regime dating back to the early days of colonial settlement in the 1890s and 1900s. This chapter unravels this story and how narratives about imagined and looming water crises became the basis for the appeals to the state to plan water development on a larger-scale. Since the days of early white settlement in Southern Rhodesia in the 1890s, growing fears of a real/imagined water scarcity crisis and the potential harm it could unleash on the white settler society produced a powerful conviction that every effort should be made to ‘retard the journey of the raindrop to the sea’. These fears engendered intense public calls on the colonial state to take a leading role in the development of large water schemes in order to harness as much water as possible for domestic and industrial purposes. Engineers, civil servants, conservationists, farmers and politicians began to clamor for the creation of a single national water authority (a hydraulic bureaucracy) which would mobilize, regulate and control all the colony’s water resources. Their views entailed most of the elements identified by Molle, Mollinga et al. i.e. the need to implement scientific irrigation, the “‘let the desert bloom’ utopia”, and the ‘biblical/messianic overtone of the call for creating new Edens in deserts or arid places’. This chapter argues that despite various emphases on the plausibility of developing a water authority not only by these classes but also from a series of commissions of enquiry (1930–1953), the colonial state was eventually forced to change course when a devastating drought in 1964–1965 afflicted the already semi-arid region of south-western Matabeleland. It also argues that this drought unraveled the underlying tensions within the central state, and between itself and the various interest groups who agitated for the creation of a structure to control the region’s waters. This study exemplifies how droughts gave a renewed impetus to robust colonial water development initiatives in the post-War era in Southern Rhodesia. Taking a cue from D’Souza’s (2006) scintillating discussion on the making of a ‘colonial hydrology’ in British India, argues that just as the rationale around ‘scientific forestry’, or the politics of land in Zimbabwe Alexander (2006), colonial environmental, economic and political concerns not only defined and impacted the south-west Matabeleland’s ‘fluvial endowments’ in specific and unprecedented ways but that the politics over water development was equally central in the making of the Rhodesian colonial state.

N2  - Encompassing numerous territories across four different continents, Portugal’s early modern empire depended upon a vast and complex bureaucracy, yet colonial power did not reside solely in the centralized state. In a masterful reconceptualization of the functioning of empire, Erik Lars Myrup’s Power and Corruption in the Early Modern Portuguese World argues that beneath the surface of formal government, an intricate web of interpersonal relationships played a key role in binding together the Portuguese empire. Myrup draws on archival research in Portugal, Spain, Brazil, and China to demonstrate how informal networks of power and patronage offered a crucial means of navigating-or circumventing-the serpentine paths of the governmental hierarchy. The decisions of the Overseas Council, which governed Portugal's imperial holdings, reflected not only the merits of the petitions that came before it, but also the personal and institutional affiliations of the petitioner. In far-flung areas such as São Paulo and Macau, where the formal bureaucracy was weak, local cultural and economic factors held as much sway over the agents of the colonial state as did the dictates of the imperial court at Lisbon.Populated by a host of colorful characters, from backland explorers to colonial magistrates, Power and Corruption in the Early Modern Portuguese World demonstrates how informal social connections both magnified and diminished the power of the colonial state. If such systems contributed to corruption and fraud, they also facilitated effective cross-cultural exchange and ensured the survival of empire in times of crisis and decline. Myrup has produced a trul global study that sheds new light on the influence of interpersonal networks on the administration of a vast overseas empire. © 2015 by Louisiana State University Press.

N2  - Purpose The paper aims to investigate how the governance practices of public-sector entities (PSEs) in Tanzania are shaped by competing institutional logics and strategies used to manage the logics. Design/methodology/approach In the paper, empirical evidence was gathered through documentary sources, non-participant observations and in-depth interviews with members of boards of directors (BoDs), chief executive officers (CEOs), internal and external auditors, senior executives and ministry officials. The data were analyzed using thematic and pattern-matching approaches. Findings The paper shows that bureaucratic and market logics co-exist and variations in governance practices within and across categories of PSEs. These are reflected in CEO appointments, multiple roles of CEOs, board member appointments, board composition, multiple board membership, board roles and evaluation of board performance. External audits also foster market logic in governance practices. The two competing logics are managed by actors through selective coupling, compromise, decoupling and compartmentalization. Despite competing logics, the bureaucratic logic remains dominant and is largely responsible for variations between the underlying logics and governance practices. Practical implications The findings suggest that public-sector reforms in emerging economies (EEs) must account for the fact that governance practices in PSEs are shaped by different institutional logics embedded in socioeconomic, political and organizational contexts and their corresponding management strategies. Originality/value Few previous studies explicitly report relationships between institutional logics and the governance practices of PSEs in EEs. The current study is one of few empirical studies to connect competing institutional logics and the associated management strategies, as well as governance practices in EEs in the context of public-sector reforms.

N2  - How should bureaucrats engage effectively and ethically with stakeholders to achieve legitimate policy change ? This essay draws upon findings from a case study of the introduction of an evidence-based rehabilitation program for injured workers with soft-tissue injuries in a workers' compensation jurisdiction in Australia. Despite initial enthusiasm for collaborative policy reform, clinical associations soon withdrew their support. In a classic case of venue-shopping, a coalition of clinical associations formed in opposition to the foundation principles of the proposed policy, overturning the bureaucrats' preferred consultation strategy: a think-tank comprising of invited clinical experts. The policy game turned from highly cooperative to fiercely competitive. These policy upheavals are interpreted through the lens of two theoretical perspectives: Sabatier's Advocacy Coalition framework, and Scharpf's Actor-centred Institutionalism framework. The contrasts in perspectives are melded into propositions for bureaucrats seeking to engage with stakeholders in a contested policy drama.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the challenges and influential factors experienced in the development of public sector accounting reforms in the emerging economy of Sri Lanka. The reforms aim to improve public governance and transparency while reducing corruption and dishonesty. Methodology/approach: Qualitative (thematic) analysis has been employed by using both primary and secondary data. Primary data was obtained by interviewing selected respondents from public sector organisations in Sri Lanka. The respondents were selected by using an expert purposive sampling technique. Apart from the primary data, secondary data such as government reports, relevant literature and paper articles was also analysed in order to produce more robust findings. Findings: The findings indicate that technological and cultural factors have influenced accounting reforms in the public sector in Sri Lanka. In addition, the politicisation and bureaucracy of the public sector as well as sluggish attitudes towards costs have served as prominent barriers to efficient implementation of the reforms. Research limitations: This study was limited in terms of generalisation because of relatively small sample sizes. A larger sample with more diversity could have enhanced the generalisation of the results which could serve as direction for further research. Originality/value: This paper is intended to fill a gap in the existing literature on public sector accounting reforms in the context of less developed or emerging countries. It is hopefully valuable for both policy makers and practitioners by allowing them to view the development, challenges and influential aspects of the implementation of New Public Management (NPM) in Sri Lanka in order that they will be able to make informed decisions about adopting more efficient NPM practices to enhance the country's competitive advantages.

N2  - In the context of the civil service system reform, the new normative framework adopted in 2002 introduced a new management arrangement in public administration, whose consequence was the transition of senior positions within ministries, bodies within ministries, and government offices from political officials to positional civil servants with a limited term of office, who have thus become the most senior civil servants, called administrative managers. Based on extensive empirical research and statistical data, this article provides an in-depth analysis of the status and position of administrative managers, which is intended to serve as a test whether the apex of the Slovenian administrative system is politicized and in what form. In the so-called new democracies, politicization most often is manifested as a violation of the principles of political neutrality characteristic of a professional civil service, through personalized and biased appointments of senior civil servants and in the low degree of protection against lay-offs of civil servants on political grounds. Administrative managers thus often have to decide between political susceptibility and trustworthiness versus professionalism and professional accountability, for their tasks belong to the administrative and political realms. This poses a question about the degree of influence politicians exert on administrative managers and the rate of success with which administrative managers manage to retain their professionalism and independence, which should represent the key characteristics of a senior civil servant.

N2  - Since 1991, India, like many countries, has undergone a process of 'liberalisation' which has entailed an increase in outsourcing of public services through Public Private Partnerships. In December 2012, Chhattisgarh state started the process of outsourcing diagnostics and radiology services in 379 government health facilities. Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (People's Health Movement) Chhattisgarh mounted a (so far) successful campaign against this move. Drawing on secondary data and the personal experiences and observations of the author, this paper documents Jan Swasthya Abhiyan's struggle, describing the strategies that were used, their efficacy, the facilitators and challenges. It uses this experience as a basis to reflectively suggest lessons for health activism and the theoretical implications. Jan Swasthya Abhiyan founded its resistance on a detailed evidence-based critique of the proposal that was disseminated, along with demands. The campaign then used multiple strategies, from petitioning the government, to street action, to advocacy with media and bureaucrats. Alliances were built with trade unions and groups working on social justice issues. Privatisation and neo-liberal policies provided a rallying point and framing the issue as a moral argument and in terms of larger concerns for social justice helped build wider solidarity. This experience suggests that the use of evidence and multiple strategies, effective framing of the issue, forging broader alliances, and a sustained campaign can all be important strategies for health activism. It also highlights the need for health activism to continue beyond a single campaign. Staying vigilant, monitoring, evidence building, mobilizing people and continuing to build alliances on such issues are critical tasks for social movements and networks like the People's Health Movement.

N2  - Politics of ethnicity can have serious repercussions if balance of interests is not maintained and this can lead to internal destabilization of states. This is the case in Myanmar, a situation which has brought suffering and deaths of thousands; effectively raising concerns and opprobrium against the government of Myanmar. Minority groups in Myanmar are greatly oppressed, though recent proceedings have seen the democratically elected government trying to avert the situation, while facing great restraints from the military which has been in control of the government for decades. The transformation process to uphold minority rights is marred with controversy as the Rohingya systematic alienation has persisted even in the new political dispensation. Discriminatory, cumbrous bureaucratic tendencies, are constantly used to control and manipulate the Rohingya to force them out of the country, a system which is ultimately backed by state sponsored violence. This research therefore, seeks to critically examine how the bureaucratic systems in Myanmar has been weaponized to systematically suppress rights of the Rohingya. Most research has focused on the butchering and series of violence against the Rohingya but this is generally a condensed and comprehensive analysis of the direct contribution of the bureaucrats as the implementers of public policy. This research concludes that, the doctrine of sovereignty has largely remained the salvation harboring and facilitating the continuity of repressive regimes despite the existence of the doctrine of limited sovereignty. Most importantly, the Rohingyian ordeal hints on the failures of the United Nations as actions of member states are conditioned by their selfish interests and states would only act where their national interest lie. There is need to create a global authority with executive legislative, judiciary, military and constitutional authority to exert authority over governments.

N2  - Employee engagement is crucial to organizations as it affects the company reputation and employee’s motivation. Leadership is also being considered as a key factor for the success of any organization. In this study, we attempt examine the relationships between qualities of Islamic leadership and employee engagement. Using a correlational study design, 150 government officers took part in the survey. Data was analysed for factor analysis, reliability and validity. The results of the structural equation modelling suggest Islamic leadership style, measured as truthfulness (Siddiq), trustworthiness (Amanah), advocacy (Tabligh) and wisdom (Fathonah) are significance to employee engagement. The findings contribute to the understanding of emphasizing on the role of Islamic leadership approaches in organization. As leadership styles are important but vary, we suggest future research to evaluate the different leadership requirements for various management needs. © 2018, Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association.

Competing demands have grown in the face of perennial water shortages, a situation which has been exacerbated by drought conditions in the past decade. This paper describes the strategy development process recently undertaken in South Khorasan, Iran, in which the inclusion of stakeholder views was central to the approach. It involved government officials and various public and private sector interest groups. Particular efforts were made to involve well irrigators, who are likely to be heavily impacted by changes required to reduce groundwater pumping to a sustainable level.

N2  - This article discusses postretirement appointments and financial rewards the Egyptian military elite secured under former Egyptian president Husni Mubarak. It draws on two original databases: the first analyzes the professional background of the 156 Egyptian governors appointed by Mubarak, and studies the evolution of the military elite's share of governorship positions throughout his years in power The second database includes details on post retirement careers of Egypt's top 65 officers who led the main corps of the armed forces under Mubarak. It analyzes mechanisms used by Mubarak's predecessors to secure the loyalty of the military elite, and shows that increasing the privileges of the top brass remained a stable feature of control systems that were otherwise fundamentally different. It discusses how Mubarak wedded senior officers to his regime throughout his three decades in power by enhancing their material privileges and allowing them to profit from their postretirement positions, unhindered by monitoring agencies.

N2  - The regulation of lobbying activities nowadays represents an internationally recognized standard of good governance. Such measures usually consist of mandatory public registers of lobbyists, meant to increase scrutiny and account-holding over the activities of lobbyists in the political and policy arena. In parallel to public regulation, industry-led initiatives have proliferated in recent years, in the form of private codes of conduct sponsored by professional lobbyists’ associations. However, existing research on lobbying regulation has largely ignored these developments. The article addresses this research gap. It proposes that codes of conduct developed by practitioners’ associations should be assessed through a professional ethics framework and tests this approach in a case study of the European Union (EU). Findings shows that, although the relationship between professionals and the beneficiaries of their services is central to the ethics of any profession, the codes of conduct developed by the EU associations neglect lobbyists’ obligations towards those whose interests they represent. Having been created in response to the threat of public regulation, these private codes sought to reassure the EU institutions of lobbyists’ integrity, leading to a narrow interpretation of ‘ethical’ lobbying as not exercising a corrupting influence over public officials or the public decision-making process.

N2  - This article examines the ethical challenges encountered by European Commission officials in their day-to-day work. Based on an intra-organizational comparison between three Directorate Generals (DGs), the analysis reveals that ethical questions differ in these settings, depending on the type of external actors employees engage with. This internal heterogeneity makes the European Commission an interesting (unusual) case, which highlights the challenges of practising ethics management in a way that is truly responsive to organizational needs. The policy solution implemented by the Commission as a response-the appointment of "ethics correspondents" at DG level-has been only moderately successful.

N2  - Why are politicians and bureaucrats in Jharkhand uninterested in spending central development funds even when the state is so backward? And why are they not apprehensive about what this would do to their electoral fortunes? The Madhu Koda case supplies the answers. The ruling elite relies on a share of the rents or super profits from issuing licences for the state's massive mineral resources. And the vote-gathering system is largely based on kinship and community ties, rather than on interest groups demanding various benefits.

N2  - The federal higher education rulemaking process develops policies that can profoundly affect college students, higher education institutions, and other actors in the higher education policy community. But little has been researched about the influence that different types of actors have on higher education rulemaking. By analyzing interviews with 55 policy and higher education actors as well as reviewing documents, news articles, and websites, this case study examines the involvement and influence of different types of policy actors in higher education rulemaking. This research finds that federal bureaucrats, congressional officials, White House officials, and certain interest groups consistently participate in, and are often influential over the higher education rulemaking process; however, no one category of actor consistently dominates the rulemaking process. Political actors are particularly influential in high-profile rules with easy-to-understand subject matters. In highly technical and less prominent rules, bureaucrats and certain interest groups often exercise greater power. This research illustrates the importance of understanding policy subject matter in determining which actors exercise the most power, and suggests that no single theory of bureaucratic policymaking is consistently correct about the types of actors that tend to control regulatory outcomes.

N2  - As a highly specialized and relatively small sized public service (in terms of staff and budget), diplomacy has always been in a particular position within the administrative system of most countries. Not only does diplomacy attract the pretended ‘elites’ of the public sector’s employees but also a lot of popular criticism with regard to its performances, transparency, dedication to public interest, procedures of recruitment, privileges, and sometimes moral exigencies. This paradoxical ambivalence of ‘elitism’ and public distrust coexists with variable degrees of tension between politicization and the need of effective technocracy. This article explores the concepts, delimitations and functioning of the political-ideological vs. administrative components of diplomatic systems, in the wider context of the administrative paradigms and political cultures to which they belong. While the theoretical distinction between foreign policy and diplomacy is way more developed in European classical approaches, though with controversial results, the American authors and officials traditionally use the two concepts interchangeably. Notwithstanding this theoretical flexibility, the borderline between the political level of diplomatic representation and the professional diplomatic and consular corps is clearer and better regulated in the U.S. system than in most of the European countries. A case study focused on the reform of the Romanian diplomatic service, in the pre- and post-EU accession years, serves as empirical analysis of this demarche.

N2  - In spite of their long history and extensive activities, the international committees of the Nordic Council of Ministers (NCM) have not hitherto been subject to scholarly examination. This article analyses for the first time policy learning among civil servants and experts in this international organization. Using the Advocacy Coalition Framework as the starting point, a number of exploratory hypotheses on policy learning in the NCM committees are tested. The aim is to investigate the processes of policy learning between countries in international committees, a subject which has hitherto only been dealt with in very few studies. In this analysis, a methodology for measuring policy learning is also proposed. Among other things, it is concluded that policy learning in these international committees increases when they avoid fragmentation into coalitions, are open to public opinion, when participants in committees are driven by a sense of purpose rather that material interest, when empirical data are made available to committees, when a neutral presidency is present in order to act as an authoritative persuader, and when neutral experts participate, although not experts from consultancy firms.

N2  - The generic term policy transfer encompasses a host of concepts describing the process of moving policies, programmes, ideas or institutions from one time and space to another. This chapter challenges the short sightedness of the contemporary policy transfer literature and contributes to it an additional Southern perspective. Dolowitz and Marsh list several types of agent that are involved in policy transfer processes: elected officials; political parties; bureaucrats; pressure groups, etc. Rose argues that the key stimulus to spark a search for lessons is political dissatisfaction. Lesson drawing concerns itself with programmes, their development and policy change, in the political arena. Community involvement and partnership working are central to Health Action Zone philosophy. However, although there is some history of local action in most zones, progress in these key areas has been patchy. The chapter highlights an important weakness in current policy transfer activity: its inherent bias towards transfer between developed nations. © Mark Evans 2004.

N2  - This book discusses air pollution in Delhi from scientific, social and entrepreneurial perspectives. Using key debates and interventions on air pollution, it examines the trajectories of environmental politics in the Delhi region, one of the most polluted areas in the world. It highlights the administrative struggles, public advocacy, and entrepreneurial innovations that have built creative new links between science and urban citizenship. The book describes the atmosphere of collaboration that pervades these otherwise disparate spheres in contemporary Delhi. Key features: Presents an original case study on urban environmentalism from the Global South Cuts across science, policy, advocacy and innovation Includes behind-the-scenes discussions, tensions and experimentations in the Indian air pollution space Uses immersive ethnography to study a topical and relevant urban issue As South Asian and Global South cities confront fast-intensifying environmental risks, this study presents a dialogue between urban political ecology (UPE) and science and technology studies on Delhi’s air. The book explores how the governance of air is challenged by scales, jurisdictions, and institutional structures. It also shows how technical experts are bridging disciplinary silos as they engage in advocacy by translating science for public understanding. The book serves as a reminder of the enduring struggles over space, quality of life, and citizenship while pointing to the possibilities for different urban futures being negotiated by variegated agents. The book will interest scholars and researchers of science and technology studies, urban studies, urban geography, environmental studies, environmental politics, governance, public administration, and sociology, especially in the Global South context. It will also be useful to practitioners, policymakers, bureaucrats, government bodies, civil society organisations, and those working on air pollution advocacy. © 2021 Rohit Negi and Prerna Srigyan.

N2  - Over a single term in office, President Donald Trump appointed three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, 54 United States Circuit Court of Appeals judges, and 174 federal District Court judges. Those numbers, particularly the 54 courts of appeals judges, rival those of President Barack Obama’s totals (55) over 8 years in office. However, over that same term, Trump was embroiled in numerous controversies and often frustrated his own administration officials’ efforts to enact and implement policy. Trump’s policy failures stand in stark contrast to his success in reshaping the federal judiciary. This article examines that contradiction and argues that at least part of the reason for his success in nominating federal judges lies in the unique judicial selection strategy he embraced; a strategy for which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Federalist Society members within and outside of the administration were essential players. This article presents one of the first analyses of Trump’s appointment process over his full term in office, including his unique use of appointment short lists, the confirmation strategy his administration pursued in tandem with Republican Senate leadership, and the lasting impact Trump’s appointees are likely to have on U.S. law and policy.

N2  - The goal of this paper is to document and to analyse public administration reform dynamics and outcomes in three selected areas - transparency and accountability, civil service and local self-governments. The high level of potential access to government information in Slovakia does not "produce" increased accountability, predictability and also does not effectively serve as a tool to control corruption. We argue that citizens are not only victims, but also accomplishers: their tolerance for corruption, excessive bureaucracy and rentseeking is confirmed by many existing studies. Concerning civil service reform, Slovakia shows a substantial reform reversal towards politicisation and centralisation after 2001, which clearly threatens the fundamental features of democratic governance. Soon after the EU accession in 2004 major regressive changes took place, and the Civil Service Office was abolished in 2006. The new legislation in force from 2017 (forced by the EU conditionality) should return the Slovak civil service back on the right track - let us to see. With regard to self-government the reforms aimed towards the establishment of more independent local and regional self-government. However, the major issue here is the extreme fragmentation on the municipal level - almost 3,000 municipalities in the country, most of them bellow 1,000 inhabitants. Many studies confirm that amalgamation (or at least functional amalgamation) is necessary - but there is no political will to start it. What are the main lessons from the Slovak case ? The information provided indicates that the Slovak Republic belongs to the "standard" group of CEE countries - after the first wave of democratisation reforms immediately after 1989, most of the later changes were realised "thanks to" external motivations and pressures - and not always really welcomed. The specific issue, however, is the decentralisation reform in 2000 - 2005. This change, providing really fragmented local self-government by extra rights and responsibilities, was internally driven, with positive results from the point of view of self-government principles, but with many hurdles caused by too large a number of too small municipalities.

N2  - A defining characteristic of the Brazilian Congress is the informal self-organization of legislators from different parties into issue-specific caucuses, known as bancadas. Though not official entities and often loosely delineated, these groups many times play central roles in proposing and approving or blocking legislation. Presidents often negotiate directly with the more influential caucuses instead of going through formal political parties. Caucuses can thus have great influence on public policy, both as a locus of lobbying and rent-seeking or as means of representation and governability. In this paper we use network theory to measure the links between legislators using the co-sponsorship of proposed bills. The analysis identifies and ranks the main caucuses and provides a measure of their influence and power. The networks that emerge from these exercises show that, at least at the level of co-sponsorships, caucuses can provide a better description of the legislators’ behavior and interaction than political parties.

N2  - Objective: The Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, third edition (DSM-III), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 1980, included the first official definitions by the APA of tobacco dependence and tobacco withdrawal. Tobacco industry efforts to influence the DSM-III were investigated. Method: Searches of previously secret tobacco industry documents, primarily the University of California San Francisco Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and British American Tobacco collections. Additional information was collected through discussions with editors of DSM-III, and library and general internet searches. Results: The tobacco companies regarded the inclusion of tobacco dependence as a diagnosis in DSM-III as an adverse event. It worked to influence the content of the DSM-III and its impact following publication. These efforts included public statements and private lobbying of DSM-III editors and high ranking APA officers by prominent US psychiatrists with undisclosed ties to the tobacco industry. Following publication of DSM-III, tobacco companies contracted with two US professors of psychiatry to organise a conference and publish a monograph detailing controversies surrounding DSM-III. Conclusions: The tobacco industry and its allies lobbied to narrow the definition of tobacco dependence in serial revisions of DSM-III. Following publication of DSM-III, the industry took steps to try to mitigate its impact. These actions mirror industry tactics to influence medical research and policy in various contexts worldwide. Such tactics slow the spread of a professional and public understanding of smoking and health that otherwise would reduce smoking, smoking induced disease, and tobacco company profits.

N2  - Medicare cost-containment efforts have uniformly led to a reduction in physician reimbursement offset by increasing administrative burdens and costs and complicating delivery of care. Surgeons who face decreasing compensation for Medicare patients may be forced to limit the number of these patients for whom they care. Decreasing physician reimbursement from Medicare typically translates into a similar reduction by private payers. Administrators who come at a cost have yet to show proven value. All of this translates into limiting our ability to care for patients. We are facing a critical moment for potential change prompted by a global health crisis, a new administration, a new legislature, and an increased appreciation for health care delivery among the American public. As physicians, we need to be active participants in changing the system, placing a greater priority on delivering optimal care at optimal cost. We should use this moment when the American public is focused on the need for health care to reprioritize Medicare funding and physician reimbursement while urging reductions of government spending on bureaucracy. This requires actively lobbying lawmakers and speaking collectively.

N2  - Although there is broad consensus on what constitutes procedural due
process in criminal cases, in courtrooms around the country, those
ideals are often disregarded. In the wake of rising public attention to
misdemeanors, be it through marijuana decriminalization or concern over
unduly punitive fees and surcharges, a few scholars have pointed to
theories explaining the gulf between rights and reality for low-level
defendants. Yet none have expressly considered the impact of
administrative rules made (or not made) at the courthouse level. This
Article analogizes the courthouse to an administrative agency and
borrows the doctrine of ``bureaucratic drift{''} to explain how Supreme
Court, legislative, and ethical norms of due process get filtered
through a courthouse bureaucracy that ultimately leaves poor defendants
without access to basic rights. The argument draws on findings of a
five-week court observation project, which documented the daily
injustices-in violation of established law that individuals charged with
low-level crimes experienced as defendants in a New York court. To
remedy the drift, the Article proposes the appointment of an independent
due process ombuds to oversee procedural justice court-wide.

Exclusion criteria: 
- period (colonial empire)
N2  - While there is agreement that the Colonial Office continued to man an expanding empire in the nineteenth century by the technique of patronage, the reasons for the longevity of this practice, despite 'reform' of civil service recruitment in the early 1850s, have been little analysed. This article explores, from patronage records and private papers, the factors sustaining preferment in the gift of secretaries of state and their governors, rather than by resorting to examinations. Its conclusions are that the practice was associated with class status among senior civil servants, gradually mitigated by promotions from within colonial establishments. Patronage was burdensome to manage centrally and had to be devolved to governors, as colonial establishments expanded, creating a pool of talent among senior officials for secretaries of state to draw on. This trend is evident in establishment statistics from the late 1840s to1871. It supports the Colonial Office claim that the service was 'professional' according to its own criteria of learning through experience in political accommodation with local notables and dealing with emergencies. Thus, the department justified its opposition to competitive examinations for appointments overseas, while tolerating them for junior posts at home, and the practice survived till the end of the century and after.

N2  - In the 25 years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, sweeping political, economic, and social changes have profoundly influenced environmental protection in Russia, the world’s largest country and one of global importance with respect to natural resources, biodiversity conservation, wilderness preservation, and climate change mitigation. This paper reviews the state of the environment by assessing post-Soviet era changes to legislation, government regulatory institutions, and civil society. A gulf exists between Russia’s formal environmental laws and state agency capacity and interest in enforcing them. This stems, in part, from repeated bureaucratic reorganizations that have progressively eroded environmental institutions. The Russian environmental movement, which blossomed during Gorbachev’s reforms in the late 1980s, struggled in the 1990s to mobilize the broader public due to economic hardship and political instability. Since then, the Putin administration has labeled many environmental groups “anti-Russian” and used aggressive tactics such as raiding NGO offices, intimidating journalists, and instituting severe legislative measures to quash advocacy and dissent. Post-Soviet environmental successes have been relatively few, with expansion of the protected area system and forest certification notable exceptions. These successes can partially be attributed to efforts by large environmental organizations, but expansion of certification and corporate social responsibility is also tied to Russian business interests dependent on natural resource export to global markets increasingly sensitive to environmental concerns. The paper concludes by illustrating how corruption, poor enforcement, and the muzzling of civil society render the state incapable of resolving arguably its most significant environmental challenge: illegal and unregulated resource use. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Facilitation of connectedness has been a fundamental role of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) and the Public Administration Review (PAR) throughout their six decades of professional service. Together, they have sought to link practitioners and academicians across subfields and varied levels of activities. As a foremost refereed journal, PAR has sought to encourage the linking of practice and theory through timely publication of methodologically disciplined research, informed analyses and commentaries, and constructive literature reviews and correspondence. These responsibilities have been persistently challenging. ASPA and PAR have served a dynamic field that has made some wrong turns and had others forced on it, resulting in failed autonomy, followed by increasing partisan politicization of governments and reduced reliance on professionally expert administration. For ASPA, it has created leadership and membership problems. For PAR, it has sometimes exacerbated difficulties in connecting practitioners and academicians, but it has also created more shared concerns as important subjects of inquiry. Challenges now are to serve both enduring and new spheres of the field that are afforded by international and domestic developments. Both ASPA and PAR are striving to do that. Globalization of public administration opens a world of opportunities today. Localization, as a fundamental of constitutional democracy, is a priority internationally, presenting an engaging paradox of global attention to both place and planet. That is linked in this commentary to the classic democracy-bureaucracy quandary that has constructively challenged public administration. While arrays of other important subjects, old and new, need to command attention in PAR, these are linked in this analysis to today's theory and practice of interdependent facilitative states to assess how the journal serves its responsibilities.

N2  - Cross-border collaboration among domestic regulatory agencies has become a defining feature of contemporary global governance. Substate actors meet with their peers from other jurisdictions to exchange information, coordinate enforcement, and even to harmonize the regulatory rules applied at home (Keohane and Nye 1977; Raustiala 2002; Slaughter 2004). Both the international relations (IR) and international law (IL) literatures have taken note of this form of transgovernmental cooperation, and a term in both literatures has been minted and widely adopted. “Regulatory networks” appear in myriad areas where globalization has affected a regulatory project shared across borders by agencies, industries, and interest groups. In many instances, economic interdependence forges interactions among jurisdictions with distinct domestic rules. The resulting governance frictions produce the impetus for regulatory interactions among domestic authorities delegated with responsibilities for market oversight. There are regulatory networks in antitrust (Whytock2005; Damro 2006), aviation (Bermann 1993), data privacy (Bignami 2005; Newman 2008 a), human rights (Cardenas 2003), national security (Krahmann 2003; Lipson 2005), and telecommunications (Bermann 1995) regulation, just to name a few. In the world of financial regulation alone, which has been a particularly welcoming one for such networks, American regulators have joined the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Participants Group of major export credit agencies, the Financial Action Task Force (which deals with money laundering), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) the semi-private International Accounting Standards Board, and the mostly private World Federation of Exchanges. In addition, the new Financial Stability Board (FSB) is meant to serve as a network of networks, coordinating the harmonization of financial regulation done by other financial regulatory networks and staffed, like them, by domestic agency officials (Singer 2004; Zaring 2005; Baker 2009; Posner 2009; Helleiner 2010; Bach and Newman 2010 a; Brummer 2012).

N2  - International soft law has become a hallmark of global economic governance: networks of official and private ‘governors’ create standards, best practices and norms. Research often frames these efforts as solutions to perceived problems arising from globalization. Yet the narrow focus on the rulemaking process–coordination, distributive implications and implementation–misses second-order political repercussions. Giving special attention to the interaction between international soft law and the political landscape of business advocacy, this article offers an alternative account of the relationship between transnational rules and powerful actors. We argue that transnational informal institutions are not only sites of cooperation that resolve the economic policy concerns of the day, but are also sources of policy feedback that can transform the political landscape. To illustrate the potential empirical traction of these arguments, we examine the critical case of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Institute of International Finance (IIF). The IIF went from being a struggling organization with no regulatory agenda or lobbying skills to the world's most influential financial industry advocate directly engaging transnational forums. We find that second-order effects of soft law were a primary cause of the IIF's transformation. Our study has major implications for research on global governance as we highlight the political ramifications and temporal effects of informal institutions for business representation.

N2  - The states regulate lobbying based on how they define lobbyists and interest groups, by requiring reporting and disclosure of certain activities, and by prohibiting a number of activities between lobbyists and government officials. These laws are designed to provide accountability and to alter certain political behaviors. For decades, scholars have studied these laws, while a number of good government groups have created their own measures assessing lobby regulations. The result is a multitude of measures that often assess very different constructs. This article creates an updated measure of lobbying regulation and compares this measure to previous and current, alternative measures.

N2  - Background: A conflict of interest (CoI) can occur between public duty and private interest, in which a public official's private-capacity interest could improperly influence the performance of their official duties and responsibilities. The most tangible and commonly considered CoI are financial. However, CoI can also arise due to other types of influence including interpersonal relationships, career progression, or ideology. CoI thus exist in academia, business, government and non-governmental organisations. However, public knowledge of CoI is currently limited due to a lack of information. The mechanisms of managing potential conflicts of interest also remain unclear due to a lack of guidelines. We therefore examined the independence of academic experts and how well potential CoI are identified and addressed in four government and non-governmental organisations in the UK responsible for the development of food policy. Methods: Policy analysis. We developed an analytical framework to explore CoI in high-level UK food policy advice, using four case studies. Two government policy-making bodies: Department of Health `Obesity Review Group' (ORG), `Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition' (SACN) and two charities: `Action on Sugar' (AoS), \& `Heart of Mersey' (HoM). Information was obtained from publicly available sources and declarations. We developed a five point ordinal scale based upon the ideology of the Nolan Principles of Public Life. Group members were individually categorised on the ordinal ConScale from ``0{''}, (complete independence from the food and drink industry) to ``4{''}, (employed by the food and drink industry or a representative organisation). Results: CoI involving various industries have long been evident in policy making, academia and clinical practice. Suggested approaches for managing CoI could be categorised as ``deny{''}, ``describe{''}, or ``diminish{''}. Declared CoI were common in the ORG and SACN. 4 out of 28 ORG members were direct industry employees. In SACN 11 out of 17 members declared industry advisory roles or industry research funding. The two charities appeared to have equally strong academic expertise but fewer conflicts. No HoM members declared CoI. 5 out of 21 AoS members declared links with industry, mainly pharmaceutical companies. We were unable to obtain information on conflicts for some individuals. Conclusions: Conflicts of interest are unavoidable but potentially manageable. Government organisations responsible for policy development and implementation must institutionalize an approach to identify (disclose) and manage (mitigate or eliminate) perceived and actual CoI to improve public confidence in government decision-making relevant to food policy.

N2  - Within the publicly-listed corporate sector, forming business groups is a common practice in family businesses in Malaysia. The formation of business groups by controlling families can bring additional agency problems which do not exist in Anglo-Saxon countries, particularly in the US and UK corporations. The expanded control over a number of listed member firms made possible by business groups increases the chances of expropriation of minority shareholders. The more complicated the structure of the business group, the more serious the problem may be. This is especially true in Malaysia where it is widely known that the controlling families of many business groups, particularly the large ones have close relationship with influential senior politicians or government officials. The relationship provides political patronage and protection to facilitate the expropriation activities by the owner-managers. The principal-principal problems can therefore, be more serious. Thus, more understanding of the agency problems facing family-controlled firms can be achieved by examining the business group affiliation issue in some detail. © Medwell Journals, 2014.

N2  - Although lobbying is integral to democratic representation, there are concerns regarding the undue influence of professional lobbyists, which may ultimately lead to corrupt conduct by lobbyists and/or officials. In recent times, there has been an increasing emphasis on legal regulation in order to address the democratic risks of lobbying. This article develops a conceptual framework to evaluate lobbying regulation based on the form of regulation, the standards it imposes, and compliance processes. It explores the history and evolution of lobbying regulation in Australian federal and state jurisdictions. The author identifies three distinct phases of lobbying regulation in Australia: The initial phase of minimalist executive regulation; stronger executive regulation of third party lobbyists; and finally, the rise of legislative regulation of third party lobbyists. It is shown that within the Australian federation, there is evidence of policy transfer across jurisdictions, as well as disparate regulatory innovations in the standards of enforcement and compliance processes. However, lobbying regulation remains narrowly focussed due to the effective advocacy of lobbyists.

N2  - Majority studies on electoral dynamics in Indonesia are reinforce patronage as a pattern of relationships between candidates, winning team, and voters. One of winning team element which have little attention from scholars is bureaucrat. Although, normatively, bureaucrats are required to neutral in all type of general election, but in fact bureaucrats is very involved deeply in general elections. Based on empirical research in Sintang District and Ketapang District, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, we found that bureaucrats have a significant role as a winning team in pilkada (direct election for local leader). Patronage is a keyword to explain political relation between bureaucrats and candidate in pilkada. This situation was triggered by the fact that there are many candidates who have social background as civil servant and, consequently, have direct access to bureaucracy. Bureaucrats have high motivation to participate in pilkada as a broker due to protecting their vested interest. In our cases, the vested interest of bureaucrat is career stability which is promising additional personal revenue and social status. Consequently, staffing (circulation of position) within bureaucracy does not followed by auction mechanism (merit system), but following nepotism mechanism (spoil system). The winner of pilkada is socially pressured to accommodate all bureaucrats who has become their winning team. Finally, we discuss our finding and propose future agenda research to understanding this phenomenon.

N2  - Based on five months’ field research in two districts of Burundi (Bukeye and Mabayi), this case study analyses tax collectors’ rationales and informal practices during their interactions with citizens. The analysis also examines local governance, in order to understand how informal practices are accepted, legitimised and even supported by local authorities. Field observations reveal a fluctuating balance of power, and the various constraints and room for manoeuvre used by local agents dealing with tax payers. Further, an investigation into tax enforcement provides a basis for measuring the discrepancy between, on the one hand, formal good governance norms and standards of behaviour and, on the other, informal strategies developed by local civil servants and officials. The article demonstrates that corruption is mainly a social phenomenon, far from its formal definition, which generally refers only to the search of private gains. Corruption is systemic and part of the current CNDD-FDD party’s governance framework in Burundi, relying on public administration’s politicisation, solidarity networks and socio-economic factors. More broadly, the article shows that corruption labelling remains topical to spur a State conception and structural changes through ‘good governance’ and anti-corruption norms. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Over the past 20 years, states have attempted to develop partnerships with third-sector associations in a variety of policy areas. Advocates argued that these types of partnership would increase the state's capacities to target the needs of niche populations, strengthen associational sectors and democratise state bureaucracies. However, several studies have shown that state-initiated partnerships often fall well short of their desired objectives and often cause more harm than good for the associational sectors of cities. This paper assesses the problems of the associationalist project through France's politique de la ville. The paper suggests that the outcomes of 'associationalism from above' in France have largely been unintended. State officials operating in good faith sought to foster partnerships that would generate benefits for the state and the associational sector. However, as state officials, they were obliged to impose a bureaucratic infrastructure to co-ordinate complex partnerships and ensure a degree of uniformity across France. Associations found that they not only had to conform to new bureaucratic requirements but also they had to respond to an increasingly political funding system. Thus, bureaucratisation triggered the politicisation of the associational sector, compelling associations to professionalise, politicise, and individualise their practices.

N2  - Scholarly interest in the ways in which nonprofit organizations (NPOs) engage in the policy process has increased markedly in recent years, but one arena of participation about which we still know very little is administrative lobbying. To date, no study has investigated the factors that influence the strategic decision by an NPO to focus their advocacy resources on the bureaucracy. This essay models the decision to engage in administrative advocacy by 501(c)(3) organizations as a function of the state-level political environment in which they deliver services and the organizational resources that they possess. Data on advocacy activities and organizational characteristics of family planning NPOs are drawn from tax records and data compiled by the National Center for Charitable Statistics. © The Author(s) 2011.

N2  - Despite the negative rhetoric surrounding the immigration issue, recent policy in many states has provided significant benefits to both legal and undocumented immigrants. Previous scholarship on state-level immigrant policy suggests that differences in the degree of public animosity toward this group may help to explain variation in state policy, but that work largely neglects the influence that industries that employ immigrants may have on state policy decisions. This essay develops the argument that industries that employ immigrants have a substantial impact on policy decisions in some states. It also suggests that the response of state policy makers to public pressure for more restrictive immigrant policy may be moderated by the political and economic importance of those industries. The authors test specific assertions drawn from this argument in an analysis of immigrant policy making in the American states between 2005 and 2007.

N2  - Under forfeiture laws, law enforcement organizations seize billions of dollars a year from U.S. citizens based on demonstrated or suspected connections between the assets and criminal activity. Interest groups have argued that taking of assets through forfeiture intentionally and disproportionately targets communities of color, but scholars have not sufficiently explored this relationship. In order to address this gap, we draw on racial threat theory to develop the expectation that the growth of black and Hispanic populations within a community will correlate positively with the amount of asset forfeiture, and representative bureaucracy theory to develop the hypothesis that greater representation of a particular minority group on the police force will negatively moderate that relationship. We test these hypotheses in an analysis of 2,278 municipal police departments between 1993 and 2007, finding evidence of a significant relationship between minority population share and reported forfeiture revenue. Furthermore, we find that increasing the proportion of black and Hispanic officers negatively moderates that relationship. We believe the results have implications not only for the U.S., but also for other nations with asset forfeiture regimes and more broadly for our understanding of the ways in which law enforcement organizations respond to diverse populations and the moderating impact of representation on those responses.

N2  - Preservationist paraconsistent logicians have demonstrated the utility of k-uncolourable hypergraphs when it comes to formalizing non-trivial but classical inference from inconsistent premise sets. Here it is shown how this application can be extended to the deontically dual political context in which elected officials form unified policies which putatively represent incohesive interest groups. By exploiting the logical duals of k-uncolourable hypergraphs, a non-statistical model for a democratic polling technique is designed whose aim is to preserve electoral representativeness through deliberative legislative processes of policy formation. Moreover, it is proven that the mathematical technology required to instantiate the polling technique exists, and would not be too difficult to implement. In particular, it is shown to be a theorem that For Allk > 1, For Allj > k, There ExistsH : H is a hypergraph with chi(H) = k + 1, and For AllE is an element of H, the restriction of H to boolean ORH - E has chromatic number k - 1.

N2  - New York's state trial courts accept more than four million new case filings every year.1 This substantial caseload makes it one of the busiest court systems in the nation. Cases range in importance from petty misdemeanors and small claims actions in village justice courts to appellate cases having vast implications for economic and social life in the state. Despite the political significance of many of these judicial decisions, courts and judges are frequently omitted from discussions of the state's political system; indeed, courts are often seen as apolitical, with judges' decisions considered to flow from legal standards that are nondiscretionary and somehow above politics. Yet courts are incontrovertibly an essential component of any political system. Furthermore, American courts are undeniably political in at least three additional senses. First, courts make decisions that can have dramatic impact on the allocation of power and resources in society-the essence of politics. For example, New York courts regularly resolve election disputes and, in so doing, have a substantial impact on who governs;2 they have assessed everything from the winner of the America's Cup yachting race in 1990, to the legality of hospitals' plans to destroy frozen human embryos, the constitutionality of the "Son of Sam" law that prevents convicted criminals from profiting from their illegal acts through book and movie contracts, and the legal adequacy of the state's elementary and secondary public school funding system. Even when courts resolve private disputes over personal injuries or contractual obligations, they set down legal standards that guide the vast system of individual and business behavior, with enormous social, economic, and political implications. Second, judges have considerable discretion in reaching many of their most important decisions. Judicial rulings might be of limited interest to students of politics if the decisions themselves were dictated by an autonomous, value-free entity called "The Law." Political scientists and legal scholars have long regarded this characterization of legal decision making, at least in American courts, as inadequate. Decisions of judges must be justified in legal terms, to be sure. And some provisions of statutes or constitutions are very clear and specific, leaving little room for judicial interpretation. But many legal enactments, from city ordinances to state constitutions, are deliberately vague, inviting judges to inject their own political values into the process of legal interpretation. For example, state courts have had to determine whether the constitutional protection of freedom of speech in the New York State Constitution is violated by a ban on political solicitation in privately owned shopping malls and to what extent do public employees have free speech protections in the workplace; whether a long-term same-sex relationship constitutes a "family" within the meaning of New York City rent-control regulations; and whether the constitutional prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures is violated by police seizure of a gun in plain view during a routine stop of a vehicle for a traffic infraction, or by a school official's search of a student bookbag or locker. The words of ordinances, statutes, or constitutions may seem clear enough in the abstract, but when judges must apply those general words to the ambiguities of real-life situations such as those described above, they have considerable leeway in interpretation. In such circumstances, judges are necessarily exercising discretion and making policy.3 Finally, American courts at all levels are intimately connected to the political system through the ways in which judges and other court officials are selected. As will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter, most New York State judges are popularly elected; those that are not elected are appointed by the governor or by city mayors. Virtually all New York's elected judges are nominated by local political parties, through a highly political process that frequently rewards the party faithful with judicial nominations. Similarly, politics is seldom very far in the background when judges are selected by governors and mayors, even when, as is the case with the state's highest judges, they must be first nominated by a nonpartisan4 selection committee. Political considerations also pervade appointment of other courtsystem officials, from selection of judges to serve on the appellate division of the supreme court,5 to the administrative judges who supervise the state's judicial districts, administrative officials in the court system and the law clerks, assistants, and the legally trained "secretaries" who serve with trial court and appellate judges throughout the state. This chapter first summarizes the organization of New York's state court system. This is not a simple task, for the court system has an arcane, highly complicated structure. The next section sets out how the court system is governed and administered. We then discuss three perennial political and reform issues regarding court reform in New York: proposals for simplification of the state's court structure and staffing, creation of a new geographical department to handle growing caseloads, and altering the system of judicial selection.

N2  - Principal-agent models of corruption control that emphasize rules,
incentives, and sanctions as prime antecedents of corruption often stop
short when evaluating how these general principles translate into
concrete Human Resource Management (HRM) policies. Following a call to
develop research about how day-to-day public management operations
change incentives to be corrupt, we use data of 5.22 million USD audited
to 545 local Mexican governments over 3 years to test the correlation
between the misappropriation of public funds and specific HRM functions.
Our results suggest that HRM is a critical, underseen factor in
understanding the risk of corruption. In line with previous findings, we
show that having merit-based recruitment can prevent corruption.
However, we also find that having performance and departmental
evaluations and a less unequal structure of remunerations may also help
local governments effectively avoid the misappropriation of public
money.

N2  - Mexico is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of obesity and recently declared a national epidemic of diabetes. Healthy food environments have the potential to improve the diet of the population and decrease the burden of disease. The aim of the study was to assess the efforts of the Mexican Government towards creating healthier food environments using the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI). The tool was developed by the International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS). Then, it was adapted to the Latin-American context and assessed the components of policy and infrastructure support. Actors from academia, civil society, government, and food industry assessed the level of implementation of food policies compared with international best practices. Actors were classified as (1) independents from academia and civil society (n = 36), (2) government (n = 28), and (3) industry (n = 6). The indicators with the highest percentage of implementation were those related to monitoring and intelligence. Those related to food retail were rated lowest. When stratified by type of actor, the government officials rated several indicators at a higher percentage of implementation compared with independent actors. None of the indicators were rated at high implementation. Government officials and independent actors agreed upon nine priority actions to improve the food environment in Mexico. These actions have the potential to improve government commitment and advocacy efforts to create healthier food environments.

N2  - How are civil servants and politically appointed advisers likely to respond to policy proposals that they believe will harm their countries severely even if they are legal? Based on the different loyalties and roles of political advisors (PA) and civil servants (CS), we hypothesise that (1) PAs are more likely to voice internally, (2) CSs are more likely to voice externally and (3) CSs in functionally politicised systems are more likely to stay silent. These hypotheses are tested on - and partially supported by - data collected through two surveys directed to the ministerial staffs in Denmark and Sweden. PAs are more likely to voice internally, but none of the two groups is particularly keen to voice externally. The propensity to voice concerns in case of perceived harmful policy proposals depends on the kind as well as the level of politicisation.

N2  - The use of recommendations for the selection of prefects began in 1430 and reached its height in the Zhengtong reign (1435-1449). Government leaders also used recommendations to appoint county magistrates, censors, and capital officials, but prefects were the local officials most consistently appointed this way. Organizers of political cliques later used recommendations to patronize their supporters. By the late fifteenth century abuse of recommendations made many officials prefer to seek appointment through regular bureaucratic procedures. Disuse finally led to the effective end of recommendations for the appointment of prefects by the early sixteenth century. The article explores the various reasons why the procedure was adopted in the first place, and examines the many changes to which it was subjected until its eventual abandonment.

N2  - Prior to the introduction of Western political thoughts on local governance to China in the 19th century, for centuries Chinese intellectuals had also been engaging in extensive debates on the advantages and disadvantages of various forms of local governance. The debate was at first centering on whether feudalism is a better system than a centralized bureaucracy. Then, during the Song and Yuan Dynasties, scholars began to question whether either system was superior to the other. They argued that optimal institutional choice might depend on the particular circumstances. During the Ming Dynasty, Gu Yanwu proposed an alternative system named “embodying feudalism in centralized bureaucracy,” wherein county magistrates are selected and evaluated by the local constituents. To be reappointed, the incumbent magistrate must perform well. After each successful reappointment, the magistrate will be vested more power in personnel appointment and budgeting. After three successful terms, the incumbent magistrate will be granted tenure of his position. The system of “embodying feudalism in centralized bureaucracy” proposed by Gu Yanwu is in nature a form of local self-government, a path breaking institutional renovation in Chinese history…

N2  - Kakei Katsuhiko is well-known for his advocacy of a unique Shinto philosophy and had a considerable influence on colonial government officials, Shinto shrine administrators and agricultural emigration leaders. In spite of his substantial influence, there have been no specific researches on the effect he had on Japanese colonies. The present study aims to review and analyze Kakei’s activities in Japanese colonies with special focus on those in Manchuria. In the first section, Kakei’s fundamental stance on the colonies is reviewed with reference to his visit to the Korean Peninsula. In the second section, Kakei’s hierarchical theory of the colonies is examined using a lecture he gave in Taiwan. The third and fourth chapters deal with the roles Kakei actually played in Manchuria, on which he left a major mark. Finally, I look at the reasons why Kakei was admired by the elite class in the colonies who has been sent out from the Japanese mainland. Kakei is said to be a person who did not discriminate between the colonies and mainland Japan, but his view was clearly rooted in the then-prevailing idea of “a superior Japan and inferior colonies”; thus, for Kakei, people in the colonies had to be cultivated. He attempted to establish a hierarchy between Japan and its colonies in the name and to the glory of the Emperor. In order to learn how Kakei responded to actual issues in the colonies, I look at his activities in Manchuria. Kakei served the Kenkoku Daigaku (National Foundation University) in Manchuria as a founding committee member. He also delivered lectures in the presence of the Puyi, the Emperor of Manchukuo. From his point of view, Manchurian culture was superior to that of Korea but inferior to that of Taiwan. He also believed emigrants from the Japanese mainland should play an important role in conveying Japanese spirit to Manchuria. However, he failed to produce the results expected of him in Manchukuo. Although he was a founding member of the Kenkoku Daigaku, his ideas were ultimately rejected by Japanese government officials in Manchukuo. Also, his lectures in the presence of Puyi were totally unacceptable to the Manchurians as Kakei outspokenly defined Manchukuo as a subordinate country under the rule of the Japanese Emperor. The paper concludes that Kakei did not actually have much influence on realities in Japan’s colonies. Nonetheless, Kakei was admired for his solid and unwavering stance by elite officials sent from the mainland. Kakei consistently asserted that Japanese ancient Shinto (Ko-Shinto, centered on the philosophy of “kan nagara no michi”) is a religion that leads all living beings to shine under the glory of the Emperor and that the empire could only be united when all its people believed in Shinto. His view of the people in the colonies being spiritually and economically inferior to people on the Japanese mainland led him to advocate that Japanese emigrants should beco role models for the local people. Kakei’s chief contribution to the colonies appears to have been the establishment of an intellectual framework for self-justification of the emigration of an elite class from the Japanese mainland. Such an “inward-looking” intellectual framework helped forge an identity only valid in Japanese communities themselves, but unacceptable elsewhere. © 2016, International Research Center for Japanese Studies.

cited By 4
N2  - This article provides insight into regeneration of nomenclature as the
ruling social stratum of post-Soviet Russia after the revolutionary
events of 1990. This type of political establishment is not a state
bureaucracy or a meritocratic elite, but a social phenomenon generated
and ontologically inherent in the Soviet political regimes.
The process of regeneration of nomenclature started when the
representatives of the Soviet nomenclature filled the structures of the
new Russian government. ``Privatization in the Russian style{''}
contributed to the process and led to the formation of
nomenclature-oligarchic clans. These clans and their struggle for power
and resources form the basis of the vital activity of the Russian
nomenklatura.
During the second term of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, the process of
``buying up the state{''} by nomenclature-oligarchic clans and
incorporation of their representatives and lobbyists into executive and
legislative power structures significantly intensified. Operation
``successor,{''} which brought Vladimir Putin to power in 2000,
finalized the formation of the nomenklatura-oligarchic regime as the
ruling regime in post-Soviet Russia and Russian nomenklatura as the
dominant social stratum.

N2  - Lobbying appears and develops as an essential component of the relation between decision-makers and interest groups - it is an expression of the citizens' fundamental right to express and group themselves for achieving common goals. In our context, the goal is influencing legislation by the stakeholders. Today, EU lobbying, which is extremely active, is more and more structured, institutionalized and regulated. Politicians, public officials need legitimacy, expertise, partnerships and coalitions, assistance for implementing public policies, whereas interest groups themselves need access to information about the newly proposed public policies as well as access to decision-makers for providing them with expertise aiming to influence political decisions. In the present article, the author proposes an analysis of the EU policy making given the fact that the dialogues and partnerships established between decision-makers and different interest groups are essential for leading to a mature, responsible and efficient decision-making process.

N2  - A consideration of rulemaking petitions to the Federal Communication Commission takes advantage of a highly formalized process to help systematically examine the influence that regulated parties have on agenda formation. Since the 1960s, submissions of petitions for rulemaking to the FCC have generated an increasingly large share of the agency's entire rulemaking agenda, and success for petitions is clearly greater for powerful organized interests. But an analysis of the 237 petitions for rulemaking at the FCC demonstrates that powerful interests are limited in their ability to control the agency's agenda. For example, efforts to divert the agency's attention by submitting comments opposing petitions are, at best, inconsequential and may be counterproductive. In addition, the most powerful organized interests who submit petitions for rulemaking at the FCC experience less success when confronting a more liberal commission majority.

N2  - Motivation Little is known about how partnerships between the state and civil society organizations (CSOs) to deliver services as part of counter-terrorism measures (CTMs) work in practice; nor how CSOs make sense of such partnerships and their implications. Purpose This article examines patterns in partnerships between the state and CSOs to deliver services. It investigates how CSOs perceive this partnership and the socio-political and policy implications. Approach and Methods Faith-based, youth/children CSOs, women's and human rights groups engaged in capacity building, technical assistance and advocacy in counter-terrorism operations in northeast Nigeria were studied. A mixed-method design was adopted to examine the experiences and perspectives of CSO managers and field staff, as well as the views of government officials, including security agents involved in counter-terrorism. Findings The state contracted the CSOs to deliver services, but not to engage in political advocacy. Thus, the state controlled the political realm and influenced the non-political arena. CSOs believed that the service-delivery partnership impinged on their organizational principles and capacity to demand government accountability and transparency. Policy implications CSOs should be engaged as vital and equal partners in addressing security issues. Excluding advocacy-oriented CSOs from security measures is counter-productive. It potentially silences public demands for transparency, accountability and justice, thereby entrenching insecurity and impinging on humanitarian interventions. Restricting CSOs to service delivery undercuts their ability to connect government and society.

N2  - The judiciary is commonly regarded as the gatekeeper of democracy and constitutionalism. In Malawi, the work of the judiciary must be appreciated closely with the powers and functions of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). While precise connections have yet to be fully unravelled, it is clear that the JSC or any other body, however named, that manages appointments and discipline of judges, can influence the quality of a judiciary. By focussing on the JSC, the article demonstrates that the JSC has remained dormant, especially in terms of elaborating on the framework governing its operations. The article focuses specifically on the composition and legal status of the JSC; the record of the JSC in maintaining discipline among judicial officers; the accountability of the JSC in its operations and the role of the JSC in the appointment of judges and the maintenance of judicial independence. It is the article's conclusion that these aspects of the work of the JSC are in dire need of reform. Building on a comparative expose, the article recommends that legislation should be adopted to clarify the duties and operations of the JSC; that there should be enhanced transparency and accountability in the operations of the JSC; that greater administrative support be rendered to the JSC; and that the composition of the JSC be altered to increase its size and diversity.

N2  - In 2009, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) decisively defeated the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), ending more than half a century of one-party dominance, and raising hopes that Japan could finally reverse two decades of economic stagnation and recapture at least some of the dynamism that brought it fame in the 1950s and 1960s. The five guiding principles of the DPJ’s “manifesto” or electoral platform proclaimed the party’s determination to exercise responsible political leadership to overcome the entrenched resistance of bureaucrats and interest groups and improve the livelihood of the Japanese people (Democratic Party of Japan 2009: 4). Did the Japanese policymaking system really lack political leadership, or was this just electoral sloganeering? And was Japanese policy actually hostage to bureaucrats and interest groups? Informed observers offer diverging judgments. In one view, a system that once served Japan well became increasingly dysfunctional in the 1990s as the political and economic environment grew more complex and uncertain, not least because of a temporary weakening in LDP rule (Amyx 2004). From another perspective, the chronic inefficiency of the politically protected domestic sector eventually became too much even for Japan’s famously competitive and efficient exporters to overcome (Katz 1998). Still other analysts insisted that the policymaking system was always highly problematic (Emmott 1989). The common theme, understandably enough, is the continuity of Japanese policy. This chapter takes a somewhat different angle on the problem. While policymaking often lagged behind changes in the economic, political and social environment, and Japan never implemented the kind of social democratic policies seen in northern Europe, the content of Japanese policy changed markedly over the years. In contrast, the policymaking system was indeed remarkably stable-or stagnant-after the Second World War, and particularly from the early 1960s until 2001. Only the victory of the DPJ in 2009 brought a fundamentally different conception of the relationship among the major participants in the policymaking system: bureaucrats, interest groups, academics and experts, and above all Diet members and their party leaders.

N2  - Many scholars contend that senators defer to the president on appointments to executive branch positions. Others assert that presidential appointments are highly constained by senatorial 'folkways'. Still others argue that the bureaucracy is essentially uncontrollable via political appointments. In this paper, we present a stylized spatial model of presidential appointments and agency policy-making to explicate the conditions under which senators will constrain presidential appointments to indepedent agency boards. A ke parameter for determining presidential influence is the direction (or absence) of policy drift induced by career bureaucrats' policy preferences. We show that presidential capture of independent agencies follows from favorable bureaucratic drift, but typically does not arise under adverse or zero drift. We illustrate the model via a simulation of appointments over time to an idealized agency board, identifiying conditions under which rapid policy convergence on presidential preferences is possible.

N2  - Policy instruments are linked to the development of new modes of governance. They provide cognitive and normative frameworks for policy-makers to advocate changes, to implement new programmes, and to create new types of public interventions (Lascoumes and Le Galès 2007). They contribute to the transformation of the State through the invention of new tools and devices, particularly metrics, which give legitimation to political aims, values, and ideologies. It corresponds to New Public Management which pretends reinventing tools of government and overcoming bureaucracy sometimes by reusing recipes from the past (Hood 1986). The instruments participate also in a kind of depoliticization and re-politicization of decision-making whereas policy-makers face many contestations and oppositions from different interest groups. As Michel Foucault demonstrated, these technical procedures of power and instrumentation are central to the art of governing and the development of a rationalizing State (Foucault 1977). Governmentality is not only based on measuring devices but also on intellectual and scientific technics, ways of thinking, epistemologies which become operational through metrics (Miller and Rose 2008). New relationships are established between science, expertise and politics that impact on the ownership, selectivity and choices of tools and instruments.

N2  - The traditional portrait of the administrative state often features the politically-appointed agency head at its center:{''} the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, or the Secretary of the Department of Labor. This picture of bureaucratic power, however, is incomplete. For much of that power is, in fact, subdelegated within the agency. The implication is that decision rights are often exercised not by statutory delegates, but rather by lower-level officials and tenure-protected career staff. The purpose of this work is to bring these background actors like the Securities and Exchange Commission's Director of Enforcement squarely to the foreground. In doing so, this Essay develops a positive theory for how and why agency heads subdelegate their power and analyzes the resulting normative implications. The analysis draws on a rich social science literature to argue that delegations within agencies are best understood as credible commitment devices through which agency heads motivate better-informed but potentially biased subordinates. This decision to commit, however, is itself subject to the internal transaction costs of reviewing subordinate recommendations. These dynamics, in turn, suggest a role for courts to maximize high-quality information within agencies by taking credibility into account in their appointments and removal jurisprudence; deferring to subdelegations promulgated through transparent, deliberative procedures; and providing clearer ex ante guidance as to when internal subdelegations will be judicially enforced. At the same time, political actors (not courts) should police the counter-vailing concern that subdelegation can also be used as a tool of partisan entrenchment.

N2  - With pressures stemming from the increasing dissatisfaction with the democratic deficit, the European Union (EU) has taken different measures for getting closer to its citizens. One such measure is the European Commission’s funding of interest groups, which consequently encourages their formal and informal participation in EU policymaking. In this way, the EU also supports interest groups in their generating of expertise and giving valuable information to EU officials who are preparing legislation. In this article we analyse the main characteristics of national interest groups from selected Central and Eastern European post-socialist countries that receive EU money and at the same time are supposed to be supported with EU money vis-à-vis Western EU member-states to a lesser extent. The analysis is based on the data collected in frame of Comparative Interest Groups Survey project with a web survey that was conducted among national interest groups from Slovenia, Lithuania and Poland. The research results show that although EU funds are less important sources of funding than other sources, they have a substantial effect on interest groups in Central and Eastern Europe. Interest groups that receive EU funding have bigger budgets, better access to national and EU decision-makers and are more likely to lobby.

N2  - The Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) posits that policy actors, including elected officials and bureaucrats, aggregate into coalitions based on shared beliefs and coordinate to achieve policy objectives. Yet, bureaucrats are often subject to political control mechanisms understood within a principal-agent framework. Combining insights from principal-agent theory and the ACF, we explore the nature of principal-agent relationships within and across advocacy coalitions in the United States using case studies of nuclear waste management and fair housing policy. Specifically, we develop three propositions regarding principals and agents as members of advocacy coalitions and examine those propositions by comparing the two case studies. We find that powerful elected officials and expert bureaucrats are important resources for coalitions; bureaucrats are in coalitions but face cross-pressure from principals in opposing coalitions; and control mechanisms embedded in policy designs by principals can limit bureaucratic discretion in a way that aligns with coalition goals.

N2  - Popular attitudes towards crime in Latin America induce local legislators to support harsh sentencing frameworks. What, therefore, explains the adoption of non-prison sentences across the region? Using Brazil as a case study, this article claims that sentencing reform is a consequence of the growing autonomy of bureaucrats who manage the criminal justice system. Insulated from patronage networks and granted broad mandates to pursue solutions to pressing penal crises, these policy elites use their position in the state to develop new rules and facilitate their approval despite popular opposition to measures that limit the state's punitive capacity. The findings point to the importance of bureaucratic autonomy for the enactment of policies that can benefit the underprivileged but do not enjoy widespread support from voters.

N2  - Using a qualitative research approach, this study provides an inquiry into the nature of democracy and digital political activism discourses on @Hopewell Chin’ono and @Jacob Ngarivhume prior to the 31st July demonstrations. Alternative communications spaces have revolutionised political communication in Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe, political polarisation has created a monolithic voice in the mainstream media. In the “Second Republic”, digital activism is a growing phenomenon where subalterns question the state. This study is guided by Manuel Castells’ Power and Counter Power Theory. Data gathered using netnography was analysed using critical discourse analysis. Findings show that digital activism has turned into social media “dissidence”, calling for the resignation of the government officials including the Executive through 31st demonstrations. There is an intimate relationship between digital democracy and digital activism, enabling political advocacy and lobbying. Twitter is used to safeguard the lives of activists. Religious discourses were used by both Jacob Ngarivhume and Hopewell Chin’ono as they drummed up support for the July 31st demonstrations. © 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - Solid waste management (SWM) in many low- and middle-income countries is sometimes driven by the informal sector. Unfortunately, contributions of the sector to SWM are not acknowledged in many developing countries. This situation often arises from inadequate awareness and lack of advocacy for these development contributions. This article reports on the impact of a study conducted by final-year geography undergraduates on the informal waste management sector in Nsukka urban area, Nigeria. The purposes of this exercise were to stimulate development intervention on behalf of the sector to improve perceptions, attitudes and performance, to impart a range of development research skills and to expose the students to the business opportunities provided by SWM and recycling. Informal waste sector workers and government officials responsible for SWM were interviewed, and some commercial data on recycling operations were collected. Findings of this study indicate that such advocacy initiatives were effective in increasing students' awareness of opportunities and interest in working in the informal waste sector to promote better SWM and development in Nigeria. Lessons from this university case study are also drawn for other developing countries struggling to achieve the poverty reduction and job creation Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

N2  - Temporal leaders in federal agencies-commonly known as ``actings{''}- are a fixture of the modern administrative state. These acting officials have recently come under fire, particularly after President Trump ousted Jeff Sessions and installed Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney General in November 2018. Yet despite their ubiquity and the fervent criticism we know almost nothing about them. This Article examines open questions about acting officials through empirical, legal, and normative frameworks. Empirically, it provides new data on acting department heads from the Reagan Administration through President Trump's third year. The data show that President Trump has turned to significantly more acting cabinet secretaries than prior Presidents. Using two agencies as case studies, this Article also examines acting officials outside the cabinet and discovers similar trends. But the data also reveal that previous administrations relied considerably on temporary leaders, particularly at the start and end of presidential terms. These empirical findings inform the analyses of a slew of tricky constitutional and statutory questions. This Article addresses open constitutional questions about who can serve in the federal government's highest positions and for how long. It also examines undecided statutory issues, such as how the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (Vacancies Act) interacts with agency-specific statutes, whether the Vacancies Act covers vacancies created by firings, and whether a ``first assistant{''} can be named after the vacancy and then serve in an acting role. Finally, this Article highlights two thorny areas that have both constitutional and statutory components-the delegation of authority to lower-level agency officials and the applicability of removal restrictions to acting heads at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The new data raise additional questions about the conventional criticisms of acting officials as ``substitute teachers,{''} or worse, ``workarounds, `` to the Senate confirmation process. This Article examines these criticisms and suggests that, while the concerns have some merit, acting officials provide needed expertise and stability-in some contexts, the Senate may prefer them to the President's nominees. In light of its empirical, legal, and normative findings, this Article then proposes several statutory fixes to change how the executive branch employs acting officials and delegations of authority in the face of staffing vacancies-balancing concerns over accountability and the need for the government to function. Ultimately, this Article calls for thinking about actings and traditional appointees together. So many commentators have called for Congress to reduce the number of Senate-confirmed lower-level positions, mostly in agencies covered by the Vacancies Act. By largely ignoring temporary agency leaders, the forest may have been missed for the trees. Practically, by their prevalence, Presidents' extensive use of acting officials has achieved what Congress largely refuses to do.

N2  - This Article explores the failure of nominations and the delay in confirmation of successful nominations across recent administrations, with a focus on the November 2013 change to the Senate voting rules. Using a new database of all nonroutine civilian nominations from January 1981 to December 2014, there are several key findings. First, approximately one-quarter of submitted nominations between 1981 and 2014 were not confirmed, with a higher failure rate for the last two Presidents. Nominations to courts of appeals and independent regulatory commissions had much higher failure rates than other entities. Second, for confirmed nominations, the time to confirmation has been increasing. President Obama's nominees faced confirmation delays that were more than twice as long as President Reagan's choices. Failure rates of nominations did not always go hand-in-hand with confirmation delays for successful nominations. Although more nominations failed in divided government, confirmation delays were roughly equal when different parties controlled the Senate and the White House. Third, comparing the year after the change to the filibuster rules to the preceding year, confirmation times for the courts decreased but increased for all types of agencies. For many agencies and agency positions, however, significantly fewer nominations failed after the voting change. Even so, these improvements in 2014-to the confirmation rates for both agency and judicial nominees and to the confirmation pace for judicial picks-are relative: for the average nomination, the failure rate was higher and the confirmation process was slower than under preceding administrations. Fourth, nearly 30 percent of nominees hailed from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, raising concerns that the confirmation process may be narrowing the pool of top officials. This Article suggests some possible explanations for the findings and further avenues of investigation, and also proposes some reforms.

N2  - Federal agencies make an astounding number of policy decisions, engaging in more lawmaking and adjudication than Congress and the federal courts. These policy judgments range from the seemingly trivial, such as the size of holes in swiss cheese, to matters of life-and-death importance, such as how to limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. According to the statute books, over 1100 Senate-confirmed presidential appointees are supposed to run these agencies and direct these policy decisions, comprising a small but critically important component of a federal workforce of over 2.5 million employees. Yet filling these top-level positions in the federal administrative state is cumbersome, inconsistent, and at times controversial. New administrations are often quick to select the cabinet but take much longer to staff the next few layers. Appointee tenure is short, leading to many new openings a year or two later. Then agency officials flee government service near the end of an administration. Vacancies, particularly if frequent and lengthy, may have detrimental consequences for the modern administrative state. They contribute to agency inaction, foster confusion among nonpolitical employees, and undermine agency legitimacy. More surprising is that vacancies also can have beneficial repercussions for agency performance. Using new data from the Office of Personnel Management ({''}OPM'), this Article provides a systematic study of executive agency vacancies from President Carter to President George W. Bush. By one measure, Senate-confirmed positions were empty (or filled by acting officials), on average, one-quarter of the time over these administrations. These extensive vacancies have potentially far-reaching implications for constitutional and administrative law. Participants in debates over the unitary theory of the executive might want to spend less time analyzing the legitimacy of restrictions on the president's removal power and pay more attention to the absence of presidential appointments at the front end of the process. Commentators interested in congressional delegation of authority to agencies might consider how agency staffing affects adherence to congressional priorities and may limit broad delegations of authority. And scholars and courts interested in agency deference might contemplate how underlying theories of expertise and political accountability could incorporate empirical realities of political leadership in the federal bureaucracy. Changing legal doctrine may provide one mechanism for improving the staffing of executive agencies. Policy reforms outside of the courts targeted at reducing the number and length of vacancies-including appointee commitments to serve for two to four years, better training for new officials, and advance personnel planning by the White House-will, however, likely be more effective.

N2  - Contract law harmonization in the European Union has met with some significant but limited success. This Essay explores some of the psychological and political forces that can complicate or even hinder law reform efforts. Even when there is a general institutional drive for law reform, as there is in the EU, scarce reform resources force attention to be focused on salient issues, while a status quo bias in individual member states by government officials can provide a braking inertia regarding nonsalient legal reforms. This braking influence can be seized upon and enhanced by interest groups that oppose reforms, especially where there is an alternative to proposed law reforms for private entities. In the case of contract law harmonization, contract doctrine that is not focused on providing consumer protections remain nonsalient, commercial entities can solve the confusion of diverse laws by choosing their own, and interest groups in nations whose laws and dispute resolution forums are commonly chosen will oppose harmonization. Thus, the current state of affairs may prove relatively difficult to alter.

N2  - The political context of civil society in Western Europe has changed dramatically in recent decades. These changing circumstances may produce a decline in the integration of civil society into political life especially deliberative activities at the national level. This article discusses how serious these alleged threats are to a hitherto vital civil society that of Sweden. It focuses on fours indicators of organised civil society's contribution to deliberative democracy. First, have efforts to contact politicians, public servants and the media, as well as participation in public debates, decreased? Second, has civil society directed interest away from national arenas and instead concentrated resources in local and/or supranational arenas? Third, is there any evidence of a withdrawal from public activities, such as public debates and media activities in favour of direct contacts with politicians and public servants? Fourth, has civil society become more professionalised in the sense that interest groups are increasingly hiring professional consultants? Two surveys conducted in 1999 and 2005 show that Swedish organised civil society has not faded from national public politics. However, growing public participation is almost exclusively connected to increasing communication via the mass media and direct contact with politicians. Taking part in open public debate has not increased. The national arena has marginally lost some importance. Moreover, there is an increasing tendency to hire professional lobbying consultants. This might improve the quality of civil society's contributions to public deliberation, but a more elitist civil society might also develop, which is uninterested in social dialogue.

N2  - The article reviews the history of creation and an establishment of the public prosecutor's office in the territory of Kalmyk Autonomous Region in 1922. In the modern historical studies there is little data on the issue and this fact leads to different misinterpretations. The first part of the given article shortly describes the Soviet judicial system during Civil War of 1917-1921. It also analyzes its features, weak points and failures caused by the war as well as the reasons which led to the judicial reform in 1922 and contributed to the creation of public prosecution in Kalmyk autonomous region. On the basis of archive material, the most part of which is authentic in respect of the scientific value, the author reveals the features and peculiarities of prosecution activity in the region, analyses the results of the first month of its operation. A special attention is given to the work of prosecutor assistant Dmitry Elnitsky who executed the duties of regional prosecutor and greatly contributed to the formation and complementing the staff. Despite the fact that Elnitsky executed his duties on previous place of work in revolutionary tribunal he fulfilled faithfully his commitments in Prosecutor's Office. Unfortunately, officially appointed Prosecutor Ivanov who wasn't aware of the peculiarity of local nomadic way of life, ignored the results and achievements already made and started the implementation of his policy of prosecution which led to the dominance of bureaucracy and loss of an efficiency. Besides, he failed to get in contact with local Soviet Party organization and was given other job appointment as his successor. Only with a new local prosecutor the work of the prosecution office became efficient.

N2  - While studying political elites in Russia, many researchers pay little attention to the issue of social background and the impact it has on employment in institutions of power on various levels. This article aims to shed light on this issue. By examining the social demographics of political elites in Russia's multi-ethnic regions and major trends in their evolution, we argue that social background can be accepted as the key indicator for such analysis. We provide extensive data on how it influences the process of shaping the elites and the work of those who belong to this social group. Our study is based on comprehensive empirical research of political elites we conducted in Buryatia, Sakha (Yakutia) and Tuva in 2004-2010. During the Soviet period, the political elites, due to the ideology of the cadre policy, were primarily of proletarian or peasant background. In the postSoviet period, as attested by numerous researchers, the share of people with such backgrounds has significantly decreased. The current elites of Buryatia, Sakha (Yakutia) and Tuva are largely the descendants of intelligentsia and civil servants and are closely linked by birth to their regions. A large part of these elites were born in the countryside. The current system of recruitment and promotion of government officials, like the Soviet one, places crucial emphasis on informal selection mechanisms, including such factors as social background, kinship, territorial community, personal loyalty, patronage, etc. This is also indicated by the survey of the members of political elites of the three regions. Our study has shown that career promotion is heavily influenced by the experience of working side-by-side with the region's 'first persons', personal loyalty, patronage, kinship or 'homeboy' networks. © 2016 New Reaearch of Tuva.

N2  - By 10 January 2017, activists in the predominately Latina/o working class city of La Puente, California had lobbied the council to declare the city a sanctuary supporting immigrants, people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. The same community members urged the school district to declare itself a sanctuary. While community members rejoiced in pushing elected officials to pass these inclusive resolutions, there were multiple roadblocks reducing the potential for more substantive change. Drawing on city council and school board meetings, resolutions and my own involvement in this sanctuary struggle, I focus on a continuum of three overlapping and interlocking manifestations of white supremacist heteronormative patriarchy: neoliberal diversity discourses, institutionalized policies, and a re-emergence of high-profiled white supremacist activities. Together, these dynamics minimized, contained and absorbed community activism and possibilities of change. They reinforced the status quo by maintaining limits on who belongs and sustaining intersecting hierarchies of race, immigration status, gender, and sexuality. This extended case adds to the scant scholarship on the current sanctuary struggles, including among immigration scholars. It also illustrates how the state co-opts and marginalizes movement language, ideas, and people, providing a cautionary tale about the forces that restrict more transformative change.

N2  - In contending that military professionalism constitutes a guarantee of efficiency and has a zero-sum relationship with political control, Kolkowicz embraces an assumption that already has wide support. Roman Kolkowicz bases his assumptions about the adversary relationship on somewhat metaphysical grounds. Professional officers also concern themselves with controlling human behavior, and for control techniques they tend to turn to habit, tradition, and historical precedent, that is, considerations that can be included in Moore's third criterion, tradition. Ethnic representation in the Soviet high command suggests that members of some of the national minorities have found the military a route of upward social mobility. Personal cliques and coalitions of cliques take shape in bureaucracies, but they differ generically from interest groups. Selznick's category confusion seems to arise from a failure to treat both internal war and external war as particular cases ofthe general concept of "war." Engels focused on the potential for war between social groupings and institutions within the state.

N2  - The article discusses the evolution of the Visegrad partnership. It never had integrative capacity, but in recent years accumulated the integration potential in regional relations. The common position formation principles in international policy are being carried out by the Visegrad Four. Notable is the emergence of really important issues and explicit politicization of the agenda. The defense theme, the problem of energy security, coordination of positions on the EU budget etc. were included into discussions. At the same time, exacerbated contradictions exist in these areas. Key factors currently affecting the development of the Visegrad Group are: The confrontation of great powers in the region, the inert nature of relationship between the Visegrad countries and the United States, the anarchy in European policy, the prevalence of extra-regional conditions and incentives, the lack of specifi c regional rules and the void of its institutionalization. The Ukrainian crisis once again emphasizes the importance of the regional policy external actors - the U.S., Germany, Russia and the Brussels EU bureaucracy. It was the cause of the schism emerging in East European politics, and slowed down the process of the intra-regional incentives formation as well as of the communications concentration. It is forcing the Visegrad countries to grasp their limitrophe position. A perspective of the Visegrad partnership is unclear, but it is noteworthy that regional relations become increasingly important for their participants.

N2  - This article explores the formation and early history of the American Institute of the City of New-York, which in the 1830s became the leading lobby association of friends of industry in the United States. More specifically, the article considers how the institute's officers sought to overcome obstacles of collective mobilization that had plagued earlier pro-industry associations. Pre-Civil War interest groups is an understudied area, and historians typically depict the years following in the Compromise of 1833 as a period essentially devoid of pro-industry agitation. However, it was in precisely in these years that friends of industry for the first time managed to obtain the resources necessary for sustained mobilization. Key to the American Institute's success, this article argues, was the development of annual manufacturing fairs, events that provided steady revenue, strengthened internal cohesion, attracted new members, facilitated coordination with like-minded groups, and provided opportunities to engage in popular politics in an ordered manner.

N2  - Land registry worldwide provides best service for guaranteeing ownership of land and facilitates property transactions. The development and sustenance of effective land registry is vital for creation of free movement of interests in land. The land registry provides ready access to up-to-date land information and ensures confident dealings in property and security of title. One of the goals of land registry in developing economy and in Nigeria in particular, is to render services to users in satisfactory ways. This study therefore aimed at examining the users' performance evaluation of Akure Land Registry. One hundred and fifty (150) users of the Akure Land Registry, in Ondo state, Nigeria, comprises of professionals in the built environment were randomly selected and a structured questionnaire was administered on them. Data collected were rated on a five-point Likert scale and analyzed using factor analysis by principal component. The result of the factor analysis reduced the variables necessary for optimum performance of Akure Land Registry which may influence users' patronage of service into four factors: namely environmental factor and impact of bureaucracy; staff strength and competence; Users' friendliness of service provided; and organizational structure suitability. The four factors produced a cumulative loading of 73.84%. Therefore, the registry should pay attention to these factors to enhance the success in their service delivery to the users.

N2  - The main goal of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of the influence of NGOs on public policy-making in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement on December 14, 1995 in Paris. The sharp increase in the number of NGOs occurs immediately after the Dayton Accords, and according to some estimates, there were more than 1,500 at the time, which cannot be considered a large number when compared to the number of NGOs in other transition countries. Data from the Collective Register of Foundations and Associations in Bosnia and Herzegovina state that their total number is 25,646, while the number of actually active is difficult to determine. The literature so far has been presented from the non-governmental sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina to a significant extent for public policy making, as well as research results and these claims primarily based on the number of qualitative impact diaries of individual NGOs (case studies). This research paper aims at systematic research of the domain of influence of the non-governmental sector, through quantitative analysis of newly collected data on the influence of non-governmental organizations. The survey was proven at the local, cantonal, authorial and state level on a representative and stratified sample (10% - according to the statistical method) and was trained by the leadership and activists of non-governmental organizations and government officials (ministries and state administrative organizations). One of the main assumptions is that by successfully networking with organizations from neighboring EU member states, NGOs become a respectable actor in public policy-making in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition to quantitative analysis, this paper provides a detailed overview and theoretical analysis of civil society, NGO sector and public policies as well as a comparative insight into institutional and non-institutional mechanisms of NGO influence on public policy making in Bosnia and Herzegovina and their practical application in neighboring countries European Union. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the role of the non-governmental sector (association) in public advocacy and the analysis and comparison of current theories of the legal policy framework, structure, size, factors of development of the non-governmental sector. In addition, the paper contributes to the assessment of the current state of the mechanism of influence on the creation of public policy agendas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the formulation of measures for internal structures and networking of NGOs and the definition of their number, structure and types. The problem of the research is reflected in the fact that the started processes of transformation and the unfinished process of transition of the Bosnian society and civil sector are, due to the war destructions, significantly slowed down. Changes in society in the pre-war phase created realistic preconditions for the development of the non-governmental sector and civil society in general, and provided a realistic basis for influencing the advocacy and creation of various public policies. In the post-war period, international donors invested heavily in the NGO sector. The subject of this research is the influence of the non-governmental sector on policy-making processes, through knowledge of institutional mechanisms, as well as the correlation of the non-governmental sector and public policies from the aspect of democracy development as an integral process in all its aspects. Given that this topic has previously been partially addressed in this context, through a systematic review of the problem and offering an adequate solution to the problem, it is necessary to re-examine the key issues. The key issues explored within this paper are how networking with neighboring EU Member States has a positive impact (has a positive association) on the importance of NGOs in advocating for public policies. In addition, the extent to which financial support from EU institutions has a positive impact on the importance of NGOs in advocating for public policies has been explored. © 2021, Centar za istrazivanje moderne i savremene historije Tuzla.

N2  - The UN Secretariat’s role in the expansion of peacekeeping after the cold war is debated. Different theoretical accounts offer competing interpretations: principal–agent models and sociological institutionalism tend to emphasize the Secretariat’s risk-averse behaviour; organizational learning scholarship and international political sociology find evidence of the Secretariat’s activism; constructivism analyses instances of both. I argue that the UN Secretariat can be both enthusiastic and cautious about new tasks depending on the circumstances and the issue area. For example, UN officials have been the driving force behind the development of public information campaigns by peacekeeping missions aimed at the local population. During the cold war, it was not regarded as necessary for UN missions to communicate with the public in the area of operation: their interlocutors were parties to the conflict and the diplomatic community. With the deployment of the first multidimensional missions in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, UN staff realized the need to explain the organization’s role to the local population and provide information about UN-supported elections. In promoting this innovation, they played the role of policy entrepreneurs. The institutionalization of this innovation, however, was not an automatic process and required continuous advocacy by UN information staff. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - ``Functions of organization have been determined by dominating bureaucrats in power''. Thus if this is also true for ``change process'' (Ortayli (2000: 1-2), in twentieth century, administrative apparatus had changed very slowly. This also suggests that in order to better understand administrative structures, one should study administrative history. In Anatolia, where Turkey has placed geographically since X-XII centuries, a traditional culture has been living, and regional characteristics have dominated besides a central government system. We can have a look at this old world to better understand this new world: It has been the place where `writings had been used, bureaucracy and urbanization came into existence'. In terms of municipal governance, a traditional pattern would be traced as active local interaction partners. This paper tries to reflect on some traditional patterns to interpret today's municipalities of Turkey. It also refers modern urban interest groups and citizen participation.

To answer the question the paper analyses the Chilean administrative reform of 2003. It concludes that the reform created a hybrid system of appointment of top civil servants: one with elements of meritocracy but restricted to the members of the political coalition in power. Information came from 67 interviews to key actors, official documents, academic literature and the press.

N2  - Bureaucratic behavior in developing countries remains poorly understood. Why do some public servants—yet not others—work hard to deliver public services, misuse state resources, and/or participate in electoral mobilization? A classic answer comes from Weber: Bureaucratic structures shift behavior toward integrity, neutrality, and commitment to public service. Our study conducts the first survey experimental test of the effects of bureaucratic structures. It does so through a conjoint experiment with public servants in the Dominican Republic. Looking at merit examinations and job stability, we find that Weber was right—but only partially. Recruitment by examination curbs corruption and political services by bureaucrats, while enhancing work motivation. Job stability, by contrast, only decreases political services: Tenured bureaucrats are less likely to participate in electoral mobilization. Examinations thus enhance the quality of bureaucracy (motivation and lower corruption) and democracy (electoral competition); job stability only enhances the quality of democracy.

N2  - The article reviews the literature on the themes of the relationship between politics and bureaucracy and democratic control over the bureaucracy by analyzing three sets of works: Weber's production on the relationship between government and bureaucracy, the North American literature and national production. Weber's work allows us to establish with precision the central features of modern bureaucracy, its role in contemporary democratic government and the need for political control over bureaucracy. The debate in the U.S., in turn, explains the absence, in Brazil, the discussion on the relationship between politics and bureaucracy in a democratic perspective. Despite this absence, we analyze the contemporary literature in order to describe the present situation of the controls on the bureaucracy in Brazil and understand, even in incipient way, the mechanics of control, in particular the appointment, the budget, legislation and monitoring.

N2  - Since 9/11, the American policy towards Africa has been strongly influenced by national security interests and in particular by the fight against international terrorism and Islamic radicalisation. Traditionally, the American Africa policy has been the result of bureaucratic policymaking with the Pentagon and the State Department playing prominent roles. The paper argues that in the current century, evangelical Christian lobby groups have gained increasing influence on policymaking on Africa. Because policymaking has been influenced by a number of different actors, the American Africa policy may appear incoherent and ambiguous if judged narrowly on the expectation that it only aims to take care of US national security concerns and economic self-interests. The paper concludes that Africa was important to the United States during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama because of the combination of strong security interests and strong domestic lobby groups that have pressured to place Africa on the US foreign policy agenda.

N2  - Existing studies of business pressure group activity have examined individual chambers of commerce. This article considers the neglected theme of federated metropolitan chambers of commerce in the British Empire with a case study of an important business pressure group-the Joint West Africa Committee (JWAC) of the Liverpool, Manchester, and London Chambers of Commerce. It highlights, on the one hand, the tension between colonial officials and merchants over the content and direction of colonial policy. It also examines, on the other hand, the negotiation of divergent interests among the collaborating chambers themselves. In all, the JWAC was beleaguered by frequent internal questioning of its efficacy and relevance, recurring duels with the imperial and colonial governments, and the challenges of two world wars and decolonization. Its history suggests the relative autonomy of the state vis-a-vis national capital.

N2  - Through case studies of two South African metropolitan municipalities, Cape Town and Nelson Mandela Bay, the paper explores the way in which the economic advantages at the disposal of local government, referred to as rents, are distributed according to the power relations in cities. The city governance regimes are distinguished in the way that power is structured, the balance between formal and informal institutions, the nature of the rents allocated, and their developmental and spatial outcomes. Cape Town’s growth-oriented model, founded on intimate relationships between developers and the political elite, exercised centralized control over land rights, which were allocated to entrenched property interests. The weaker clientelist regime in Nelson Mandela Bay relied on a diminishing pool of procurement rents to sustain a decentralized patronage-based system. The paper uses a political settlements framework to understand how the configuration of power in each city is sustained by a particular distribution of rents, mobilized through informal institutions, which in turn impact the structuring of the bureaucracy. The spatial and developmental impacts of the case studies indicate that despite the better development outcomes of Cape Town, neither regime specifically advantages the urban poor. The paper concludes by suggesting ways in which political settlements theory can better account for bureaucratic autonomy and impacts on the space economy.

N2  - This paper examines the contribution of civil society, notably religious and faith-based groups, traditional institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), human rights groups, and community-based self-help groups, in promoting local-level peacebuilding in northern Uganda. Civil society groups in northern Uganda provided alternative narratives of the conflict, exposed brutalities against civilians, and ideas of peacebuilding. They lobbied, facilitated negotiations, engaged in building cultures of peace, promoted reconciliation, sustained livelihoods at the local level, and influenced outside peacebuilding interventions. However, the national context constrained their activities. This article is based on research and consultancy materials, personal observation, official and unofficial documents from the government, international organizations, intergovernmental agencies, and NGOs, newspaper reports, and scholarly publications.

The new regulations of the Penal Code bring important changes to the corruption crimes, being wished for the implementation of an effective system to fight against this scourge, in line with the EU requirements.

N2  - Developed societies generate a multitude of controversies between their members, which need to be resolved fairly if society is to function well. Judicial officers play a central role in that process by hearing and determining disputes according to law, but they are costly and their long tenure entrenches labour market rigidities. This is an inconvenience for modern governments, as they attempt to keep the wheels of justice turning, while facing budgetary constraints that drive them to seek ever greater cost-efficiencies. This article surveys the ways in which governments in Australia have sought to optimise the judicial labour force by creating a more flexible and cost-effective supply. The system of justice that has evolved in response to these developments is a complex one, with many complementary parts. There is no unique solution to the question of how many judicial officers society needs to quell disputes because this goal can be achieved in different ways. But great care needs to be taken to ensure that government action to find flexible sources of labour to meet the demand for judicial dispute resolution does not come at too high a price in terms of respect for the rule of law.

N2  - Background Among the many barriers to evidence use in decision-making, weak capacity for evidence use has attracted a lot of focus in the last decade. The study aims to inform and enrich ongoing and future efforts to strengthen capacity for evidence use by presenting and discussing the experiences and lessons of a project implemented in Kenya and Malawi to strengthen individual and institutional capacity for evidence use within the ministries of health (MoHs). Methods This paper draws on the internal and external evaluations of a 3-year project funded by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the Strengthening Capacity to Use Research Evidence in Health Policy (SECURE Health). To strengthen individual capacity, the project implemented a training and mentorship programme for 60 mid-level policy-makers in the two MoHs. To strengthen institutional capacity, the project conducted sustained advocacy with top leaders to strengthen structures that enable evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM), supported Kenya to develop research-for-health policies and priorities, supported Malawi to review the implementation of its health research agenda, developed EIDM guidelines for both MoHs, and supported bi-annual evidence dialogues to improve interactions and raise the profile of evidence. Internal evaluation included baseline and endline surveys (93 baseline and 92 endline interviews), 60 in-depth interviews, and intervention-specific evaluations (pre-post tests for training workshops, feedback forms for policy dialogues and tracking effects of advocacy efforts). The external evaluation was implemented alongside project implementation, conducting three annual evaluations. Results The results show that training and mentorship programmes in EIDM were effective in improving competencies of civil servants. However, such programmes need to train a critical mass to be effective in enhancing EIDM practice at the MoHs. On strengthening institutional capacity for EIDM, while the project achieved some success, it did not realise long-lasting effects because of its limited time of implementation and limited focus on sustained political economy analysis, which meant that the intervention was negatively affected by frequently changing interests within the MoHs. Conclusions Although training and mentorship are effective in improving EIDM competencies, they need to be incorporated in existing pre-service and in-service training programmes for sustainability. Strengthening institutional capacity for evidence use is complex and needs sustained political commitment and long-term investments.

N2  - This work proposes the term ‘naval elites’ in order to provide a new interpretation of social change in the eighteenth century from a comparative perspective. Naval elites, a social group formed by a part of the naval officer corps and midshipmen, are here defined as a historical instrument, the particular and intriguing features of which may be useful in the revision of some perspectives on social change. In particular, the authors analyse shifting power relationships through the reconsideration of naval patronage and bureaucracy, revisit the process of naval professionalization and the transformation of the concept of merit, and suggest that naval elites embodied new notions of social distinction and exclusiveness.

N2  - During the 1940s and 1950s, Kenya's African population received millions of pounds in colonial development and welfare funding. The majority was spent during the latter decade via the Swynnerton Plan, the largest and most complex instance of British planning in post-Second World War Africa. The plan's implementation coincidedthough not coincidentally-with the peak of the Mau Mau conflict.Kenya's Emergency' thrust the colony's central region into disorder. The Emergency itself largely concerned the Kikuyu, Kenya's most populous ethnic group. This article, however, focuses on the Kamba, the Kikuyus' eastern neighbours. The Kamba comprised the majority of Kenya's soldiers and police, though numbering only 11.6 per cent of its African population. Considered a martial race' by the British, the Kamba occupied an essential role in maintaining the colony's security. Highly aware of this pivotal position, British officials provided the Kamba with vastly disproportionate amounts of development funding in an attempt to dissuade them from harbouring sympathies with Mau Mau. Extraordinarily, the various datasets concerned with development spending in Kenya during the 1940s and 1950s reveal that the Kamba typically received more than 50 per cent of the entire colony's budget, far more than those Kikuyu loyalists' who scholars have assumed were the focus of the conflict-inspired funding bonanza.Despite officials' hopes, however, this controlling development' was never a neatly effective tactic to manage the lives of Africans. Kamba chiefs attempted to control and manipulate the notion and mechanics of the development agenda to best suit their own interests, with a high degree of success.

N2  - Patrons, big-men, brokers and fixers who mediate access to the state or the market inhabit complex, and often contradictory, moral spaces that awkwardly straddle reciprocity and unabashed self-interest, munificence and greed. These morally ambiguous figures have had a chequered history in studies of everyday life in South Asia, and beyond. In this literature, their penchant for turning social relations into a means to accumulate status, political power and capital often overshadows their ability to extend help or represent the interests of their clients in the face of market forces or the quagmires of state bureaucracies. Their know-how and know-who, many have argued, contribute to the (re)production of social hierarchies and inequalities, thus coming in the way of democratic participation and free market exchange. This chapter traces the ways in which modes of connectedness in Kerala-from the extended family to networks held together by the well-known figure of the broker or go-between-articulate with styles of networking in the Gulf, and especially with the Arab system of wasta, or ‘advantage via social connection’. By considering the role of connectedness and mediation in the everyday life of migrants and would-be migrants to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries of West Asia-for long a popular destination for hundreds of thousands of Keralan migrants-I aim to unsettle abstract moral evaluations which often inform distinctions drawn between the figures of patron and broker. © Cambridge University Press 2014.

Informal approval of corrupt activities in exchange for loyalty and compliance with the regime was commonplace in the former Soviet Union. This article explains how corrupt regimes maximize their position in terms of loyalty and compliance using the example of the 2004 presidential elections in Ukraine, which later became known as the Orange Revolution. The 2010 presidential elections and their aftermath pose new challenges to those aspiring to power. This article presents mechanisms by which political bureaucracies politicize universities in order to influence students and channel their electoral power during presidential campaigns.

It broadly features a wide array of confrontation, competition, monopolization of state institutions and resources by the party in power. This trend of politics has tremendously weakened the formal accountability mechanisms and put governance in crisis. This article depicts the nature of confrontational politics in Bangladesh, its causes and impacts on governance with supportive evidence from both primary and secondary sources. As case examples, it shows how bureaucracy and local government institutions are grossly politicized as a result of confrontational politics and their impact on governance. © 2010 Asian Journal of Political Science.

makes a case for a reconsideration of it. Two recent developments
motivate this effort: the rise of New Personnel Economics (NPE) as a
significant subfield of labor economics and the substantial shifts in
work organization that have taken place since the 1990s. Understanding
how and why firms have reorganized work opens the door for a renewed
interest in institutional approaches. The author explains that the rules
of institutional labor markets (ILMs) emerge from the competition
between organizational interest groups unions, personnel professionals,
and the government and competing views of firms' objectives, resulting
in the rise of ILMs, the slow diffusion of High Performance Work
Systems, strategies used to obtain a high level of commitment from
workers, the use of contingent employees, and the spread of new
promotion rules in response to equal employment opportunity pressures.
As such, the role of power and influence in establishing work rules is
of central concern, though more conventional NPE considerations also
remain important.

N2  - Corruption continues to be a leading threat to the global community. International legal institutions are interested in improving legal mechanisms for overcoming corruption among various categories of officials, including presidents, senior officials, parliamentarians, prosecutors, and judges. The subject of the study was the well-established criteria for selecting candidates for appointment to the post of judge, mainly moral and ethical, which are enshrined in international acts ratified in the Russian Federation. The study focuses on the honesty of judges as a legal phenomenon of international and national legislation. The article analyzes the Bangalore principles of judicial conduct as a set of legal norms and rules of conduct of judges addressed to states; the special status of judges in the implementation of the Convention on Human Rights is taken into account. This aspect was examined and presented in the fourth assessment report on the Russian Federation, adopted at the 77th plenary meeting of the GRECO (Group of States against Corruption). Using the comparative legal method of the study, the authors analyzed international and Russian legislative acts and, based on the results obtained, come to the conclusion that the trends in regulating requirements in terms of the moral and ethical qualities of judges coincide. According to the authors, an interrelated process is the development of a method for reliable assessment of moral and ethical qualities of candidates for the position of judge. The analysis of published sources shows that there are no doctrinal studies on this issue, but also no common practical recommendations from practitioners who are familiar with the real situation in terms of selecting candidates for courts of various instances. The formal legal method of research has shown that at present it is almost impossible to regulate the essential moral categories, but the demand for an exact definition of the concepts ``justice{''}, ``honesty{''}, ``equality of law{''} of the public legal consciousness has actually reached the maximum pre-crisis point. As long as the law does not clearly define the boundaries of the term, each legal entity will put its own meaning in this term, which usually leads to conflicts, including internal ones. Judges as subjects of legal relations need a standard definition of ethical categories more than others. The inner qualities of the judge as a person should determine the judge as a professional. For the first time, the authors make specific proposals for implementing the recommendations given to the Russian Federation by GRECO in determining the criteria for ``honesty{''} as an integral moral quality of a judge. The proposals can be used in the development of professional standards, as well as in the preparation of ethical codes and rules for regulating judicial conduct.

N2  - In Ukraine, women constitute a third of all new HIV infections, and injection drug use accounts for nearly half of HIV infections among women. Women who use drugs (WWUD) often have diminished access to drug use treatment, HIV care, and other health and social services or underutilize women-specific services such as maternal health services. While interpersonal and contextual factors diminish access to and utilization of services among WWUD, rules, processes, and bureaucratic structures also systematically exclude women from accessing services and resources. Institutions, bureaucratic processes, and instruments of legibility such as documents regulate who can and cannot access services and raise questions about "deservingness." In this paper, we use the lens of bureaucracy to explore paperwork as a form of structural violence through its production of "legible" citizens, often through reinforcement of gender stereotypes and moral narratives of deservingness. Between December 2017 and October 2018, we interviewed 41 medical and social service providers and 37 WWUD in two Ukrainian cities. Our analysis revealed that requirements for internal passports and residency permits-the primary state apparatus through which rights to services are granted in Ukraine-compelled participants to continually render themselves visible to the state in order to receive services, despite financial, logistical and other challenges that undermined women's ability to obtain documents. These requirements exposed them to new forms of stigma and exclusion, such as reduced opportunities for employment and losing custody of children. Nongovernmental organizations, due to funding cuts, curtailed direct services such as support groups but became liaisons between clients and the state. They enforced new narratives of deservingness, such as the ability to define "good" behavior or reward social relationships with agency staff. Ukraine's current reforms to social safety net institutions present an opportunity to interrogate underlying assumptions about spheres of responsibility for the country's most marginalized and stigmatized groups.

N2  - This article explores the new political subjectivities that are emerging in disadvantaged communities in Kyrgyzstan following post-Soviet state transformation and retreat. It explores the ways in which the collapse of the Soviet-era bureaucracy and emergence of a marketising yet rent-seeking state bureaucracy has facilitated the emergence of `active citizens' in self-built shanty towns in two locations in Kyrgyzstan - the capital, Bishkek, and the Issyk Kul resort region in the east. Based on participant observation and research interviews with members of so-called `self-help groups' in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan, in which residents co-organise to lobby local government for basic amenities and pool funds to raise money for community infrastructure and services in the absence of a functioning state, the paper makes two contributions to understanding the nature of citizenship in the context of weak, post-Soviet states. First, it suggests that, rather than seeing self-organised citizens as a threat to stability - a perspective common to non-liberal governments - these initiatives are supported and encouraged by the Kyrgyz authorities, since they perform tasks and provide services in lieu of the weak state. Autonomous citizens who can take responsibility for their own welfare are useful when the state cannot provide adequate services. Hence, leaders of weak states are able to recontextualise global neoliberal discourses of active citizenship, which emphasise autonomous, rational citizens, in order to legitimise their functional inabilities. Second, it seeks to problematise the binary distinction between the `passive Soviet citizen' and the modern, post-Soviet active citizen, evident in government and international NGO discourses, and suggests that the idea of the `passive Soviet citizen' is a discursive trope utilised to distinguish desirable from undesirable subjectivity in the post-Soviet market state.

N2  - Elected officials have difficulty controlling politically insulated institutions, leaving the appointment process as perhaps their most effective means of influence. Yet, history shows that actors on these institutionsespecially the Supreme Courtoften behave unpredictably. Our goal is to determine whether variation in two components of cognitive style, prior to a justices nomination to the Court, predicts ideological drift once on the Court. Using linguistic software created by cognitive psychologists, we examined over 1000 speeches, articles, and separate opinions written by Supreme Court justices before they were nominated to the Court. Our results show that justices whose prenomination words revealed cognitive inconsistency drift more than those with stable world views.

N2  - Abstract This article examines the contribution of clans (kinship institutions) to the administration of justice within the context of standards set out in the African regional human rights instruments. Field work on the Jopadhola of Eastern Uganda is drawn upon, to explore how clans reproduce their notion of an independent court using an abridged legal doctrine of separation of powers, and partially mimicking lower level government and judicial features. The field work also shows how clans accommodate interests of women and youth. Even so, clans retain a largely customary approach to the appointment, qualifications and tenure of court officials. The main findings lead to the conclusion that, by applying an âœAfricanâ notion of human rights, clans have created traditional constructs of an independent court: one that is culturally appropriate for their indigenous communities.

N2  - This essay explores the rise and decline of regulatory independence in Turkey. Framing the ongoing process of limiting independence of these agencies as the politics of de-delegation, it raises the question of why Turkish regulatory agencies have become subject to increasing political intervention. Contending that institutional legacies and mounting illiberal predispositions of the Turkish state facilitate the politics of de-delegation, the essay focuses on centralization, executive discretion, and politicization of bureaucracy as the major institutional legacies. Then it briefly discusses formal and informal mechanisms of political intervention, which have impaired the independence of the regulatory agencies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

N2  - `Public Servant' is a vital concept in the practice Of Criminal Law, since under Turkish Penal Code, some actions are considered crime only if the perpetrator/victim is a civil servant Turkish. Moreover, with respect to some crimes, the perpetrator/victim's civil servant status is seen as an aggravating factor. Article 6/l-c of Turkish Penal Code No. 5237, which was put into effect on I June 2005, defines the term `public servant as `a person who holds a government position by election or appointment and who participates in public activities and actions'. The term `public activity', being used by the Turkish Penal Code is in fact not an embedded concept. Therefore, the problem of determining who is and who is not a public servant still persists in the practice of penal codes. In order to eliminate this problem, firstly, case laws reported when Law No. 765 was in force should be taken as basis. In others words, people conducting civil services should be considered public servants. Besides, in view of the lawmaker's purpose in enforcing the said provision, regarding on v a small part of those conducting public services as civil servant might prevent inclusive understanding of the `civil servant' concept, thus avoiding drawbacks in respect of constitutional state.

N2  - This paper aims to fill in the gap in research on the effect of pharmaceutical lobbying on drug reimbursement policy, particularly in Poland, a post-communist country. To this end, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured, anonymous, elite interviews in Poland, supplemented by a review of legislation, policy documents, official reports and press articles, as well as observations. Overall, 109 representatives of stakeholders involved in reimbursement policy were interviewed. We identified two key lobbying methods: informal persuasion and third-party endorsements. These methods are coupled with two supplementary ones: lobbying through parliament and ministries, as well as diplomatic pressure. Pharmaceutical lobbying methods in Poland clearly resemble those used in other European countries. What is notable about the Polish case is extensive reliance on informal lobbying and diplomatic pressure.

N2  - Political Scientists have widely explored why legislatures pass campaign finance regulations and how these laws condition the influence of organized interests over elected officials. Studies have not explained how state houses can overcome entrenched interests, to pass more restrictive legislative lobbying laws. Interest group pressure can be overcome when routine politics are impacted by agenda-setting environments and broader state political contexts that prompt the passage of legislative lobbying reforms. Findings suggest that although moralistic political culture and political scandals set the agenda for stricter regulation, the prospects for reform are tempered by the power of organized interests in state houses.

N2  - The U.S. Supreme Court is not a unitary actor and it does not function in a vacuum. It is part of an integrated political system in which its decisions and doctrine must be viewed in a broader context. In some areas, the Court is the lead policy maker. In other areas, the Court fills in the gaps of policy created in the legislative and executive branches. In either instance, the Supreme Court's work is influenced by and in turn influences all three branches of the federal government as well as the interests and opinions of the American people. Pacelle analyzes the Court's interaction in the separation of powers system, detailing its relationship to the presidency, Congress, the bureaucracy, public opinion, interest groups, and the vast system of lower courts. The niche the Court occupies and the role it plays in American government reflect aspects of both the legal and political models. The Court has legal duties and obligations as well as some freedom to exercise its collective political will. Too often those studying the Court have examined it in isolation, but this book urges scholars and students alike to think more broadly and situate the highest court as the "balance wheel" in the American system.

N2  - American policymakers delegate the administration of many welfare programs to states, where officials implement them in increasingly diverse ways. Welfare state scholarship has little to say about this subnational policy divergence, and it portrays the complexity of delegated governance as a barrier to nonelite legislative influence. Drawing on an ethnographic study of one state's Medicaid program, this article shows that delegated governance offers ample opportunity for nonelite influence and policy divergence, but through regulatory governance rather than legislative advocacy. Medicaid is opaque to politicians, whose inability to monitor program details creates conditions of bureaucratic autonomy and even activism: health-care agency personnel sequence regulatory tweaks to protect and expand entitlements. But budget cuts, outsourcing, and fraught provider relations also deprive bureaucrats of street-level know-how, and bureaucrats depend on beneficiaries' advocates who selectively illuminate a path to reform. A full rendering of subnational divergence in American federalism requires attention to underexamined factors such as bureaucratic activism, agency advocacy, and regulatory governance.

N2  - The expression 'Whitehall Model' has a certain heuristic value for describing four key features of the British civil service, namely political neutrality, generalism, life-long career paths and a strong policy advisory role. This model has been challenged by politicization, changes in career management and recruitment as well as increasing competition from other sources of policy advice. The UK civil service's role in relation to ministers seems to have become increasingly defined in managerial terms and decreasingly as policy advisers, not least because a range of other individuals and bodies (advisers, consultants, think tanks, party research departments) now share this role. While it appears to be enjoying a diminishing policy role, the senior civil service has not, at least so far, managed to occupy the high ground in its managerial role. The biggest change in the model is a collapse of confidence in the civil service, not only among citizens, but also among politicians and civil servants themselves. © The Author(s) 2010.

N2  - This article analyses key elements of the Thaksin government's public sector reform program since 2001 in the context both of a longer history of public sector reform in Thailand, and of Thaksin's style of political rule. Carefully chosen instruments of new public management reform such as budgeting for results and performance management have been accompanied by an agenda of wholesale restructuring of the bureaucracy. However, these instruments do not include many familiar items of the public management reform agenda. The reforms are best viewed as part of a politicisation strategy aimed at asserting political control at the centre. Managerial reforms are being deployed to reshape the bureaucracy into an instrument of the Thaksin government's political program. In the process, the traditional power of the bureaucracy is being challenged and undermined. The longer-term impact of the bureaucratic modernisation program on administrative performance is less certain.

N2  - The authors of this book argue that changing recruitment patterns and career profiles of Australian federal MPs - analyzed in the context of trends towards factionalized patronage parties, opportunistic populism, party-bureaucratic careers and increasing fast tracking to the top - have reduced the parliamentary elite's quality, particularly since the 1990s. The declining quality of the Australian 'political class' is a major factor underlying the decline in public trust and confidence in federal parliamentarians. Major parties in Australia are weakened by voter-party dealignment, factional divisions, falling trust and declining membership. They gradually abandon the systematic recruitment and grooming of leaders, attempting instead to pick emerging leaders and vote winners: factional loyalists, media celebrities, and skillful party functionaries. This trend is aggravated by relentless media exposés that undermine the system of political recruitment by skewing it towards the selection of party bureaucrats, demagogues, celebrities and PR experts. © Jan Pakulski and Bruce Tranter, 2015.

N2  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the main legislative acts adopted in Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1939 that determined the legal status of civil servants in the Third Reich and regulated all aspects of their life and work. The main aspects of the problem are considered in terms of various approaches to the selection of criteria for legal progress, which actualizes the stated topic and allows considering the aspects of the legal life of the Third Reich previously neglected by researchers. The present work particularly focuses on the policy of Nazification of the public service sector, i.e. the racial component of the development strategy of Nazi bureaucratic law, in particular the discriminatory provisions of the Law on the Restoration of Professional Bureaucracy of 1933 and the Law on German Bureaucracy of 1937, on the basis of which access to the bureaucracy was closed to representatives of the ``non-Aryan{''} population of Germany. Emphasis is put on the fact that, despite the dissatisfaction of part of the bureaucracy with their financial situation and lengthening of the working week, most public servants remained faithful to the regime throughout its existence, acting as a reliable support.

N2  - Former government officials have many different opportunities to cash in on their public service, but most academic research and government ethics regulations focus on lobbying. We argue that this focus understates the extent and diversity of employment opportunities available to former officials. Using a new data set of officeholders in American government (members of Congress, governors, members of the cabinet, executive branch officials, and ambassadors), we show that, with the exception of members of the House, former officials are more likely to join boards of public companies than they are to work as registered lobbyists. Furthermore, former officials join boards more quickly and face fewer ethics regulations compared to lobbyists. Increasing restrictions on lobbying also appears to push former officials toward alternative employment such as board service. Our findings demonstrate the breadth of the labor market for former politicians and suggest fruitful new avenues for research on political careers.

N2  - This article explores how health governance has evolved into an enormously complicated—and inequitable and exclusionary—system of privatized, fragmented bureaucracy, and argues for addressing these deficiencies and promoting health justice by radically deepening democratic participation to rebalance decision-making power. It presents a framework for promoting four primary outcomes from health governance: universality, equity, democratic control, and accountability, which together define health justice through deep democracy. It highlights five mechanisms that hold potential to bring this empowered participatory mode of governance into health policy: participatory needs assessments, participatory human rights budgeting, participatory monitoring, public health care advocates, and citizen juries. © 2020 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics.

N2  - Do agency officials hold influence over the policy decisions made by state legislators and governors? For years, scholars have asserted the important informational role that bureaucrats play within the U.S. policy-making process. However, we have only limited knowledge of the theoretical mechanisms that may allow for this influence, or ultimately, whether this influence matters to public policy outcomes. We theorize that the political oversight of the bureaucracy by elected officials not only constrains the bureaucracy but also provides a pathway for agency officials to advance their preferences by communicating their policy expertise. We assess this argument with survey data from almost 600 state agency heads, drawn from the 50 states and across all agency types. Using a multilevel model, we find that the ``oversight mechanism'' is a key driver of agency influence over gubernatorial policy decisions; however, it does a poor job explaining agency policy influence within state legislatures. These results suggest that oversight allows agency leaders greater success in lobbying governors than more diffuse and diverse state legislatures.

N2  - While the Europeanisation literature has examined several aspects of EU
transgovernmental cooperation under the European Neighbourhood Policy
(ENP), very little is yet known as to the extent and the conditions
under which such cooperation effectively transfers EU norms to ENP
countries. Using a qualitative comparative analysis of 32 Twinning
projects in Ukraine, the article finds that legal and institutional
convergence with EU norms has occurred mainly because of the policy fit

N2  - NGOs deploy multiple approaches to achieve their objectives. These may broadly be classified as bottom up and top down. While a bottom-up approach emphasises local decision making, community participation and grassroots mobilisation/movements, the top-down approach focuses on lobbying and bargaining with the decision-making authorities such as government agencies, building up of pressures through various campaign mechanisms, advocacy activities, etc. This article draws insights from the literature and begins with a discussion on approaches undertaken by grassroots NGOs to meet their objectives. At the outset, the article ponders over a set of questions such as whether grassroots NGOs essentially follow a bottom-up approach. If so, why? Do they also intend to establish rapport with the state officials and thereby have say in the decision-making process? If so, how do they pursue it? This article, however, operationalises the bottom-up approach in terms of an array of indicators such as awareness building efforts of NGOs, people's participation in different phases of projects, and people's involvement in creating people's institutions. Similarly, it defines top-down approach on the basis of indicators such as NGOs’ participation in advocacy activity, obtaining support from government authority and obtaining favourable court verdicts. Despite the rhetoric, this article conclusively finds that no grassroots NGO practices either a bottom-up or top-down approach exclusively.

N2  - This paper studies IT business value in the public sector organizations, to which the information systems (IS) literature so far has paid little attention. Specifically, we investigate the moderating effect of IT governance on the relationship between IT investments and government performance. Drawing upon the theory of political control on bureaucracy from the political sciences literature, we hypothesize that the presence of legislative controls on IT management increases returns to IT spending, which are measured by cost efficiency. Our empirical analysis in the context of U.S. state governments shows that formal establishment of a chief information officer (CIO) position by legislation is a key prerequisite to positive returns from IT expenditures in state governments. Also, the impact of IT spending on state cost efficiency increases when a state senate approves appointment of CIO nomination than when it does not. This study contributes to the IS literature by demonstrating the importance of elected representatives as part of IT governance in the public sector organizations.

N2  - Integrating political, bureaucratic, industrial and healthcare systems has been a major challenge for politics of innovation and development policy in low- and middle-income countries. This challenge has so far been understood in terms of separate industrial and health-related innovation policies without paying adequate attention to the institutional roles of biopharmaceutical and other umbrella associations. This article seeks to examine such roles in the developmental contexts of South Africa and India. The argument put forward is that, in both countries, biopharmaceutical and umbrella associations have evolved from lobbying organizations to institutional partners who influence the politics of innovation and development—and therefore the degree of integration and fragmentation—of political, bureaucratic, industrial innovation and health systems.

N2  - In the United States, the executive branch possesses virtually unbridled authority to keep national security information from the public. Although the Freedom of Information Act and whistleblower protection laws serve as some check on the executive's power, these tools remain largely ineffectual. Because the desire for tight information control competes with the demands ofnewsgathering, a "game of leaks" has developed among government officials and reporters in which the press alternatively serves as lapdogs, watchdogs, and scapegoats for the executive branch. This Article demonstrates that the government has been communicating information to the public through leaks ever since the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt. Legal developments in the current climate, including the ongoing prosecution of two lobbyists for violations of the Espionage Act in the AmericanIsraeli Public Affairs Committee case, have the potential to establish precedents that could impose dire consequences upon this crucial information flow. This Article scrutinizes the constitutionality of prosecuting nongovernmental parties for the publication of classified information by examining the long and complicated history of the relationship between the press and the executive branch, and the role leaks play in the dissemination of classified information to the public today. After examining the relationship between the press and the executive branch, as well as tracing the development of the reasoning behind the applicable First Amendment doctrine, this Article ultimately argues that in any prosecution against a nongovernmental actor for disseminating national security information, the government must demonstrate not only that the disclosure posed an immediate, serious, and direct threat to national security, but also that the offender either intended the disclosure to harm the United States or help a foreign nation, or that the offender was recklessly indifferent to the harm that the disclosure would cause. Given that the executive branch has so much power to control the dissemination of national security information to the public, and itself leaks information to support its agenda, its power to punish the publication of leaks must be extremely limited. An intent requirement is consistent with the Supreme Court's free speech jurisprudence and helps achieve this goal. An intent requirement will encourage the government and the press to continue their historical cooperation when the publication of certain information poses a serious threat to national security interests. It will create an incentive for government officials to explain their national security concerns to the press, and it will simultaneously hold the press accountable for any reckless disregard shown toward genuine threats. This approach seeks to strike the proper balance between the executive branch's vast ability to control the dissemination of national security information to the public - often through calculated leaks - and the need to maintain the secrecy of information that is truly sensitive.

N2  - The authors compare the appointments of the heads of regulatory agencies made with the participation of the Senate with those made either discretionally by the President, or through the system of High Public Directorship, i.e., an appointing procedure that seeks to reconcile the need to stimulate appointments of candidates with strong technical credentials, with the political interests of the incumbent government. The analysis of near 200 appointments made in Chile between 1990 and 2016, shows that the heads of regulatory agencies chosen with the involvement of the Senate have similar levels of political affiliation, but better overall professional credentials compared to the results achieved by other institutional models. Our evidence also suggests that the tenure of those officers is two times longer, and it is three times more likely that they remain in office after the installation of a new government. The article provides useful evidence to advance the discussion about the impact of the institutional appointing models on the autonomy of those institutions. There is a significant correlation between formal and material independence of Chilean regulatory agencies, as well as showing the importance of the Senate in the system of check and balances for appointing regulators.

N2  - This paper presents a comparative case study of diverse approaches to deinstitutionalization of developmental disabilities residential services in two Midwestern states. During the 1970s and 1980s, the convergence of leadership by advocates, legislators, and bureaucrats led to Michigan's rapid transformation from an institutional to a community-based system, which was further facilitated by a political culture open to innovation. In contrast, during the same period in Illinois, fragmented leadership by advocates of community services, and the power held by unions, parents of institutionalized children, and private service providers worked for retention of institutions and against development of community residential services. Illinois' political culture, state governmental structure and bureaucracy also actively impeded innovation and further hindered the development of community homes. Implications for today's advocates are drawn from a comparative historical review.

N2  - Although international organizations (IOs) and their secretariats play
important roles in international politics, we know surprisingly little
about their staffing composition and the factors that shape it. What
accounts for the national composition of the secretariats of IOs? We
theorize that the national composition of international secretariats is
shaped by three factors: the desire by powerful states for institutional
control, a commonly shared interest in a secretariat's functional
effectiveness, and, increasingly, a need for secretariats to be seen as
legitimate by being representative of the global population. Building on
recent constructivist literature, we argue that IOs face increasing
normative pressure to be representative in their staffing patterns.
Using panel regression, we assess our argument with a new dataset
covering states' representation in the secretariats of thirty-five
United Nations system bodies from 1997 to 2015. The results indicate
that while functional effectiveness plays a significant and stable role,
international secretariats have become increasingly representative of
the global population. Moreover, this has come primarily at the expense
of the over-representation of powerful states. This shift from power to
representation is particularly strong in large IOs with high political
and societal visibility. When it comes to IO secretariats,
representativeness (increasingly) matters.

N2  - This study investigates the economic impact after stock price crash risk. First, we examine the cost of debt after stock price crash risk. The rate of return on investment required by an investor is positively related to the level of risk, therefore the cost of debt will increase relatively. Secondly, we examine the possible effect of political connections of outside directors on the relationship between stock price crash risk and the cost of debt. There are doubts whether ex-bureaucrat outside directors are used as expensive insurance, so-called lobbyists for the company, regarding to the reason of appointment ex-bureaucrat outside directors. Using the firms listed from 2010 to 2017, our findings are follows. First, the risk of stock price crash increase the cost of debt. The higher the risk of stock price crash, the higher the borrowing rates and the lower bond ratings. Secondly, we find weak evidence that the companies with ex-bureaucrat outside directors show lower cost of debt even after stock price crash risk. This indicates that the effect of stock price crash risk on cost of debt is different between the companies with ex-bureaucrat outside directors and without ex-bureaucrat outside directors. It is meaningful in that we attempt to find the incentives to appoint ex-bureaucrats as outside directors and their external influence. We expect the results of this study will help regulatory agency to make the policy and operate of outside director system. © 2020, Korean Accounting Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - This study identifies the determinants of appointment of executives in quangos. Using data from 85 quangos in Korea over 15 years between 1993 and 2007, we investigate the degree to which various characteristics of organizational actors affect the choice of executives. Three organizational actors include presidents, sponsoring government departments, and the concerned quangos. Although results vary by executive position, the findings of the empirical analysis with multinomial probit and generalized linear mixed models support the idea that the appointment of quango executives is not the result of presidential choice but that of the interactions among the key organizational actors, with different incentives and resources, on the appointment. Compared to former bureaucrats, presidential allies are more likely to be appointed when presidents have more political support from the National Assembly and it is easier for insiders to be promoted as executives from larger and older quangos with clear legal origins. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Presidents have the power to nominate the top ranks of the executive branch and they use it toward their own goals. Presidents need a mixture of experienced and loyal officers to promote bureaucratic competence and responsiveness, and advance their policies within the executive branch, but scholars' focus has often been senatorial obstructionism rather than when presidents prefer loyal nominees and experienced nominees. This study uses a sample of 573 subcabinet nominations between 1961 and 2006, and relates presidents' nominee choices to their policy priorities and departmental jurisdictions. It finds that presidents nominate significantly more loyalists and fewer experienced officers to higher priority departments, indicating the importance of responsiveness, as well as their suspicion of experienced officers. Presidents select more experienced nominees for lower priority departments to assure competence where they are least concerned with responsiveness. Furthermore, it finds that increased Senate ideological opposition has no significant effect on presidents' selections.

N2  - This article develops a classificatory framework for analyzing advocacy group strategy in S&T policy domains - an area of increasing citizen activism since the 1960s. In such domains, activists may be locked out by what I call the 'expertise barrier', which blocks those lacking specialized knowledge from full participation. This article argues that activists' strategies to break through the expertise barrier can be classified into four categories: deploying established expertise, introducing new kinds of facts, introducing new policy-making logics, and attacking bureaucratic rules. It suggests further that focusing research on these four categories can facilitate hypothesis generation and future avenues of inquiry, including comparison among advocacy challenges in diverse technical domains. To illustrate this framework, I present examples from activism in two areas: breast cancer research and patents on life forms. © Beech Tree Publishing 2010.

N2  - Drawing on my recent research with aid workers in Jordan and Lebanon, as well as on examples from Greece and Italy, in this commentary I propose the concept of care work as one of the possible ways to achieve a grounded critical understanding of welcome, one that goes beyond solidarity versus institutionalization, bureaucracy versus generosity and state versus civil society dichotomies. Framing the issue in such a way means asking three fundamental questions: not only, as Gill poignantly does, what is welcome, but also where is welcome actually located and, most importantly, who welcomes. These questions illuminate the many overlooked forms of affective and physical labour without which state-centred, institutional, and internationally organized aid and "welcome" would not be possible. The task, I contend, is to unearth the labour of care that the governance of migration and refuge requires, labour that is mostly feminized, racialized, and precarious. By illuminating the forms of care and interdependencies upon which the reproduction of our societies depends - in all its aspects, including border regimes - this perspective opens up an emancipatory pathway to the politicization of welcoming and aid to migrants and refugees, alternative to humanitarian discourses.

N2  - The amount of privately conserved land is increasing worldwide. The potential of these areas to contribute to the global conservation of biodiversity is significant, given that statutory protected areas alone will not suffice. Nevertheless, there is still inadequate support for private conservation areas, and further research on appropriate, flexible, and generally applicable incentive measures is necessary. We conducted 25 semistructured interviews with the owners of private conservation areas in the Little Karoo, South Africa, to examine landowner opinions of existing conservation policies and their relationships with the local conservation authority. We also assessed landowner preferences regarding conservation incentive measures. Landowners doubted the conservation authority's capacity to implement its stewardship program and were also discouraged by the bureaucracy of the program. The conservation authority was often viewed negatively, except where landowners had experienced personal contact from conservation staff or where strong social capital had formed among landowners. Landowners did not desire financial rewards for their conservation efforts, but sought recognition of their stewardship role and greater involvement from the conservation authority through personal contact. We conclude that conservation policies for private lands could benefit from the provision of extension services to landowners, promotion of formation of groups of landowners and other stakeholders, and public acknowledgment of the contributions private conservation areas make.

N2  - In 2009, following several countries including Burundi and Nigeria, a proposal was introduced in Rwanda to criminalize same-sex sex and lgbt activism. However, unlike the other countries, Rwanda's Article 217 criminalization proposal was eliminated within months of its introduction. While this result can be understood as a success story, it also can elide the obstacles Rwandan activists experience when organizing for lgbt people. The cross-movement coalition that formed to oppose Article 217 specifically adopted a nonconfrontational strategy designed to work within the authoritarian political system in Rwanda. While activists framed the removal of Article 217 as aligned with existing government priorities, the dialogue strategy has clear limits when activists' goals are to make further changes in Rwanda, particularly when government officials do not see further changes as aligned with their priorities. A combination of the authoritarian system and the government's focus on economic development and individual advancement narrowly circumscribe what types of activism the government will accept. This imperative to conform to government expectations means activists adopt rhetoric and encourage lgbt people to engage in activities that are focused on how they appear as individuals. This focus on the individual elides the wider structural problems that exist in Rwanda that perpetuate discrimination againstlgbt people, particularly those who experience multiple marginalizations. Lgbt activism is circumscribed so it can occur in Rwanda, but this has consequences for how much change is advocated for and who benefits from this activism.

N2  - This chapter focuses on a strong three-party scenario that emerged in Malawi in 1994, with the establishment of multiparty democratic order where the opposition could participate fairly effectively in exercising their accountability role through the parliamentary committee system. It analyses the Malawian Parliament’s oversight role during the critical junctures and draws conclusions on the prospects for it to play this role more effectively. A myriad of factors impede the objectivity and efficiency of parliamentary committees in countries like Malawi, including lack of technical expertise, inadequate resources and various types of pressure from administrative officials and party leaders. The strained executive-legislature relations impeded the functioning of the legislature in many ways like curtailed sittings of Parliament, and less frequent meetings of parliamentary committees. In a political system where patronage and clientelist practices are deeply imbedded, there are an abundance of opportunities for corruption in the bureaucracy and in wider political circles.

At the same time, the paper narrates why and how 'stabilized-population' is the most important and an indispensable crucial issue for the overall socio-economic and technological development of India. It says that almost all the problems of India such as environment, housing, food, illiteracy, transportation, water, mass migration or unemployment, and so on; are the products or by-products of uncontrolled spiraling of population. It weighs the impact of 'spill-over population' on agriculture, food security, employment, housing, education, electricity, poverty, water, economy, etc. The paper briefs the importance of 'population' in Five-Year Plans. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) has a lion's share in the paper with the logic how policy advocacy at all levels such as political, legislative and executive; could make this issue of spiraling-population a peoples' movement and how every citizen could be a 'change-agent' in this endeavour, what kind of 'policy-changes' are indispensable for 'stabilising-population.' The paper mentions that family-welfare communication has been a neglected area in India, though it is the first-ever country to have a nationwide family welfare programme. It adds that there is a yawning gap between planning and implementation of population-welfare programmes in the country that demands professional expertise from communication-alchemists with maverick ideas to make the things click. It also includes a developmental communication-model which could be applied for bringing the desired-changes for stabilizing population. © 2013, National Institute of Health and Family Welfare.

N2  - Religion has remained a contested issue in Bangladesh and the debate between the “sacred” and the “secular” on the place of religion in politics has been one of the contentions. The “sacred” argue that Bangladesh was founded on Islam as its ideology, as the state creation cannot be separated from 1947, and therefore, it does not have a secular future. The “secularist” insists that the 1971 liberation war and the fact that Bangladesh broke away from the Islamic state of Pakistan affirms its secular future. Within this contested space, a legacy of highly divisive political culture has been nurtured which makes the politics in Bangladesh a zero sum game and reduces its capacity to fight Islamist extremism and terrorism in an effective manner. This political culture also has a historical legacy. Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, known as the father of the nation, who shaped Bangladesh’s political destiny after its liberation, made secularism one of the founding principles of Bangladesh and General Zia-ur-Rahman, former Army Chief of Staff who became the President of Bangladesh and founder of the Bangladesh National Party amended its secular constitution, legalized religious parties and changed Bengali nationalism from an ethno-linguistic identity to Bangladeshi nationalism, a religion-based identity. Reconciliation between various groups, especially, the groups that considered themselves as liberators of Bangladesh from the “occupation forces” and collaborators - the religious party members who helped the Pakistan Army against the war of liberation - have made cooperation between the two main political contenders impossible. Therefore, one sees a polarized polity that is divided between the left oriented parties - the Awami League and other communist parties - and the centre right, the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and the religious parties. The religious parties were banned in 1972. However, Sheikh Mujib’s assas- sination paved the way for the legitimization of religious political parties for two reasons. First, Zia needed the help of the rightist elements to legitimize his rule and second, his Bangladeshi nationalism created a space for the religious political parties to play a role in the propagation and consolidation of this nationalism cradled in religion. Since 1977, the religious political parties have played important role in shaping the role of religion in Bangladesh’s politics. The political discourse of religious political parties has helped smaller religious groups to grow and at times with their patronage but providing it with radical spin that gives space to radicalized debate. The Islamic political parties, stigmatized for their role in the liberation war, spread their network especially after 1990 with the restoration of democracy. In the 1980s, the religious political parties were consolidating their organization which was in disarray following the ban on them. Jamaat Islami was the most prominent party. However, other Islamic parties like the Muslim League and Nizam-e-Mushtafa were politically present. After the 1979 Iranian revolution, the Ulemma tried to play a politically more visible role by floating parties like Khilafat Andolan and later in 1990 Islami Shansontantra Andolan. Jihad became a catch-word against oppression and tyranny and was posed as the most successful instrument, particularly after the disintegration of the erstwhile Soviet Union. And the religious political parties in Bangladesh could not remain immune to this call for jihad as some of these religious parties helped in dispatching jihadis to fight in Afghanistan. The ultra-radical Taliban regime in Afghanistan and their politico-religious success epitomized the ideal of a state governed by Shariat - a prospect of prototype Iran. It needs to be mentioned that some of the Jamaat leaders had played an important role in training and indoctrinating Bangladeshis who were willing to fight in Afghanistan. Some of the trained Mujahideen returned in 1990 and vowed to turn Bangladesh into Afghanistan by becoming the Bangladeshi Taliban. The social and political bases for resurgence of radical Islam had already been germinated during long period of military rule which patronized the religious political parties and co-opted them. Therefore, the confirmation of the existence of various Islamic groups was matter of time. Organizations like Harkat-ul-Jihadi-Islam (HuJI) were created by these Afghan-returned warriors also known as Bangladeshi Taliban. In 1998, its leader Fazlur Rahman along with Osama bin Laden signed a document declaring “holy war” against the USA. Other organizations like the Ahl-e-Hadith Andolan Bangladesh (AHAB), which professes Wahhabi ideology, spread its network through generous funding from the Middle Eastern countries and later the Jamaat-ulMujaheedin Bangladesh (JMB) also spread its network in Bangladesh. Though HuJI has a transnational network and is aligned to various other groups in India and is fighting with a pan-Islamic agenda, groups like the AHAB and JMB are more focused on Bangladesh and want Bangladesh, which is a Muslim majority country, to be ruled by Shariat. The JMB earlier had come into media attention in 2003 when some of its members were arrested in Chittagong while undergoing training. However, the government had ignored the report and later these people were freed as the police failed to produce any evidence against them. The spread and network of JMB was evident when this obscure organization orchestrated 459 bomb blasts across 63 districts out of 64 in a matter of half an hour on 17 August 2005. The subsequent suicide killings, first of their kind in Bangladesh, attested to the dangers of Islamist militancy in Bangladesh. Institutional affiliation of these groups to Middle East based Islamic NGOs reveals its extra-regional linkages. Repeated denial by the government and its extreme reluctance to take action against these groups in spite of media reports helped the extremist elements to strengthen their network. For example, in 2004, the media also reported Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB) that was involved in vigilante activities against the sarboharas with the patronage of the ruling parties and the government rejected these reports outright. The Jamaat and Islami Oikya Jote’s (IOJ) presence in the government as alliance partner helped the Islamists, as it deterred any action against them. To deal with the media criticism at one point in time, the government went to the extent of saying that the reports on extremism were a media creation and were meant to tarnish the image of Bangladesh and undermine the efforts of the BNP-led alliance government to promote good governance. Political rhetoric blaming one party or the other for militancy limited the scope of further enquiry. The politically motivated bureaucracy - divided along party lines with strong ideological afinity - further eroded the chance of any further investigation on this matter and the matter remained in limbo. The police force helped the JMJB operations against the radical left and the administrative machinery provided full support to the militants by providing logistical support to the meetings addressed by Bangla Bhai. The police claimed that the JMJB was helping them in maintaining law and order, which is a poor reflection on the state of affiairs of the law-enforcing apparatus. This nexus with the BNP government further emboldened the Islamists. The government, dependent on donors, did not wish its image of a “moderate Muslim” country to be tarnished. It accused India of playing an aggressive role along with the Awami League to prove Bangladesh a failed state without going into the causes of militancy and its links with some of the Cabinet Ministers.1 Another problem was the emergence of a shadow government under the active patronage and support of Tarique Rahman, son of former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia. These young generations of politicians supported the BNP’s alliance with the Jamaat for sheer electoral calculations. In spite of their reported linkages with radical elements Tarique Rahman and his young coterie were reluctant to part ways with them, thus creating a division within the BNP. Moreover, Jamaat’s ascendancy to power and BNP’s dependency on it for political survival strengthened the power of the religious right. This chapter examines the factors that helped in the rise of Islamist militancy, the organizational structure of the militant groups, their network and transnational linkages. It also analyses the future of radical Islam in Bangladesh in the context of global war on terror and growth of radical Islam in general. © 2011 K. Warikoo.

N2  - In the US, where registration of lobbyists is mandatory, the pharmaceutical industry and private health-care providers spend huge amounts of money seeking to influence health policies and government decisions. In Brazil, where lobbying lacks transparency, there is virtually no data on drug industry expenditure to persuade legislators and government officials of their viewpoints and to influence decision-making according to commercial interests. Since 1990, however, the Associação da Indústria Farmacêutica de Pesquisa (Interfarma - Pharmaceutical Research Industry Association), Brazilian counterpart of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), main lobbying organization of the US pharmaceutical industry, has played a major role in the advocacy of interests of major drug companies. The main goals of Interfarma lobbying activities are: shortening the average time taken by the Brazilian regulatory agency (ANVISA) to approve marketing authorization for a new drug; making the criteria for incorporation of new drugs into SUS (Brazilian Unified Health System) more flexible and speeding up technology incorporation; changing the Country's ethical clearance system and the ethical requirements for clinical trials to meet the need of the innovative drug industry, and establishing a National Policy for Rare Diseases that allows a prompt incorporation of orphan drugs into SUS. Although lobbying affects community health and well-being, this topic is not in the public health research agenda. The impacts of pharmaceutical lobbying on health policies and health-care costs are of great importance for SUS and deserve to be investigated.

N2  - The process of creating and issuing internationally accepted accounting standards is usually long-lasting and complex process. Accounting standards which are most widely applied are International Financial Reporting Standards and US Generally Accepted Accounting Standards. Those two sets of standards converge since 2002 when Norwalk agreement between the IASB and the FASB has been signed. Those standard setters acknowledged their commitment to develop high quality and comparable accounting standards that could be used both for domestic and cross border financial reporting. As a result of this co-operation, a new common revenue standard was issued. This standard should increase the comparability of financial statements for companies operating in the same industry and also for the companies applying different accounting standards - US GAAPs and IFRSs. The International Accounting Standards Board follows rigorous open due standard setting process which includes the publication of all relevant documents in standard setting process on its website. The public is invited to take part in standard setting process by sending comment letters on documents published on the IASB's official website. Prior to issuing a new standard, the IASB issued Exposure draft and different interest groups sent comment letters to the IASB to point the potential shortcomings in a standard and potential problems in its practical implementation. This paper analyses the procedure of issuing a new standard on revenues (IFRS 15 - Revenues from Contracts with Customers). The purpose of this paper was to identify the most important interest groups that influenced the content of IFRS 15 by sending comment letters on proposed exposure drafts. In order to make relevant conclusions, all publicly available documents related to comment letters received from public on initial and revised exposure draft have been analysed. The research has shown that the most comment letters on new revenue standard has been received from the preparers of financial statements and from accounting professionals, namely accountants, auditors, accounting firms and organizations. We noticed that non-accounting organizations and associations at the national and international levels are also interested in the content and application of new accounting standard on revenues. Regulators at national and international level and national standard setters were also involved in due standard setter process. The smallest number of comment letters was received from academics and financial statement users. Copyright © 2018 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).

N2  - This study aims to determine the views of police officers and police candidates regarding professionally unethical behaviors of police officers as observed by the former. For this purpose, a descriptive study model was employed in this research. The study group comprised 89 police officers and 231 police candidates working/studying at Malatya and Elazig Police Vocational Colleges. The related research data was collected using an ``Unethical Behavior Scale{''} developed by the researcher. In the analysis of obtained data, descriptive statistics and t-test were used and the quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS software program. The results of the study can be summarized as follows: in the context of the overall arithmetic mean of the police officers, they believe that their colleagues ``Never{''} perform any professionally unethical behavior. According to the police officers in this study, the most unethical behavior performed by their colleagues is ``using bilateral relations for improper appointment,{''} while the least unethical behavior is ``accepting a bribe while conducting his duty.{''} However, the police candidates in this study generally think that police officers ``very rarely{''} perform professionally unethical behaviors. Police candidates also considered ``using bilateral relations for improper appointment{''} as the most unethical behavior performed by police officers and ``accepting a bribe while conducting his duty{''} as the least unethical behavior. Although the views of the participants remained unchanged in terms of the school variable, they differed according to the job variable. Based on the findings, it is suggested that training programs should prepare police officers and candidates in their pre-service and in-service training to help them become more sensitive to professional ethics and principles, and the necessary precautions and controls that need to be taken on this issue.

N2  - What happens when local governments hire lobbyists? Although intergovernmental lobbying is common in the United States and other federal systems, we know little about its consequences. Using newly compiled data on state-level lobbying across the country, I establish a positive correlation between city lobbying and state funding. I then introduce over a decade of panel data onmunicipal lobbying in California to estimate the returns to lobbying for cities with a difference-indifferences design. I show that lobbying increases state transfers to cities by around 8%. But the benefits of intergovernmental lobbying are not equally distributed. I find that cities with higher levels of own-source revenue per capita net more statemoney when they hire lobbyists, despite enjoying a local revenue advantage. These results offer some of the first empirical evidence that city officials can influence state spending by lobbying—but this behavior may also perpetuate local economic inequality. © 2020 by the Southern Political Science Association.

N2  - Why do local governments sometimes hire lobbyists to represent them in other levels of government? I argue that such mobilization efforts depend in part on the policy congruence between localities and their elected delegates in the legislature. I provide evidence consistent with this theory by examining how municipal governments in the United States respond to partisan and ideological mismatches with their state legislators - a common representational challenge. Using almost a decade of original panel data on municipal lobbying in all 50 states, I employ difference-in-differences and a regression discontinuity design to demonstrate that cities are significantly more likely to hire lobbyists when their districts elect non-co-partisan state representatives. The results are broadly consistent with a model of intergovernmental mobilization in which local officials purchase advocacy to compensate for the preference gaps that sometimes emerge in multilevel government.

N2  - Zero tolerance towards corruption and related disclosure of irregularities is more frequently a subject of discussions than serious attempts to determine its magnitude in state administration. Consequently, a survey was conducted among civil servants on the perception of corruption based on the model of Transparency International. Civil servants, as drafters of legislation and especially as (in)direct participants in the exercise of public power, more frequently detect irregularities, as they are reported by the media, or are perceived through a system-oriented work in this area. In the context of our research, it was found that perception of the general state of corruption in Slovenia is higher than the global average. Slovenian civil servants believe that the government is under the influence of interest groups and that its effectiveness decreases. As the most corrupt, they exposed the political parties, media and the health care system, and the military, NGOs, and police as the least corrupt.

N2  - The settlers constitute a minority group whose goals are becoming increasingly unpopular among Israelis. As a result, the degree of legitimacy granted to them by the government gradually eroded over the years. However, their project still thrives. Their impressive success can be attributed to their focus on the bureaucracy. As early as the 1960s, the settlers engaged in a constant effort to identify actors in state and semi-state agencies that had common interests with them. At first they mobilized supporters from within those agencies. Later they made any effort to fill available positions with their own people. Today, the settlers' movement in Israel has fused itself with the relevant elements within the bureaucracy to a degree that many state agencies serve as extensions of the settler movement.

N2  - This article analyzes prisoners' accounts of human rights violations and protections in two types of prisons in the Dominican Republic: "new" prisons that uphold goals of rights and rehabilitation and "old" prisons that mostly warehouse people. This mixed-methods study finds that prisoners experience significant violence, mostly by other prisoners in old facilities and mostly by corrections staff in new facilities, with different rationales and possible responses. I consider three types of recourse mechanisms: top-down (courts or external commissions), bottom-up (advocacy), and internal institutional (grievance processes and human rights training). I argue that each of these carries constraints, and prisoners perceive official channels to favor the institution. The prevalence of rights violations and the narrow recourse options generate cynicism and frustration among prisoners and their families, which can undermine the legitimacy gained through other important improvements in the reform process.

T1  - The Dynamics of Interventionism: A Case Study of British Land Use Regulation

N2  - Over the last century, governments throughout the established democracies have increasingly sought to regulate land markets via all manner of interventions. Such policies have typically been defended on the 'market failure' grounds of orthodox welfare economics. Absent government action, it is argued, price signals will not be reflective of the relevant opportunity costs, owing to the prevalence of externality and public goods problems in the market for land. The Austrian school of economics has, of course, long been sceptical of such claims. The epistemological case against government planning as originally set out by Mises and Hayek suggests that without a functioning market in public goods planners will lack the necessary information with which to 'get the prices right'. The result of intervention, therefore, is likely to be the creation of shortages and surpluses in the affected markets, which will then lead to demands for further government action in a cycle of progressively worsening intervention. In addition to such failures stemming from the absence of omniscience, scholars in the public choice tradition have pointed to the absence of benevolence as a further source of 'government failure'. Seen from this perspective, government action invariably creates special interest beneficiaries who will be resistant to the repeal of interventionist measures, however, inimical these may be to the general weal. Given the widespread growth of government land use regulation the practical experience of land use planning should provide a useful testing ground to examine the political economy of interventionism. Land use controls should provide a particularly revealing instance of interventionist dynamics because, perhaps more than any other aspect of the regulatory state, attempts to balance competing demands for the use of land have immediate knock on effects in multiple different policy areas. This paper examines the experience of British land use regulation as a case study of interventionism. In doing so it offers a theoretical synthesis of 'Austrian' and public choice approaches and an empirical case with which to explore their relevance. While offering confirmation of the basic framework, the paper highlights the need for further theoretical development in order to account for the growth of land use regulation combined with the apparent retreat of the state in other policy fields. The Dynamics of Interventionism: The classical liberal critique of interventionism posits two central tendencies that are considered inherent to all governmental attempts to control market processes - that intervention will fail to achieve its original objectives and that such failures will get progressively worse over time. There are in turn, two dimensions that underlie the tendency towards 'government failure' in this regard. The first, following the Austrian school, examines the epistemological deficiencies of intervention and the dynamics this sets in train, while the second drawing on elements of public choice theory, highlights the defective incentive structures that the process of intervention creates and tends to solidify. Epistemological Dynamics: The epistemological argument against interventionism is a subspecies of the more general critique of government planning developed by the Austrian school and Mises and Hayek in particular (Mises, 1940; Hayek, 1944). Seen from this perspective, the failure of comprehensive government planning stems from its chronic inability to co-ordinate the multiple plans and actions of different individuals and organisations under conditions of complexity and uncertainty. According to the Austrian school, all human action involves unintended consequences - owing to the cognitive limits of the human mind individuals and groups cannot be aware of all the different ramifications of their actions both to themselves and the wider society at large. The central problem of social co-ordination, therefore, is to enable different individuals and groups to adjust their behaviour to circumstances and interests of which they are not and cannot be fully aware (Hayek, 1948a, b). It is precisely in this vein that the 'spontaneous order' generated by market processes though 'imperfect', shows its superiority over government planning. In an unfettered market economy no exchange will take place unless both parties expect to benefit. In turn, the structure of relative prices that emerges from multiple acts of exchange enables people to calculate which goods are more or less scarce and to adjust their behaviour accordingly. Movements in the relative prices of land, labour and capital encourage consumers to shift from more to less expensive alternatives. Similarly, the signals of profit and loss indicate to producers the relative success of competing production plans in satisfying the requirements of consumers. As Hayek (1948) argues, the price system enables people to adjust their behaviour to the plans of widely dispersed actors by communicating in condensed form the 'circumstances of time and place' including changes in tastes, entrepreneurial innovations and other context-specific factors that can never be comprehended in their entirety. For a government planning mechanism to achieve an equivalent level of co-ordination would require that those in the relevant authority be consciously aware of all the relevant facts necessary to co-ordinate all the components that form a complex economy. It is, however, the cognitive inability of planners to access the myriad changing circumstances affecting the behaviour of individuals and firms that prevents central planning of this type. It is important to emphasise at this juncture that such problems apply equally to 'bottom-up' approaches to 'planning', which advocate pluralist politics as a way of securing adjustment between competing demands as an alternative to 'top-down' bureaucratic control. The information emergent from the interplay of interest groups, politicians and different government agencies is by no means equivalent to that generated from exchange relations in private markets (Wohlgemuth, 1995, 1999). In the latter, the structure of relative prices is constantly updated via the continuous buying and selling decisions of millions of individuals. Pluralist politics, by contrast, is far less continuous in its decision mode with no standard feedback mechanism between 'demanders' (voters and interest groups) and 'suppliers' (politicians and bureaucrats) in the period between elections. Moreover, the vote of someone who values a particular good very highly counts for no more than that of someone else who places the same good much further down her scale of individual values (Steele, 1992). Political actors, therefore, have no common denominator of changing relative scarcities equivalent to money prices and will produce decisions that are not reflective of underlying patterns of supply and demand (Mises, 1920; Hayek, 1948c). The misallocation of resources and the absence of an effective feedback mechanism to correct for such errors will be evidenced in the persistence of shortages and surpluses across the political economy. From an Austrian perspective, policies that attempt to control or steer individual markets in accordance with government determined objectives will be subject to the same epistemological deficiencies as attempts to plan the pattern of production and consumption across the economy as a whole (Mises, 1940; Burton, 1984; Ikeda, 1997). The logic of interventionist politics involved in measures such as price control or product regulation is the imposition by political authorities of terms that would otherwise not be agreed upon by parties to a voluntary exchange. As a consequence, the range of options people are willing to offer one another is reduced and the market no longer communicates the full spectrum of available opportunities for exchange (Holcombe, 2002). The use of force is crucial to an 'Austrian' understanding of interventionism in this regard. Owing to the epistemological problems outlined above the government and those seeking to influence it via the political process cannot be aware of the 'circumstances of time and place' that are known only to those willing to enter a voluntary exchange. The result of coercive intervention in the market economy, therefore, will be unmet demands or unsold supplies in the areas afflicted by government action. A secondary aspect of the Austrian analysis is that interventionist measures will become more widespread over time as governments respond to initial policy failures by seeking a further extension of their powers (Mises, 1940; Burton, 1984; Ikeda, 1997). Because the market economy is a complex network of inter-connected exchanges, the negative effects of intervention in one area will ripple out into related markets and eventually may permeate the entire economic system. Thus, interventions in one area beget interventions elsewhere, in what becomes an increasingly complex web of controls and subsidies across a range of interconnected markets. As interventions spread throughout the economy, co-ordination failures epitomised by shortages and surpluses multiply because the different branches of government are unable to trace the original source of the problems with which they are dealing.

N2  - Prior research suggests that partisanship can influence how legislators learn from each other. However, same-party governments are also more likely to share similar issues, ideological preferences and constituency demands. Establishing a causal link between partisanship and policy learning is difficult. In collaboration with a non-profit organization, this study isolates the role of partisanship in a real policy learning context. As part of a campaign promoting a new policy among local representatives in the United States, the study randomized whether the initiative was endorsed by co-partisans, out-partisans or both parties. The results show that representatives are systematically more interested in the same policy when it is endorsed by co-partisans. Bipartisan initiatives also attract less interest than co-partisan policies, and no more interest than out-partisan policies, even in more competitive districts. Together, the results suggest that ideological considerations cannot fully explain partisan-based learning. The study contributes to scholarship on policy diffusion, legislative signaling and interest group access.

N2  - Flood Early Warning Systems (FEWS) are implemented in many parts of the world, but early warnings do not always translate into an emergency response from all individuals at risk. This article examines challenges such as warning communication and community response capabilities. Literature review, global online survey results, and experiential knowledge helped identify cross-cutting issues such as failure to use participatory approaches involving communities and addressing their concerns in warning, insufficient preparedness and response levels of FEWS, inadequate translation of disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies into action at the community level, lack of DRR knowledge and practices among key stakeholders, insufficient gender and social inclusion in all stages of FEWS, gaps in institutional communication and collaboration, and, finally, technical and financial constraints. The paper also discusses the contribution of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in addressing the identified challenges and eventually strengthening FEWS locally. CSOs were found to act positively at local level challenges and significantly contribute to addressing them through tailored solutions to community concerns. Such solutions include DRR awareness campaigns to educate the communities and key officials; enhanced communication between vulnerable communities and local authorities; transforming reactive community response that relied on government officials to a risk-informed and self-prepared community response; gender inclusion and diversity in various stages of FEWS; and advocacy campaigns to build resilience to disasters. Eventually, policy-based recommendations that can help to root out the challenges discussed in this study are presented.

N2  - From the end of 16th Century, Madrid, as the home of the court and the
main recipient of the landed revenues of the monarchy, aristocracy and
Church, rapidly increased in size and attracted huge migration, thereby
becoming a significant consumption market and financial center. Those
who migrated set up complex social networks as well as hospitals and
brotherhoods for mutual help. One of those, the Congregacion de San
Fermin de los Navarros, linked those coming from Navarre, who held
important positions in commerce, banking and royal bureaucracy through
strong kinship and patronage networks, The building of a new church for
the fraternity shows up the strong economic position of its members.
Several internal debates point out how consistent the reciprocal
relationship was between these brotherhoods and the close but separate
neighborhoods fo the Navarrese and Basque communities in Madrid.

N2  - This article aims to analyze the relationship between the Brazilian government's adoption of a regulatory measure with a strong impact on the population and the opposition by invested interest groups. The methodology involves the analysis of official documents on the enforcement of health warnings on tobacco products sold in Brazil. In parallel, a search was conducted for publicly available tobacco industry documents resulting from lawsuits, with the aim of identifying the industry's reactions to this process. The findings suggest that various government acts were affected by direct interference from the tobacco industry. In some cases the interventions were explicit and in others they were indirect or difficult to identify. In light of the study's theoretical framework, the article provides original information on the Brazilian process that can be useful for government policymakers in the strategic identification of tobacco control policies.

N2  - High level of distrust in political elites accompanied with a strong perception of corruption in Czech Republic has led to an increase of several anti-corruption nongovernmental organisations' activities. About 18 organisations have created in 2013 an open coalition and established a project called “Reconstruction of the State” (Rekonstrukce státu). This project is oriented towards political parties and political elites to lead them to adopt nine anti-corruption legislative proposals. This paper analyses how the project operates in its formal and informal aspects, which communication means are preferred and how the lobbyists interact with the politicians and political parties. Apart from the analysis of publicly available pieces of information from the project's website and official printed materials, semistructured interviews with activists and field research were performed. It can be seen that Reconstruction of the state has been most successful regarding agenda-setting, but in the context of the legislative process, it has to face many obstacles either from legislators themselves or competitors with different goals.

N2  - The Congregational dispute was one of the most violent episodes in the secular clash of the Third Republic. It was mainly settled by the law of 1 July 1901 whose application was entrusted to the Council of State (Conseil d'Etat). The analysis of its general assembly highlights, grounded on the combination of members' positions and biographical data, the confrontation of two camps. Catholic defenders of congregations use ``legal fiction{''} strategies to maintain the existence of religious companies. The Council of State, although subject to a duty of reserve and to an obligation of neutrality, became for a few years a discreet political arena. This politicization is limited by the sense of duty of high civil servants who manage to reconcile the demands of their service with an hidden opposition. This survey stresses some of the features of a Catholic interpretation of the law, which seeks to recognize the spontaneous life of institutions instead of coercing it. It also shows the strategies of an institution to maintain itself in a hostile political context. The Council has found its balance within the new republican institutions by arranging the cohabitation of the new republican law with the law of the preceding political regimes. The Conseil d'Etat was responsible for deciding on the life or death of religious institutions, and organizes its own survival by taking life sparingly and seeking harmony of jurisprudence everywhere.

N2  - The literature defines the role of interest groups and administration officials in the evolution of health care policy but does not acknowledge the impact of Congressional casework or the initial Social Security (OASI) eligibility criteria. There is, as a result, an inadequate appreciation for (1) the extent to which the initial development of federal policy was a function of Congressional delegations pursuing initiatives that would increase the flow of federal dollars their states could use to expand health services or (2) the way in which the regional cleavages created OASI eligibility criteria combined with the South's control of Congressional leadership positions to yield an expansion of health care for indigent people while intentionally delaying the creation of Medicare. This chapter addresses these gaps and provides a more complete picture of the way in which the incremental, unplanned evolution of federal health care policy was the product of using federal resources to diminish the states' fiscal needs and the south's capacity to temporarily control the health care agenda.

N2  - This contribution suggests a republican interpretation of EU citizenship rights based on the following three propositions: first, the more globalisation transforms national into transnational public goods, the more democratic and republican constitutionalism requires to design and implement transnational public goods treaties as democratic law empowering citizens to invoke and enforce precise and unconditional multilevel market regulations and the protection of public goods vis-à-vis multilevel governance institutions. Secondly, as EU law, such as arts 2 and 9-12 TEU, requires EU Institutions and Member States to protect constitutional, representative, participatory and deliberative democracy and limits all internal and external EU powers by fundamental rights and protection of public goods (res publica), EU citizens rightly challenge EU trade, investment and other treaties that privilege interest groups and undermine the constitutional contract of citizens as codified in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Thirdly, just as common market and competition law inside and beyond the EU protect citizen-driven network governance and rights-based vigilance of EU citizens embedded into comprehensive protection of fundamental rights and a “social market economy” (art.3 TEU), EU institutions should respond to the legitimacy and rule-of-law crises in other areas of EU governance by reconnecting EU law with EU citizens as democratic principals of multilevel governance agents. Anti-citizen clauses in EU free trade agreements with non-European countries (such as art.30.6 CETA) and discriminatory arbitration privileges for foreign investors illustrate the authoritarian disconnect of EU bureaucrats from EU citizens; they risk undermining rule of law, constitutional democracy, and the “social market economy” inside the EU.

Important remarks on international bureaucracies
N2  - This article aims at questioning the idea that international organizations (IOs) are depoliticized' by nature. Based on a review of the literature in sociology, political science, and anthropology about IOs, the purpose is to provide an analysis of the dialectic about politicization and depoliticization in IOs. We identify the main processes through which depoliticization is operated by IOs: the use of ethics and norms, the political neutralization of their official rhetoric, and the resorting to multiform expertise as a means of apolitical self-legitimization. We also explore the factors that may explain this tendency to depoliticize: their problematic status in regard to democratic theory, the diplomatic constraints attached to the intergovernmental structure of their managing bodies, and the administrative and cultural constraints that befall IOs' bureaucracies. Finally, we try to go beyond the concept of depoliticization by stressing the consequences of politicization that stem from IOs' resilient political rhetoric and from the ethical norms and expertise produced by IOs. Because IOs cannot totally eliminate political controversy and debates, the idea of international depoliticized governance' as a result of IOs activity should be put into perspective.

N2  - This essay offers a social history of the labor relations established by the English East India Company at its Blackwall Dockyard in East London from 1615-45. It uses all of the relevant evidence from the company's minute books and printed bylaws and from petitions to the company to assemble a full account of the relationships formed between skilled and unskilled workers, managers, and company officials. Challenging other historians' depictions of early modern dockyards as sites for class confrontation, this essay offers a more agile account of the hierarchies within the yard to suggest how and why the workforce used its considerable power to challenge management and when and why it was successful in doing so. Overall, the essay suggests that the East India Company developed and prioritized a broader social constituency around the dockyard over particular labor lobbies to preempt accusations that it abdicated its social responsibilities. In this way, the company reconciled the competing interests of profit (as a joint stock company with investors) and social responsibility by, to some extent, assuming the social role of its progenitor organizations-the livery company and the borough corporation.

N2  - Conventional accounts of Marbury v. Madison portray Chief Justice Marshall as having contrived the conflict that set the stage for his famous exegesis on judicial review. This Article collects an array of evidence that provides surprisingly strong support for Marshall's supposedly contrived conclusions as to the freestanding nature of mandamus, the meaning of the judiciary Art of 1789, and the requirements of Article III. Such evidence not only calls for a reevaluation of Marbury and its legacy, but also suggests that Marshall may have deliberately obscured the special supervisory role that the Supreme Court may have been expected to play in relation to inferior courts and officers. Marshall's account may have even influenced the official depiction of the mandamus power, resulting in post-Marbury versions of the statute that differ from the one he likely relied upon in 1803.

N2  - In addition to his judicial duties, the Chief Justice presides over a sprawling judicial bureaucracy. Each year, the Chief fills positions within that bureaucracy, designating Article III judges to various specialty courts and appointing such officers as the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Although critics worry that the Chief may use his appointment role to shape Third Branch policy unduly, scholars view the role as constitutionally benign. This Article questions the Chief's role. The Constitution authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of inferior officers in the "courts of law" but not the Chief Justice. History teaches that this was a deliberate choice (to curtail the corrupting influence of patronage powers) and one to which the nation's first Chief, John Jay, scrupulously adhered. After tracing the decline of the early practice, the Article proposes the return to a court-based appointment model.

N2  - New and restrictive regulations were imposed on the deposit financial intermediaries in the 1930s. Whatever the original rationale for those regulatory constraints, considerable sentiment for change developed among academicians, many regulators, and a number of executives of depository financial institutions during the 1960s. During the period of discussions and decisions leading to the recommendations, the senior staff of the commission kept Treasury Department officials informed of the direction the commission members seemed to be taking. As is well known, the commercial banking industry is composed of some 14,000 separately chartered banks. Legislative lobbying by the industry is conducted by a number of associations of which three are the most important. The first is the American Bankers Associations (ABA), which has virtually all banks as members. Second, there is the Independent Bankers Association of America (IBAA) whose main membership and constituency is with the smaller, unit banks.

N2  - The international tax system developed as a form of technocratic governance, aimed at facilitating international investment, neglecting provisions for cooperation between national governments for tax enforcement. Its endogenous flaws resulted in its politicization in the 1970s, and again in the 1990s, leading to an increasingly technicized form of global governance. The great financial crisis was even more disruptive and accelerated a shift toward increasingly volatile interactions between the spheres of technocracy and politics. Complex global problems requiring long time-horizons are dealt with by increasingly narrowly focused technical specialists, dominated by corporatized bureaucracies operating in public-private symbiosis; while in the sphere of politics, a wider public seeks simple solutions and mistrusts experts, with good reason given the experience of regulatory failures, often due to the capture of regulation by private interests. Instant communication favors opinion-formers claiming authority, while representative democracy has shifted to ``audience representation,{''} opening the way for demagogue leaders, as well as clientelism and corruption. While the financial crisis opened up possibilities for a paradigm shift in international tax governance, the tensions in both the technocratic and political spheres, as well as the growing gap between them, make it hard to achieve a stable and effective outcome.

N2  - Civil service organizations in the developing world often lack women and minorities in leadership positions. This has important consequences for the quality of public goods provision and the perceived trustworthiness of bureaucrats. We explore the effect of democratization on the discrimination of women and minorities in the civil service. We argue democratization leads to increased discrimination due to the politicization of identity cleavages. We test our argument using administrative data from Indonesia that cover the career histories of more than four million active civil servants. We exploit the exogenous timing of Indonesia's democratization and the staggered introduction of local direct elections for identification purposes. We find strong evidence that democratization worsened the career prospects of female and some religious minority bureaucrats. Penalties are higher for employees of departments led by conservative Muslim parties, in districts with larger Muslim party vote shares or larger Muslim populations, and in the religiously conservative province of Aceh.

N2  - Physical activity is increasingly being defined as a major, complex, multi-sector issue. In order to understand more about how this expanded conception of physical activity is being factored into public policy, this article applies the multiple streams theory of policy change to examine the United Kingdom (UK) physical activity domain. Participant observation, policy analysis and media analysis are combined to examine the ways in which the political context, problem framing and policy solutions were brought together by a range of policy entrepreneurs. The study pays particular attention to how one lobby effort in the UK, the All Party Committee on Physical Activity (APCPA) attempted to elevate physical activity to a higher level of importance. The findings show how a hybrid form of organisation made up of traditional interest groups, corporations and government insiders, has successfully decreased ambiguity about physical activity and increased both official and public attention about the issue. The article suggests that while the multifarious benefits of physical activity and the diverse range of organisations involved have contributed to momentum towards policy change, these factors may also inhibit physical activity from remaining high on the policy agenda. Suggestions are offered for policy practices at a national level.

N2  - In this paper, we argue that a consortium of NGOs has played a significant role in shaping the market for, and restricting the use of, biofuels as an alternative to conventional fuels for road transport in Europe. This paper considers why a number of NGOs (Greenpeace, Oxfam, WWF, RSPB, Friends of the Earth) have chosen to enter the biofuels debate, and how they have variously developed policy, agreed a political campaign, and exercised political influence, in a key area of the world's response to major global climate change: how to reduce the carbon footprint of transport. We found that in many cases the development of NGO policy has been driven more by narrow political opportunities for influence than by broader and more coherent policy responses to global climate change or economic development, or indeed rigorous assessment of the scientific evidence. The research provides evidence of how NGO policies and lobbying significantly affected biofuel policy changes, review processes, target reductions, and sustainability regulation in the UK and in Europe. We consider that politically instituted markets, such as the one for biofuels, are examples of the emergence of new forms of governance of capitalist political economies facing a novel and pressing combination of drivers (climate change, energy security, resource constraints, and sustainable land-use). Politically instituted markets open up possibilities for political intervention from non-governmental or party-political actors, in ways that other markets do not. If political shaping of markets by NGOs becomes more widespread, issues of democratic legitimacy and public scrutiny will become ever more pressing. The paper is based on in-depth interviews with senior scientific directors and policy-makers in five NGOs, and of senior officials in UK government departments and the European Commission (DG Environment and DG Transport and Energy). It forms part of a wider ESRC research project in Brazil, the USA and Europe on the Transition to Sustainable Bioeconomies.

N2  - Introduction France has undergone important changes over the past two decades. But these changes are far from being unambiguous. In 1987, Yves Mény insisted that, despite being commonly considered as “the prototype of centralization” (1987: 88), the French system of relations between centre and periphery has always been more complex than commonly thought. Two aspects were particularly underscored: first, the strong presence of the “local” at the central level and the persistence of “localist” values in the French political culture; and second, the ability of local actors to tame central influence in daily negotiations on public policy implementation (Grémion 1976). Socio-historical researches (Politix 2001) have shown that the birth of the republican regime in late-nineteenth-century France did not simply involve the imposition of new rules by the centre on peripheries. Rather, the consolidation of the regime was the result of the colonisation of the centre by local republican “notables” and “petites patries” (Chanet 1996), with the commune seen as the cradle of republican values. The later reinforcement of the central state and of ministerial bureaucracies, especially with the creation of the Fifth Republic in 1958, never really marginalised local actors in central and local policy-making processes (Tarrow 1977). Paradoxically, the impression of a strong centralisation was also due to the Jacobinism of local politicians, and especially of mayors, who considered the local interest a mere reflection of the general interest defined centrally (Borraz 1998), which they helped forge thanks to the multiple officeholding system. But these same politicians who helped reinforce central state legitimacy were also actively trying to preserve local interests. Thus, the functioning of the French local political system was so far from the stereotype of a highly centralised country that the relevance of the centreperiphery framework was increasingly questioned even before the Decentralisation Acts of the early 1980s. Recent developments allow ambiguity to persist. It is tempting to suggest that two waves of decentralisation (1982-1983 and 2004), the assault of globalisation and EU institutionalisation on the central state, and the localisation of economic interactions (Balme 1996) have definitively made the local government level the more vivid, legitimate, efficient and influential scale of government, along with the regions, at the expense of départements and the central national state. The actual situation is more complicated, for three main reasons. First, the fate of the different levels constituting the three-tier system of French local government (communes, départements, regions) is determined both by deep economic and social change, and - perhaps mainly - by political inflexions and strategies at the central level (Pinson and Le Galès 2005). From this perspective, the French central state’s strategy for territorial reorganisation and decentralisation has fluctuated considerably during the past two decades, owing to political and ideological change or to opportunistic considerations. Second, the trend of territorial reorganisation is unclear, because in a three-tier system in which none of the three components exerts a form of tutelage over the others, each tier is tempted to play its own cards in the reorganisation process, which is a competitive game with uncertain outcomes and which potentially differs from one local or regional situation to another. Outcomes are even more uncertain when the central state’s “favourites” change from one election to another. Twenty-five years after the first Decentralisation Acts, it is no easier to say which level has won the great game of political authority redistribution than it was in 1987 (Fontaine 2007; Zeller 2006). Third, this great difference in the balance between different levels of local or regional bodies is reinforced by the fact that at each individual level, and particularly at the municipal level, the past two decades reveal a powerful process of internal differentiation. There have always been differences between a small rural commune with a population of less than 100 and one with a million inhabitants, despite the fact that French law makes no distinction between them. But there were also similarities. In both cases the capacity to address problems largely depended on access to central government resources, programmes and funds. In both cases the mayor was a key person whose capacity to act was linked to his ability to mobilise political connections to obtain resources. Vertical relationships were more important than horizontal networking, owing to the concentration of resources at the centre. This situation has changed radically, but it still varies considerably between places. In large, thriving cities, a pluralist political landscape has emerged, resources are dispersed and state field services are no longer the dominant actors (Pinson 2006). These pluralist situations require intergovernmental arrangements (Goldsmith 2004), among which inter-municipal institutions are the prominent feature. These arrangements have changed political styles and relationships, helping the rise of a capacity for metropolitan collective action. Elsewhere, in rural areas, in declining medium-sized towns, inter-municipal cooperation is much more difficult, since each individual commune is tempted to put itself under the patronage of a superior tier, the département or the state. Mény (1987: 90) noted that the appearance and deepening of an urban-rural cleavage was one of the clearest features in the evolution of French territorial organisation between 1945 and 1985. By 2007, with the rise of influential collective powers (“pouvoirs d’agglomération”) in big cities, the landscape of communal power had become even more varied and increasingly differentiated. © 2010 Michael J.

N2  - The article reveals the characteristics of think tanks as actors of the interest group politics in the European Union (EU). In this policy, they inspire public debate, conduct research, encourage new legislation and more effective public administration. A large number of European think tanks is engaged in interest group politics both at the national and supranational level of the EU governance, encouraging integration processes among the EU countries and Europeanization, which is the subject of analysis of this study. The strengthening of the role and importance of interest groups in EU policy is largely due to the increased power of the Union’s institutions, since the introduction of new legislation and regulation common to all EU countries leads to the feedback from various groups that represent both public and private interests. Obviously, these groups, when interacting with the power institutions of the EU, strive for the most effective protection of their interests. For this purpose their representatives hold meetings with officials of the European Commission and the European Parliament, as well as other structures of the Union. This interaction, aiming at promoting their interests by means of lobbying and advocacy, has been regulated since 2011 by the Transparency Register, jointly created by the European Commission and the European Parliament. The purpose of this study is to analyze the quantitative performance of think tanks in the EU and to develop on its basis the Ranking of EU countries, according to the level of Europeanization of the think tanks representing them. From the research methods perspective, the study is based on the matching of statistical data from the Transparency Register and the Global Go To Think Tank Index, which serves the basis for this Ranking. The study of the ranking makes it possible to identify groups of countries with a high, medium and low level of Europeanization of think tanks in all EU countries as of January 31, 2019. The results revealed on the basis of the analysis demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of the Europeanization process of think tanks in different EU countries.

N2  - The struggle of the Indonesian women’s movement to advocate for pro-women legislation during the period 1998 to 2017 has had significant achievements and lessons to demonstrate. This paper reports on how women’s groups organized themselves for policy advocacy under the Jaringan Kerja Prolegnas Pro Perempuan or JKP3 (the Network for Pro-Women National Legislation Programme) in the Reformation Era. This is based on literature review, observation and participation in various activities conducted by the network and an analysis of field notes and documents. The network faces significant obstacles and challenges from external parties, namely the government, legislators in parliament, and the general public. The obstacles and challenges faced include lack of concern and understanding about gender equality, rejection of pro-women perspectives, certain religious teachings which limit women’s rights or roles, lack of concern on the part of the bureaucracy and the political attitudes of legislators. Meanwhile, the network also faces various significant challenges of the internal dynamics among different groups. These lead us to identify significant lessons about approaches and strategies. The paper ends with discussion and recommendations for further advocacy work and research on pro-women policy advocacy. © 2018, © 2018 Asian Center for Women's Studies, Ewha Womans University.

N2  - In the face of poorly performing bureaucracies, public management specialists and policy experts have been quick to suggest administrative reforms. Yet, since governance lies at the nexus of politics and administration, reforms limited to the administrative dimension are likely to fall short without concomitant political change. This essay argues that in contemporary Latin America, certain political-institutional arrangements or institutional traits are more likely to produce (in)effective governance than others. Specifically, Latin American presidentialism creates several “perils” for governance, including: the rigidity and short time horizons of presidentialism; multipartyism under presidentialism; weakly institutionalized party systems and non-programmatic parties; an imbalance of power between strong presidents and weak legislatures; the plebiscitarian nature of presidentialism; and democratic backsliding and the centralization of power in the presidency. These institutional traits incentivize patronage, promote myopic policymaking, and weaken bureaucratic autonomy. To illustrate how they manifest themselves in public policy, the paper uses evidence from the region’s responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, then concludes by suggesting political reforms that may help to improve governance in the region.

N2  - This paper considers the political economy of tobacco regulation-that is. the interplay between politics and markets in tobacco regulation. In surveying the interest-group politics of tobacco control, it describes political advantages held by a profitable and concentrated industry engaged in tobacco production. It also considers reasons for the Surprising political success of tobacco control advocates over the past decade. The paper considers challenges faced by tobacco control advocates. who face their own obstacles to collective action in promoting effective tobacco regulation. Both public officials and tobacco control advocates face stronger incentives to advocate new legislation than they do to ensure effective implementation of existing regulatory measures. The essay concludes by considering the Master Settlement Agreement., whose detailed implementation remains uncertain after the election of the Bush administration.

N2  - In this study the author explores the connection between good governance and social capital, with a focus on the case of Romania. A new governance arrangements which are helpful in generating change in government means giving up old paradigms and accepting some innovative approaches in which citizens are, at the same time, co-participants in the decision processes regarding the new development of the community they benefit from. Focusing on results expresses the need for the creation of a strategic vision of the expected outcome, vision which takes into consideration, on the one hand, making the best out of the positive influences of external factors, and on the other hand, reducing (eliminating) the threats coming from latter. This construction represents a potential solution based on co-operation between governments (centrally, regionally, and locally), civil society association and other stakeholders such as media and business. There is an urgent demand to make the central and local administration structures more efficient (for them to become compatible with the flexible structure of the meta-organization) and to limit the decision-making capacity of the administrations by involving citizens and interest groups representative for the community in the decision-making process. The conclusion of the study, based on empirical data, is that for now social capital does not represent a support for governance. Even more, we believe that the current situation in Romania leads to the consolidation of authoritarianism and rigid bureaucratic structures. This research focuses on identifying those mechanisms of local governance able to innovation the governance arrangement and building the social capital in a way as for governments to share public responsibilities with all the representative actors of the community (e.g. politicians, bureaucrats, members of community or representatives of the community's interests). In terms of this research, our hypothesis is that governments might well develop their own characteristic culture of innovation, so we are interested in any normative and strategic characteristics that unite the whole government and distinguish them from others. In order to cope with passing from government to governance, the political leaders must show political maturity, both in order to promote changes of the institutional arrangements by involving social capital, and to stimulate its construction. The research was conducted for almost one year and refers to the Romanian public organizations. It is based on a complex methodology that includes both quantitative methods for data collection as well as qualitative methods for processing the statistical outcomes.

N2  - US and European banks, insurance companies, asset managers and other financial services firms have long competed in multiple jurisdictions with distinct and sometimes incompatible regulatory systems. As transatlantic market integration proceeded throughout the 1990s, problems sparked by these regulatory differences were the focus of a host of often intense conflicts. This chapter explains an unexpected shift in the way American and European authorities managed these conflicts: from cooperation skewed heavily towards the preferences of US officials, and accepted grudgingly by European counterparts, to a Euro-American regulatory condominium characterised by close interaction among decision-makers and mutual accommodation. Why did US officials become more accommodating and European authorities more influential, and why did more balanced cooperation begin in 2002–3 in some sub-sectors but only more recently in others? This chapter thus examines change in a core G7 relationship during the 2002–7 ‘period of calm’. My findings highlight the role of political authority, institutions and power in reconfiguring transatlantic regulatory cooperation. Lobbying by financial services companies, in part driven by market forces, also played an important role, ensuring that conflicts were resolved through deeper cooperation. But the preferences and actions of private actors were ultimately contingent on political developments tied to the fifty-year-old European integration project. In emphasising official sector decision-making and political power over private influence in public policy, this chapter parallels the contributions by Helleiner and Pagliari, Walter, and Baker in this volume.

N2  - East Asian countries have implemented around 60 free trade agreements (FTAs), mostly bilateral, to become one of the most active sites of regionalism. The dominant analyses portray these FTAs as driven primarily by foreign policy motivations and promoted by political leaders with businesses marginally involved or interested. It is contended here that, compared to other forms of liberalization, bilateral FTA negotiations promote new institutional arrangements within government agencies and business associations and unique configurations of government–business relations. Formulation of FTAs imposes greater information demands on government officials, which should compel them to consult business associations. In turn, clearer identification of FTAs' impacts and greater chances to affect their formulation should increase business incentives to lobby for or against FTA liberalization domestically and across borders. Demands on officials and business associations upon successive FTAs should foster institutional change/creation to reduce information and coordination costs. These hypotheses were tested on the bilateral FTAs of Thailand and Malaysia. FTAs in these countries stimulated government–business consultations and lobbying by businesses that, for some key FTAs, took the initiative. Successive negotiations strengthened the technical capacities of officials and business associations and stimulated the emergence of new institutions, which may endure to provide similar functions for multilateral rounds. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Two characteristics of interest group structure are considered. First, when one united lobby represents fishermen, the industry controls the policy agenda and resists providing information required for efficient regulation. In contrast, industries made up of rival sectors offer competing policy proposals with supporting biological, economic and legal information. Second, groups suffering from collective action problems cannot successfully appeal to elected officials to overturn decisions by the agency managing resources. The two variables of coalition structure and the strength of groups within alliances combine into a fourfold typology that suggests the behavior of groups, elected officials and bureaus in the fishery management as well as their ability to prevent stock decline.

N2  - The first decade of reforms (1986-1996) in Uganda following the coming into power of the present National Resistance Movement (NRM) government under President Yoweri Museveni in 1986 is hailed as the most successful. This was a period when security was re-established in most of the country, government bureaucracy reformed and basic public services re-instated (at least, in urban areas). Out of the three priorities, the NRM government succeeded most in re-establishing security and in particular securing the monopoly of state on violence. However, Uganda’s reality demonstrates two conflicting narratives about the government’s performance over the past 30 years: “Uganda as a success” and “Uganda in crisis”. The continued tension between the state bureaucracy, supposedly apolitical and meritocratic, and the patronage-based political establishment gnaws at public sector efficiency. In the absence of strong national commitment and a clear strategic direction, the public sector reform agenda is likely to continue to be driven by donors, lack coherence and deliver mixed results.

N2  - Although a long tradition of research shows that the correlation between economic growth and well-being is imperfect, the sociology of development continues to focus on economic growth. In this paper we take a first step toward a sociology of social development by defining which indicators other than economic growth best capture different facets of citizen well-being, theorizing what social phenomena explain the variance in these indicators, and specifying causal mechanisms that connect the two. We show quantitatively that one main predictor of social development is basic sanitation, and that a key correlate of poor sanitation is corruption in law enforcement. We use direct measures of experiences with corruption, rather than subjective measures of perceptions of corruption. We then draw on qualitative data to suggest why and how corruption in the judiciary enables poor sanitation. Where the state does not efficiently deliver municipal services, intermediaries facilitate illegal access to services, and can only perform their work if law enforcement can be bribed. But by providing access to some citizens and not all, these intermediaries fragment citizens' interests. Politics develops around lines of patronage rather than programmatic policies, and those who do not have the material resources to bypass the poor municipal systems, or the political resources to participate in patronage, are left without access to basic sanitation.

N2  - In retrospect it is difficult to accept that Western democracies have implicitly supported, or at least tolerated, the legalized system of white supremacy in South Africa known as apartheid. Renate Pratt's new book, In Good Faith, explains why the Christian churches were among the first to publicly protest, and why they provided such cogent and determined international support for the struggle against apartheid. The Taskforce on the Churches and Corporate Responsibility is a coalition of Christian churches that for nearly twenty years was one of Canada's leading anti-apartheid advocates. As the first co-ordinator of this Taskforce, Renate Pratt was at the centre of the early anti-apartheid initiatives in Canada and consequently is able to supply a clear and accurate view. The book traces the history of exchanges between the Taskforce and successive ministers and senior civil servants of the Department of External Affairs. It details the reluctant and weak responses offered by the Canadian government and business community right up to the time of Nelson Mandela's release from prison. In Good Faith will be of particular interest to Canadian Christians concerned with ecumenical co-operation and with the social and political dimensions of their faith. Equally, it will appeal to those interested in the impact of public interest organizations on public policy or the relationship between politics and business interests. © 1997 Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion.

N2  - The Supreme Court’s “weaponized” First Amendment has been its strongest antiregulatory tool in recent decades, slashing campaign-finance regulation, public-sector union financing, and pharmaceutical regulation, and threatening a broader remit. Along with others, I have previously criticized these developments as a “new Lochnerism.” In this Essay, part of a Columbia Law Review Symposium, I press beyond these criticisms to diagnose the ideological outlook of these opinions and to propose an alternative. The leading decisions of the antiregulatory First Amendment often associate free speech with a vision of market efficiency; but, I argue, closer to their heart is antistatist fear of entrenchment by elected officials, interest groups, and bureaucrats. These opinions limit the power of government to implement distributional judgments in key areas of policy and, by thus tying the government’s hands, constrain opportunities for entrenchment. This antidistributive deployment of market-protecting policy is the signature of neoliberal jurisprudence. But this jurisprudence has deep problems in an order of capitalist democracy such as ours. Whenever the state cannot implement distributional judgments, markets will do so instead. Market distributions are, empirically speaking, highly unequal, and these inequalities produce their own kind of entrenchment—class entrenchment for the wealthy. A jurisprudence that aims at government neutrality by tying the distributional hands of the state cannot achieve neutrality but instead implicitly sides with market inequality over distinctively democratic forms of equality. Once we see that any constitutional vision involves some relationship between the “democratic” and the “capitalist” parts of capitalist democracy, it becomes possible not just to criticize the Court’s siding with market winners but also to ask what kinds of equality-pursuing policies the Constitution must permit to reset that balance in favor of democracy.

N2  - Background: Identifying unsafe abortion among the major causes of maternal deaths and respecting the rights to health of women, in 2002, the Nepali parliament liberalized abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy on request. However, enhancing women's awareness on and access to safe and legal abortion services, particularly in rural areas, remains a challenge in Nepal despite a decade of the initiation of safe abortion services. Methods: Between January 2011 and December 2012, an operations research study was carried out using quasi-experimental design to determine the effectiveness of engaging female community health volunteers, auxiliary nurse midwives, and nurses to provide medical abortion services from outreach health facilities to increase the accessibility and acceptability of women to medical abortion. This paper describes key components of the operations research study, key research findings, and follow-up actions that contributed to create a conducive environment and evidence in scaling up medical abortion services in rural areas of Nepal. Results: It was found that careful planning and implementation, continuous advocacy, and engagement of key stakeholders, including key government officials, from the planning stage of study is not only crucial for successful completion of the project but also instrumental for translating research results into action and policy change. While challenges remained at different levels, medical abortion services delivered by nurses and auxiliary nurse midwives working at rural outreach health facilities without oversight of physicians was perceived to be accessible, effective, and of good quality by the service providers and the women who received medical abortion services from these rural health facilities. Conclusions: This research provided further evidence and a road-map for expanding medical abortion services to rural areas by mid-level service providers in minimum clinical settings without the oversight of physicians, thus reducing complications and deaths due to unsafe abortion.

N2  - Graduated control models are often used to explain the variety of government treatment of social organizations in China. These models have been slowly losing their explanatory power in recent years, with advocacy-oriented grass-roots groups participating in the policymaking process. Why are these social groups not regulated in the way the graduated control models predict? Based on an analysis of three recent policy advocacy cases, this article proposes a graduated control 2.0 model to explain the new dynamics in Chinese state-society interactions. The upgraded model argues that the government officials' behaviour patterns are influenced by numerous factors such as the inherent nature of social groups highlighted by graduated control models, and inter-ministerial competition - the power position of the state sector and its rival sector in the bureaucratic system. Some contingent factors also play a part, such as timing and the NGO's onstage performance. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion on Chinese state-society relations by developing a theoretical model that highlights both the fragmentation and reactiveness of state control over social groups and further unpacks the 'monolithic state' in China studies.

N2  - This article investigates patronage in the Second Italian Republic by considering patronage a fundamental device able to guarantee a party presence in the governance of public bodies. The study sheds light on a particular area of party patronage, namely political appointments concerning legislators; it analyzes the factors which could determine whether a member of Parliament will be appointed to a state-owned enterprise’s board of directors after a legislature, seeking to gain a better understanding of how political actors exploit this opportunity. Direct political connections can be conceptualized as instruments to control and reward politicians and/or strategies to enhance political control over the bureaucracy. The empirical investigation suggests that legislators’ efforts in Parliament play a role in the likelihood of patronage appointments. Education does not seem to significantly increase the probability of receiving a nomination for a seat on public firms’ boards, moreover our result casts doubt on the merits or competencies of the appointed politicians.

N2  - Voluntary sector and non-profit studies require theoretical frameworks facilitating better understandings of what occurs on the ground. Following Lipsky's (Street-level bureaucracy: dilemmas of the individual in public service, Russell Sage Foundation, New York, 1980) formulation of street-level bureaucracies, scholars have emphasized workplace hierarchies, reproducing dichotomous 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' conceptualizations of practice which can obscure the full complexity of practitioners' workplace relationships. In this paper, we offer a thematic model of (collective) action that centres the 'division of labour' across, and relations between, professional niches that are differentiated by their 'helping' orientations, workplace tasks, and responsibilities to service users rather than their organizational status or salaries. We mobilize qualitative research undertaken in the penal voluntary sectors of Canada and England to highlight the mutually constitutive efforts of frontline and management work with criminalized service users. Drawing on and extending Alinsky's 'river dilemma', we conceptualize practice in the (penal) voluntary sector as organized according to the differing choices practitioners make about whom to 'help' and how to intervene, which have consequences for social policy, service delivery, and advocacy work.

N2  - In domestic affairs, the administration sought to extend poliey controls over administrative agencies by requiring eost-benefit analyses supervised by the Office of Management and Budget. The President also issued directives requiring more than two million government employees to sign secrecy agreements, a pro gram undertaken in the absence of any explicit statutory authority. Finally, the administration bitterly opposed congressional measures that it believed infringed upon executive prerogatives-such as the legislative veto, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget control legislation, and provisions for the appointment of independent counsel to investigate alleged crimes of high executive officers.

N2  - Cycles of bureaucratic corruption in nineteenth-century Cuba evolved according to institutional conditions shaped by interest groups, financial needs, imperatives of colonial governance, and internal conflicts and war. Corrupt gain inimical to general public interest was not a consequence of cultural constants, but of unreconstructed institutional flaws and weaknesses. The risks of engaging in bureaucratic corruption diminished under the systematic condoning of administrative faults, collusive allowance of illegal slave trafficking, and a code of illegal rewards expected by loyalist officials opposing colonial reform. Despite some few anti-corruption initiatives, the prosecution and punishment of corrupt officials was lax. The implicit, yet significant, financial, institutional and political costs of corruption contributed to the demise of Spanish imperial dominion over Cuba and left a damaging burden and legacy for Cuban civil society.

Some of these doubts relate to the governance process itself. © 2007 Sage Publications.

N2  - The mobilisation of French Appeal Court Attorneys followed the Attali and Darrois commissions in 2007, which were appointed to prepare the ``modernisation{''} of the French legal institutions. This included proposals to cut their monopoly on the second instance jurisdictions, which would bring about the demise of their profession. In 2008, the Minister for Justice in the government of Francois Fillon announced a bill which endorsed this proposal, presenting it as ``progressive{''} and in the interests of those subjected to legal proceedings. As for the previous laws targeting other ministerial officers, this bill did not excite a great deal of media and political attention. This is down to a certain political consensus between, on the one hand, left-wing parties which consider the access to this profession anti-democratic, due to its being very often inherited and conditioned by a system of limited numbers, and on the other hand, an entrepreneurial et economically liberal right-wing looking to open the market of legal cases to competition. The ministerial officers, however, have mobilised for almost two years in opposition to this bill. Their major claim is for the maintenance of their status of protectors separated from the more competitive spaces of the legal and judiciary services. Faced with a cause that seems to be ignored, this article aims to show the social and political conditions of the mobilisation initiated by the attorneys and to understand how the means of action used permitted, despite the ups and downs of the protest movement, to maintain the professional group and its mobilisation... at least until the Government's decision to phase out the profession.

By analysing the fatwas and official statements issued by Russian Muslim leaders between March and May 2020, I identify their discursive strategy of ‘interpret-ing’ the language of bureaucracy and medical terminology into the language of Islam, and of providing theological justification for certain governmental decisions. I consider several cases which illustrate the intervention of political and medical discourses of corporality into religious discourse. These include the politicisation of the regulatory functioning of the body, the sacralisation of quarantine as a special time for spiritual activities, the formatting of funer-ary ritual according to medico-administrative regulations and the comparing of victory in the Great Patriotic War to the victory over COVID-19.

N2  - Bureaucracy is an integral part of modern democratic polity. The modern democratic states are built upon the bureaucratic structure that undergrid these states, although there is a vast difference in bureaucratic traditions and cultures in between developed and developing democratic and democratizing societies. As a developing region, South Asia has a longstanding tradition of bureaucratic organization. The traditional bureaucracies were “patrimonial” in nature, where loyalty was valued more than professionalism. However, the replacement of the concept of modern “rational-legal” bureaucracy in traditional societies like South Asia was initiated by the colonial master rulers or imperial powers following the conceptualization of modern bureaucracy by Max Weber. Their (colonial rulers) intention was to establish a “steel frame” of administration in South Asia so that their hegemony remains intact even after the breakdown of colonial hegemony. Studies of democratic politics in India, the military dominated authoritarian state of Pakistan and the newly democratic state of Bangladesh have addressed this heavily in the literature of politics and administration, but far less explained the process of governance, particularly explaining the politicization of the bureaucracy in South Asia. The role of bureaucracy in governance is not a new phenomenon in the discourse of politics and administration. Irrespective of the regions and the systems of government, professional mandarins or bureaucracies (rational-legal, neutral and merit-based) are exceedingly involved in the process of governance and development, and immensely contribute to the development by serving as advisers, inventors, and decision-makers along with the elected politicians as the agent of change. Thus, a study has been carried out on the politics-bureaucracy relationship and the role of bureaucracy in governance. Yet, academics are interested to understand the nature of the relationship between politics and bureaucracy, their transition, and their mutual interaction in politics from different perspectives and academic point of view with intellectual inquiry. This monograph is with the South Asian bureaucracy, focusing on the light of politicization.

N2  - A remarkable research program exists conceptualizing policy change as dependent variable, and inquiring on factors causing it. A question so far neglected by political science is: to which extent does policy change as independent variable also lead to power changes among key policy actors so they can facilitate and flank those changes? Before this background this study aims to analyze the consequences of 25 years of policy changes on the power of the main bureaucratic actors in a particular policy field. Conceptually we draw on bureaucratic politics, power and relative gains theories and the concept of substantial vs. symbolic policy change. Empirically we focus on all substantive as well as symbolic policy changes within the forest policy sector in Bangladesh between 1989 and 2014. Our finding suggest that over 25 years both, substantive as well as symbolic policy changes bring about power gains for (i) subject-specific sectoral administrations, including multi-sectoral district authorities, who gain power to the largest extent, (ii) cross-cutting general bureaucracies on finance and planning, and (iii) foreign donor administrations. We conclude that esp. sectoral bureaucracies are very sensitive and knowledgeable about the power implications of policy changes specific to their fields of expertise and, hence, are able to follow a more efficient power strategy than their cross-cutting counterparts.

N2  - Bangladesh is widely regarded as a country that is heavily affected by the threats of climate change. In this study, we analyze the management of projects aiming to adapt to climate change in the period from 2009 to 2015. We are interested in two aspects: first, the overall bureaucratic setup of the adaptation regime, and second, the appointment of directors to the individual programs and what role foreign funding plays in making appointment decisions. With regard to the latter, it should be noted that project directors are an important arm of state bureaucracy in Bangladesh who guide the whole implementation and management of a development project, including its financial, regulatory, and informational dimensions. More specifically, we ask whether generalists or professionals are appointed as directors of the relevant projects. We argue and then show that the chances of appointing a professional as the director increase with the volume of foreign funding.

N2  - Multifarious factors have contributed to the development of the private health care sector in Bangladesh. Its growth has been facilitated by the inclusion of private health care development in planning policies, by symbolic encouragement by government officials, by state patronage through medical education and training, by public sector physicians being allowed to practise privately, and by the provision of grants, subsidies and funds for investment. Opportunities for its expansion have also been created by a host of problems in the public health care system, including an inability to provide services, limited resources, poor perception and poor quality of services, a lack of personnel, absenteeism, corruption, and poor planning and management. But complains are also levelled against the private sector, as it lacks necessary infrastructure, equipment and personnel, with poor service conditions, poor quality and poor standards. The government enacted an Ordinance to regulate private health care, but evidence shows that regulatory practices are ineffective as a result of problems of legislative design, information and implementation, as well as internal and external contradictions within the regulatory system. Some policy guidelines are necessary to ensure positive outputs from the private health care sector. © Copyright 2007 Taylor and Francis Group LLC.

N2  - The authors in the article, on the basis of a meta-analysis, theoretical modeling, interpretive method and the method of comparative analysis, seek to describe civil service, as a component of public governance system, and changes of its functional activities. In the beginning of the twenty-first century, the dominant base doctrine became the new public governance, as the product of the evolutionary process of the new public management. Today, its indicators and activities' specifics are extensively discussed. In the content of the article, the authors purposefully seek to accomplish the following tasks: to distinguish the characteristics of the changes in a civil service system and all levels subsystems, decomposition elements of public service structural-functional changes, mechanisms and typology of changes and their management; to emphasize public interest groups and fulfillment of their expectations, as the most important institutional-functional performance targets of civil service. The authors understand and use the functionality of civil service as a characteristic of certain conditions and factors, which connect innovative and creative activities, highlight strategic priorities, balance centralized and decentralized management and improve the implementation of decisions. Discussing the operational efficiency of civil service in the beginning of the twenty-first century, the authors emphasize the increased qualitative requirements of today's civil service system, the tasks for civil servants, which seek to establish new and results-oriented forms of behavior, dissemination of innovative activities and development of inter-organizational networking.

N2  - Citizen trust in public institutions is an indication of successful governance as it has often been viewed as an important element of good governance. Citizen distrust in government and its institutions considerably affects the effectiveness and efficiency of public policies and their implementation. Since the independence, Sri Lanka has been regarded as a third world democracy with a strong welfare state system in which public institutions have played pivotal role in fostering democracy and citizen trust. Nevertheless, in the recent past, citizen trust in most public institutions has been alarmingly decreasing owing to politicization of public sector, service delivery, political and bureaucratic corruption, lack of transparency, accountability, ethnic prejudice and partiality in the working of the public institutions. In this backdrop, this paper examines the level of citizen trust in selected institutions and explores factors that influence on trust. The study adopted mixed method approach to explore the problem phenomenon. The study finds that ethnic majority has more trust in public institutions than that of minority, and identity, language of administration and lack of equal representation in bureaucracy are also considerably determine level of trust citizens have in public institutions. Further, political patronage in service delivery has subverted quality of public institutions and trust, interestingly, citizens those who support and being affiliated with ruling party tend to have more trust in government. Police and village-level officers are least trusted owing to endemic corruption.

N2  - This work aims to analyze the risks and opportunities of introducing artificial intelligence and robotics into public administration. It is essential for public institutions to adopt a proactive strategy, they must take advantage of the technological revolution not only to renew their technical capacity, but especially to solve most of their conceptual and organizational problems. Artificial intelligence and robotics can be a great opportunity for a radical institutional and organizational renovation in public institutions and a contribution to their adaptation, relevance and survival in a complex governance context. The goal is beyond simple digitalization and technological innovation by taking advantage of the new technological paradigm to organize the different models and cultures of the Administration (bureaucratic, managerial, regulatory and governance) to achieve greater institutional strength. One of the main problems in contemporary public administrations is the confusion and confrontation between its different conceptual models. Artificial intelligence and robotics present a great opportunity to finally achieve a solid bureaucratic model that is objective, neutral, fast and efficient, by avoiding negative externalities such as an excessive rigidity and corporate drifts (bureaucracy without bureaucrats). A new bureaucratic model impervious to patronage and corruption. On the other hand, artificial intelligence and robotics will be able to facilitate a more effective and efficient management in new public administrations more intelligent and open to a greater citizen participation. We must propose and achieve a public administration that is together liquid, open, collaborative, creative and innovative but also solid, predictable and constant. It might seem an oxymoron, but the good work of the Administration in the future depends on the integration and complicity between these two souls: a public administration with greater institutional quality and intelligence capabilities.

N2  - Addressing consistency in the application of the law, former Attorney General Robert Jackson told Congress in 1940. ``It is obviously repugnant to one's sense of justice that the judgment meted out... should depend in large part on a purely fortuitous circumstance; namely the personality of the particular judge before whom the case happens to come for disposition. `` Yet in asylum cases, which can spell the difference between life and death, the outcome apparently depends in large measure on which government official decides the claim. In many cases, the most important moment in an asylum case is the instant in which a clerk randomly assigns an application to a particular asylum officer or immigration judge. This study analyzes databases of decisions from all four levels of the asylum adjudication process: 133,000 decisions involving nationals from eleven key countries rendered by 884 asylum officers over a seven-year period; 140,000 decisions of 225 immigration judges over a four-and-a-half-year period; 126, 000 decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals over a six-year period; and 4215 decisions of the U.S. courts of appeals during 2004 and 2005. The analysis reveals amazing disparities in grant rates, even when different adjudicators in the same office each considered large numbers of applications from nationals of the same country. For example, in one regional asylum office, 60\% of the officers decided in favor of Chinese applicants at rates that deviated by more than 50\% from that region's mean grant rate for Chinese applicants, with some officers granting asylum to no Chinese nationals, while other officers granted asylum in as many as 68\% of their cases. Similarly, Colombian asylum applicants whose cases were adjudicated in the federal immigration court in Miami had a 5\% chance of prevailing with one of that court's judges and an 88\% chance of prevailing before another judge in the same building. Half of the Miami judges deviated by more than 50\% from the court's mean grant rate for Colombian cases. Using cross-tabulations based on public biographies, the paper also explores correlations between sociological characteristics of individual immigration judges and their grant rates. The cross-tabulations show that the chance of winning asylum was strongly affected not only by the random assignment of a case to a particular immigration judge, but also in very large measure by the quality of an applicant's legal representation, by the gender of the immigration judge, and by the immigration judge's work experience prior to appointment. In their conclusion, the authors do not recommend enforced quota systems for asylum adjudicators, but they do make recommendations for more comprehensive training, more effective and independent appellate review, and other reforms that would further professionalize the adjudication system.

N2  - The relevance of differential science and technology choices for aggregate performance differentials must be traced to the micro level in terms of differential technology performance. This chapter aims to distinguish between the “demand” and “supply” sides governing the choice of appropriate technologies and the appropriate direction of innovative activity. The Japanese experience demonstrates the importance of the often neglected quality dimension of technology choice and change, often ignored by economists but lying at the heart of businessmen’s entrepreneurial options. More important on the demand side of appropriate technology choice is the effect of the differential macro-policy setting in the institutional/organizational dimension rather than the simple question of relative factor prices which has been much discussed in the literature. The macroeconomic policy setting in many developing countries is commonly oriented towards the support of powerful vested interest groups, mainly a new industrial class, organized workers and civil servants whose scramble for rents emerges under the so-called early import substitution/infant industry regime.

N2  - As historical and anthropological studies show, British colonial rule contributed decisively to the institutionalisation, politicisation and deterioration of intercommunal differences in Cyprus. However at the same time as British colonial authorities implemented divisive policies, they created one institution necessitating the smooth cooperation between Greek and Turkish Cypriots: the colonial bureaucracy, the structure and function of which remains understudied. Based on the cases of three Cypriots appealing against their dismissal from the colonial civil service, this paper argues that exploring the uncharted world of 'native' employees provides important insights into the inconsistencies underpinning British rule. Indeed, the debates prompted by the dismissal procedures shows that notions such as 'nationality', 'loyalty', 'legality' and 'civilisation' constituting the ideological foundations of colonial rule are rather indeterminate. The article makes a case for the study of subaltern Cypriots as a vantage point to explore the points of articulation and cross-fertilisation between colonial morality and local self-representations.

N2  - The aim of this research is to examine the role of state ownership in corporate governance and firm performance. We employed ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares regressions to analyze the effects of state ownership on firm performance. We go beyond existing research on state ownership by carefully disentangle investment objectives of state-controlled financial institutions. Such state ownership can be classified as profit-oriented and non-profit-oriented, in which the former consider return on investment to be the primary investment objective, whereas the latter prioritizes socio-economic development. We found that profit-oriented state ownership is an effective corporate governance mechanism and provides political patronage to the firm in the form of firm's specific resources and credit financing. Although non-profit-oriented state ownership firms also receive similar political patronage, they tend to be associated with inefficiencies such as the free-rider problems, bureaucracies and political intervention in firm management. We conclude that state ownership consists of heterogeneous entities with respect to corporate governance and firm performance.

N2  - This article explores general practitioners' (GPs) persuasive efforts in cases where biomedical evidence is absent but expected. Health insurance in Western countries is based on the biomedical ideal that legitimate complaints should have objective causes detectable by medical examination. For GPs responsible for assessing sickness and incapacity for work, the demand for objective evidence can be problematic: what if they as experts deem that a patient is in fact sick and eligible for benefits, but are unable to provide objective evidence to that fact? How can they convince bureaucrats in the insurance system to accept their judgment? Taking 'medically unexplained symptoms' as my case, I draw on focus group and follow-up interviews with GPs in Norway to explore how GPs attempt to persuade bureaucrats to accept their professional judgment. Proposing the concept of 'rhetorical work', I reconstruct a typology of such work that doctors engage in to influence bureaucratic decision-making and provide long-term health benefits for patients. I then discuss the potential societal implications of GPs' rhetorical practices and the applications of the concept of rhetorical work in future research.

N2  - There is a growing recognition of the role of meso-level institutions that operate between the central state and communities in facilitating climate change adaptation at local and district levels. This article explores how collaborative approaches to planned adaptation by an external agent in Ghana can create linkages between meso-level institutions and communities, and examines how the actors involved have received the approach. The study is based on fieldwork in the Northern and Upper East regions of Ghana. The programme examined has been designed to reflect the need of each community instead of general adaptation strategies. Findings from the study suggest that the communities involved have achieved positive outcomes from the approach. Capacity building and advocacy training have made the involved communities more proactive, which has increased the collaboration between the communities and local governance. Climate change adaptation has now become one of the key priorities on the political agenda of the local district assemblies. However, lack of funding hinders the achievements to be expanded to the rest of the district. More funding, therefore, needs to be directed at meso-level institutions to increase adaptation.

N2  - In this article, we examine the reasons behind national parliamentary engagement in the political dialogue with the Commission. We do so through a qualitative content analysis of over 200 national parliamentary opinions submitted to the Commission in recent years and interviews with national parliamentary representatives and Commission officials. We demonstrate that national parliaments’ engagement with the Commission is not simply a story about venue shopping in which parliaments seek to compensate for their domestic weaknesses. Their activity is driven by a rich repertoire of institutional actions, where parliaments simultaneously act as institutional lobbyists, traditionalists and communicators. They follow three main strategies, including attempts to control their government, influencing EU legislation directly, and engaging in parliamentary branding. Direct parliamentary lobbying of the Commission does not, however, render parliaments’ traditional role of controlling their government redundant as it improves domestic scrutiny methods.

N2  - Parliamentary processing of European Union (EU) matters in Finland has been characterized as consensual and pragmatic, with little if any public conflict between the political parties. The main goal is understood to be to achieve parliamentary unity - or at least broad consensus, which can arguably be translated into additional influence in EU-level bargaining. But the outbreak of the euro crisis and the 2011 Eduskunta elections triggered a major domestic politicization of Europe, which also affected parliamentary behaviour. EU issues are now debated more often in the full chamber, while voting has become more common in the EAC, with the losing opposition minority adding its dissenting opinions to the EU reports of the committees. Drawing on Eduskunta records and interviews with members of parliament (MPs) and civil servants, three hypotheses about the driving force behind this politicization are formulated: conflicting logics of appropriateness among MPs, the strategic incentives of the Finns Party, and frustration about euro crisis decision making. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

N2  - In any public policy-making process, political and economic forces are at play in resolving the strategic interactions among the public and special interests. A schematic representation of the policy-making process reflecting these forces is represented in Figure 4.1. Historically, the right-hand box has been the domain of political science, whereas the left-hand box has been the domain of economics. At the top of the right box, particular governance structures set the constitutional design establishing voting rules, the rule of law, property rights, laws governing exchange, and more generally the rules by which rules are made. Governance structures also determine the nature and scope of the political feedback mechanisms from groups affected by public policies. In its most expansive representation, any causal analysis of constitutional rules investigates the implications of alternative legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks, as well as various degrees of political, civil, and economic freedoms. In other words, governance structures set the boundaries for the political-economic link. Over the course of the last few decades, economists have begun to make significant theoretical and empirical advancements in analyzing the link between governance structures, political economics, and the selection of actual policies. Political-economic analysis seeks to explain the selection and implementation of public policies. This link in the policy-making process endogenizes the instrument settings as a function of governmental bureaucracy and the actions of stakeholders. Interest groups, as agents representing stakeholders, are the units of analysis.

N2  - Toward the end of The Shield's (FX, 2002-2008) second season, the writers of the series make the unusual move of inserting in medias res an episode that operates as a kind of prequel to the entire narrative covered by the show. This episode, titled "Co-pilot" (2.9), encompasses events immediately anterior to those presented in the original series pilot. Its foci are Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy's establishment of the satellite police precinct in Farmington, the appointment and arrival of some of the precinct's key figures, and the initial development of collegial rivalries and loyalties at the Barn. Most significant perhaps, the copilot tells the story of how the Strike Team came into being: it relates both the official establishment of the detail itself and the first, unofficial emergence of the unethical practices that will rapidly come to define its modus operandi. Corruption and brutality are not, it turns out, tactics toward which Mackey is somehow constitutionally disposed (we even witness him restrain Curtis Lemansky when he becomes too physical with one suspect), but to which, under certain institutional pressures, he has quickly grown habituated. This is made clear within the copilot in Mackey's management of the Strike Team's first case, the drive-by murder of two prostitutes. Here the team members are faced with knowing that their suspect, a dealer and pimp named Lionel Phipps, is guilty and yet being unable to ascertain his guilt formally within the limits of the law. Under pressure from both Gilroy and Captain David Aceveda to get immediate results, Mackey is reluctantly led to find a "shortcut." Planting crack in Phipps's apartment and blackmailing an associate of Phipps's to swear to its presence, Mackey obtains probable cause for searching the home of this otherwise untouchable suspect and gets his man. Significant in this particular narrative is the way in which the Strike Team's inaugural case is initially figured by those who secretly engineer it as exceptional. The decision to deploy blackmail and plant evidence is not made arbitrarily or casually but is impelled by a necessity specific to the case (there is no means at hand within the law for arresting the man who has broken the law) and to the immediate institutional pressures within the juridical system under which it has to be handled (the "bosses'" imperatives must be met). Thus, Mackey-with heavy dramatic irony apparent to anyone who has watched previous episodes- reassures his men by insisting that Phipps is a regrettable "one off": "Once we get our feet on solid ground, get a couple of wins under our belt, we go back to doing it the right way. We need this. Just this once" (emphasis added). Toward the end of the episode, however, there is a short but meaningful exchange between Mackey and his colleague Shane Vendrell. Vendrell takes him aside and informs him that he has spoken to the other Strike Team members about what happened with Phipps earlier in the day: vendrell: I talked to both of them, and they're cool about what went down. mackey: Good. vendrell: We got Lionel . . . mackey: Yeah. It was easy, wasn't it? vendrell: Yeah. A little too easy. With the cameras focused intensely on the two detectives' knowing smiles and with the viewer's knowledge of subsequent events, it is thus made clear-with great economy and understatement-that in "Co-pilot" we are witnessing the moment in which the supposed exceptionality of the Strike Team's inaugural case becomes tacitly structured into the very operation of the team's normal functioning. What is essential to stress here is the importance of chronology. The exchange is framed so as to emphasize its causal anteriority to the event that commentators endlessly describe as Mackey's "original sin"-the murder of Aceveda's late addition to the Strike Team, Terry Crowley.1 The exchange between Vendrell and Mackey significantly takes place just as the latter is leaving the Barn to meet Crowley for the first time and bring him back to introduce to the team. We know from the original series pilot that Mackey will murder Crowley because Crowley has been tasked with covertly investigating Strike Team corruption. What we witness in "Copilot," then, is not just the one and only manifestation of the Strike Team before the addition of Crowley, but the foundational establishment of the ethos within the team that will make Crowley's murder inevitable. My point in underscoring this sequence of events is that "Co-pilot" introduces into The Shield and into the story of Mackey's violent itinerary an element that is, in effect, even more originary than the putative "original sin": namely, the narrative of how exception has become the rule. It is true that Crowley's murder is akin to what in dramatic tragedy would be referred to as the pro-tarchos ate- (primal crime):2 it haunts Mackey's entire career and constitutes the most significant and dramatic portion of his eventual confession in season 7. But what "Co-pilot" introduces and articulates is the determination of a critical foundation to which even that "primal" transgression is secondary. Everything in Mackey's and the Strike Team's professional trajectory depends on this dramatically understated yet constitutive moment. The truly originary event in the Strike Team's history is precisely this tacit movement whereby an emergency measure, undertaken with the initial aim of "doing it the right way" in future, becomes in effect the essential paradigm for future engagement. This essay teases out the critical stakes of the Strike Team's foundational narrative in order to offer an analysis of the "politics of exception" in The Shield. Drawing on the work of Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, I situate the imbrication between the show's thematic preoccupation with exceptional juridical measures and the particular cultural and political climate in which the show emerged. Agamben's account of the politics of exception, I suggest, offers a critical framework from within which we can both grasp the conceptual determinations that lie behind the rapid drama of Mackey's policing and begin to interrogate the problematic ideological investments that the representation of his policing evinces. I go on to track the ways in which the series habitually frames and structures Mackey's professional deployment of extralegal tactics in order to propose that in spite of the apparent negations articulated within the series, The Shield retains a fundamental structural complicity with Mackey and with the mode of sovereign power he embodies.

N2  - Background: Limited research has focused on undocumented immigrants' health and access to care. Objectives: This paper describes participant engagement strategies used to investigate the health needs of immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Methods: Community-based strategies engaged advocates and undocumented Californians in study design and recruitment. Outreach in diverse settings, social media, and participant-driven sampling recruited 61 DACA-eligible focus group participants. Lessons Learned: Social media, community-based organizations (CBOs), family members, advocacy groups, and participant:driven sampling were the most successful recruitment strategies. Participants felt engaging in research was instrumental for sharing their concerns with health care providers and policymakers, noteworthy in light of their previously identified fears and mistrust of government officials. Conclusions: Using multiple culturally responsive strategies including participant-driven sampling, engagement with CBOs, and use of social media, those eligible for DACA eagerly engage as research participants. Educating researchers and institutional review boards (IRBs) about legal and safety concerns can improve research engagement.

N2  - Existing work on state building focuses on the creation of modern bureaucracies and institutions for education and taxation but generally neglects to point to communal property regimes as tools of statecraft. Political science scholars who focus on ethnic communal lands in the Americas emphasize the rise of formal multicultural institutions, including Indigenous land rights, but are skeptical about governments' willingness to title large extensions of land to Indigenous or other ethnic groups because of opposing economic interests. Focusing on the titling of 12 percent of Honduras's territory between 2012 and 2016, this article uses semi-structured elite interviews, land titling data, field notes from three months in rural and urban sites in Honduras, and drug trafficking reports to examine the motivation of officials in the central government. Evidence suggests that the central government views and uses ethnic land titling as a strategy to reclaim territorial dominance in contested locations that lack state presence.

N2  - The post-1994 democratic developmental South African state opted for a strong local government system which has been constitutionalised, in terms of Chapter 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996. The politicisation of the local bureaucracy was inevitable as the ruling party sought to ensure that the executive leadership of municipalities shared the same political ideology and vision to facilitate local development. This raises the question, where does politicisation commence and end, and what is the ideal local political interface for efficient and effective service delivery and, more importantly, to ensure good governance? These questions have to take cognisance of the fact that South Africa is a `struggle democracy' and development has to take place in historically disadvantaged areas, where services have been poor or non-existent. The historically advantaged areas have to also be maintained and upgraded, as they are key to financial sustainability of the municipalities. The increasing service delivery protests is a matter for concern, if one has to take cognisance of the popular adage highlighted in official literature, `if local government fails, South Arica fails'. Given that the struggles for a democratic South Africa were fought at the grassroots level, this has to translate to an improved quality of life for local communities. Consequently, sound political management is key to enhanced municipal service delivery and ultimately good local governance. This paper reviews political trends and developments up to 2016, but excludes any discussion on the recent local government elections.

N2  - States tightly regulate access to alcohol and other substances. During the pandemic and related state of emergency, state and federal governments adopted a variety of regulations affecting this access. State shelter-in-place orders included decisions about whether liquor stores and marijuana dispensaries are essential businesses. Decisions about telehealth access to medical marijuana or treatments for substance use disorders were made at the state and federal levels. This article examines the political economy behind these decisions, focusing on deviations from the norm including Pennsylvania's decision to close state-run liquor stores. Interest groups and other political considerations help explain state and federal policy changes affecting access to alcohol and other substances.

N2  - This paper will examine how animal protection investigators, lobbyists and campaigners in Scotland consider the relationship between nature and ethics. Specifically, it will look at the complex ways in which activists deploy the categories natural' and unnatural' in order to interpret realms of animal suffering and judge the actions of human and non-human agents in those fields. The paper is also concerned with charting the ways in which animal protection activists develop strategies for persuading various audiences of the rightness of their position; these include not only charity supporters and prospective donors, but also politicians and civil servants involved in the legislative process in the Scottish Parliament. More broadly, the paper engages with debates in the emergent fields of the anthropology of ethics and human-animal relations. It is interested in the relationship between ethics and appearance and in the distribution of agency in claims or judgements of ethical or unethical behaviour.

N2  - In order to achieve good quality regulation, a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) may be necessary. This is particularly the case in developing countries, where poor quality regulation is a challenge. As a developing country, Turkey has some regulatory institutions in certain sectors, but these are somewhat weak and subject to historical concerns with an over-powerful bureaucracy, politicisation and executive influence, and dynamics that create rather than curtail rent-seeking behaviours. Therefore, it might be useful to discuss the possibility of better regulation using a new regulatory perspective. For this purpose, evaluation through a RIA is advised. Here, information about the history and development of regulatory institutions presently operating in Turkey is provided, along with discussion of a new regulatory perspective.

N2  - The German system of public sector employment (including civil servants and public employees) qualifies as a classical European continental civil service model moulded in traditional forms of a Weberian bureaucracy. Its features include a career-based employment system with entry based on levels of formal qualification. Coordinated by legal frames and centralised collective bargaining, the civil service is, at the same time, decentralised and flexible enough to accommodate regional differences and societal changes. In comparison, the civil service system stands out for its high degrees of professionalism and legal fairness with low levels of corruption or cronyism.

N2  - The first federal employees (other than Founding Fathers) were clerks. As federal employment grew in the 1820s, its ranks came to be dominated by patronage workers. After the Civil War, bureaucrats slowly displaced patronage workers at the federal level. Now, federal employments are being privatized and the bureaucracy shrunk. I explain this evolution of federal employment with one simple model of politics in a changing environment. Politicians combine into political firms to promise benefits to subsets of voters in return for election. If elected, politicians provide the benefits as efficiently as possible. Thus, politicians choose the form and size of their political firms to maximize expected political profits. Environmental changes affect the choices. The breach of the Appalachians in the 1810s, defeat of the South in the Civil War and the simultaneous rise of big and transcontinental industry, and contemporary worldwide economic integration (globalization) are three environmental changes that changed the efficient organization of federal political firms.

N2  - In this paper, the policy of nature conservation in Norway is analysed, with a particular focus on policy development during the last decade moving in the direction of multi-level governance. It is argued that the logic of policy making has shifted from what can be described as 'the politics of expertise' to a process of 'politicisation'. A process of politicisation can be observed both in terms of the nature of arguments being used, and in terms of who the dominant actors are. The subjects of analysis are issues taken up by the political parties in the Parliament, and the paper focuses on two controversial questions. One is about the localisation of conservation areas on private land and the state's liability for compensation. The other is the question of whether the management of conservation areas, and in particular national parks, should be under the control of local government or the state environmental bureaucracy. The analysis documents a process moving in the direction of more complex governance structure involving more actors and broader local participation challenging the role of the professional bureaucracy.

N2  - Authoritarian leaders rely on regional leaders for both political support and the fulfillment of their policy objectives. In addition, top leaders face trade-offs between following established rules for managing bureaucratic officials’ careers and exercising a free hand in choosing regional officials. This paper compares patterns of appointment of regional officials in Russia and China before and after 2012. In recent years, the leaders of both countries have centralized and personalized state power. We hypothesize that these changes have altered policies for managing the appointments of regional leaders in such a way as to increase their dependence on the central authorities and reduce their autonomy to create their own networks at the regional level. We analyze a comprehensive original set of biographical data on all top regional officials from 2003 through 2019 in China and from 2000 through 2019 in Russia. We discern clear differences between the pre- and post-2012 period for China and less marked differences for pre- and post-2012 Russia. Turnover of regional officials has become more frequent in both systems; average tenure in office has fallen; and the share of “outsiders” has risen. However, the corps of regional officials has not been rejuvenated.

N2  - With the development of industry and commerce after Tianjin's opening as a treaty port, the urban poor were in an unfavorable situation in controlling the social resources. Facing a large number of urban poor, the state represented by government officials of various levels and the civil society represented by local gentry-merchants have clearly recognized the widened gap and increased opposition in all social strata and communities while the disintegration was close to cross the bottom line. It will affect the social harmony and cause unrests. Therefore, under their advocacy and support, all kinds of relief and charity institutes come into being and play a positive role in balancing the social wealth, helping the lower class, improving the social justice and maintaining the stability of social order. © Higher Education Press 2007.

N2  - We examine the deregulation of an audit requirement for a group of private Canadian companies. In particular, we study the circumstances surrounding this deregulation and the impact of the change in legislation on the subsequent purchase of audit services. The study was done through the examination of archival documents relating to the change to the legislation, together with a survey of Chief Financial Officers of companies that were affected by this change in legislation. We found that the federal government justified the change as a response to a perceived threat to the viability of the federal incorporation legislation, and that the government pursued this course in spite of the lobbying efforts of representatives from the accounting profession. Approximately one-quarter of the companies whose audit requirement was deregulated, purchased lesser levels of assurance services or no assurance services after the change in legislation.

N2  - Post Cold War insurgents in administratively weak states prove increasingly likely to abjure ideological motives, or to organize themselves as reformist alternatives to a regime in exchange for superpower patronage. Insurgents continue to enjoy access to weapons, and benefit from the growing reluctance of officials in strong states to intervene against them directly. Officials in strong states instead choose to exercise influence through recruiting private investors and private security companies as proxies. Rulers of very weak states use their relations with these proxies to pursue private political and commercial agendas to a greater degree than was usual during the Cold War. The result is a decrease in rulers' interests in maintaining internal administrative hierarchies, controlling territory and monopolizing the exercise of violence, all regarded as conventional features of states. This signals an unexpected strength of very weak state rulers to pursue goals and agendas without building bureaucracies of their own. Officials in strong states tacitly accept this deviation from expectations regarding state behavior in the interest of maintaining order and preserving regimes that pay lip service to standard norms of state behavior.

2001
N2  - The celebration of the 200th birthday of the courts of the District of Columbia offers an opportunity to focus on the diversification and proliferation of the federal institutions of judging. During the twentieth century, the federal courts and Congress worked together to create a host of statutory federal judges, including magistrate and bankruptcy judges who serve through appointments from Article III judges, as well as administrative law judges and heating officers working within agencies. In addition to inventing this array of judicial officers, the federal judiciary also redefined the work of judging to include efforts to settle cases and to influence congressional deployment and allocation of jurisdiction. The innovations have many sources. One is doctrinal. The authority of statutory judges stems from a rereading of Article III to license a great deal of federal adjudication without Article III's structural protections. As litigants challenged the devolution of judicial power their claims became an occasion to explore the import of judicial independence. In general, the life-tenured judiciary permitted (and sometimes welcomed) congressional generation of many adjudicative forms, seen not to pose a threat to ``Article III values.{''} The doctrine in turn was crafted in the face of pressures from an expanding federal docket that required some form of change. The particular programs chosen were based in part on perceptions of the lessening utility of adjudicatory methods, in part on a sense of varying levels of import of cases within the federal docket, and in part on incentives created by legal rules and practices. For example, magistrate judgeships were particularly useful for the Article III judiciary, which gained the power to create slots without the need to obtain specific lines from Congress. As of 2000 the number of non-life-tenured judgeships within Article III was roughly equal to the number of life-tenured trial judgeships. Moreover in some twenty federal districts, the number of magistrate judges equaled or exceeded that of district judges. What are the effects of such innovations on the constitutional commitment to, and the prudential belief it?, judicial independence? In addition to focusing on the import of contemporary doctrine, Professor Resnik examines the relatively new practices of the appointment and reappointment of judges by judges. After showing the degree to which the life-tenured judiciary is dependent on, and its fortunes are linked with, its non-life-tenured siblings, Professor Resnik argues that Article III judges ought to learn to relax their own status privileges and attempt, self-consciously to blur distinctions among kinds of judges so as to broaden the embrace of Article III. ``Article III values{''} are, it, her view, at stake, and their preservation requires life-tenured judges to attempt to infuse these values into all aspects of federal judging.

N2  - While research on legal mobilization shows how social movements contribute to the definition and implementation of rights, it remains excessively centered on litigation to the detriment of administrative rights enforcement. This article maps out how street-level bureaucracies impact rights enforcement by distinguishing between allocation, access, and process, and analyzes how social movements intervene in these three aspects. It then focuses on allocation, using the case of French disability policy to analyze the forms of advocacy deployed by movement actors who take part in the rights allocation process at the local level. The article argues that conformity to institutional norms derives not so much from a pressure to conform as from the knowledge and experience of the limited means locally available to make rights effective. Further, it shows how advocacy is reframed from the defense of individual claims to a role of scrutiny and control of the bureaucratic allocation of rights.

N2  - Over the last decade, many developing countries have adopted the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). Despite the promise of bringing economic development, the results have been largely disappointing. The conventional wisdom is that the lack of administrative capacity and data availability are the two main reasons behind this failure. However, an in-depth analysis of two recent high-impact RIAs performed by Mexican authorities reveals that regulatory capture might be an additional and significant problem. In both cases, RIAs appear as merely instrumental to confer a scientific aura to the political rhetoric supporting a regulation that favored a specific interest group. In this vein, absent a sufficiently strong system of checks and balances, a greater sophistication of government officials might paradoxically reduce accountability and transparency. In the last section, we briefly sketch a possible reform aimed at preventing this risk, namely the introduction of a supranational non-binding process of appeal against especially relevant RIAs.

N2  - Federal agencies are important players in the formulation of statutes. As an object of study and as part of the governmental process, academic public administration has shown little interest in the nature and extent of civil servants' involvement in this phenomenon, or in its ramifications. Making use of some data from survey research questionnaires as well as recently published histories of congressional enactments, this article seeks to open the door a little bit on this subject. Preliminary findings suggest that administrators are a significant influence from the earliest stages of statutes' evolution, impacting both important and run-of-the-mine enactments. That influence is evident in the frequency with which many agencies initiate and pursue their own legislative agendas year by year, draft their own bills, and participate in shaping policy objectives arising within Congress and among interest groups. By law, agencies are supposed to clear proposals through OMB before going to Congress, but as we will not, clearance can be a relative thing. Few proposed initiatives emanate directly from the White House. Tax and spending bills were excluded from the study, as were private bills. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - We explore how institutional design, whether a position is elected or appointed, influences women's representation in state executive leadership positions, including cabinet secretaries and heads of bureaucratic agencies. We expect this relationship is conditional on if the position addresses a stereotypically feminine or masculine policy area. As women are less politically ambitious and perceive electoral disadvantages in running for masculine positions, we expect the pool of women willing to accept an appointed masculine position is greater than those willing to run for elected office. However, for feminine positions, women may perceive their gender as an advantage and are more willing to run. Using original data of state executive leaders, we find women are more likely to serve in elected than appointed feminine positions, but the opposite is true for masculine positions. This article provides insight into how institutional decisions can impact the presence of underrepresented groups in government.

N2  - This book explores how the governmental elites in Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa understand their Westminster system. It examines in detail four interrelated features of Westminster systems: firstly, the increasing centralization in collective, responsible cabinet government; second, the constitutional convention of ministerial and collective responsibility; third, the role of a professional, non-partisan public service; and finally, parliament's relationship to the executive. The book explains the changes that have occurred in the Westminster model by analyzing four traditions: royal prerogative, responsible government, constitutional bureaucracy, and representative government. It suggests that each tradition has a recurring dilemma, between centralization and decentralization, party government and ministerial responsibility, professionalization and politicization, and finally elitism and participation. The chapter goes on to argue that these dilemmas recur in four present-day debates: the growth of prime ministerial power, the decline in individual and collective ministerial accountability, politicization of the public service, and executive dominance of the legislature. It concludes by identifying five meanings of, or narratives about, Westminster. Firstly, 'Westminster as heritage' - elite actors' shared governmental narrative understood as both precedents and nostalgia. Second, 'Westminster as political tool' - the expedient cloak worn by governments and politicians to defend themselves and criticize opponents. Third, 'Westminster as legitimizing tradition' - providing legitimacy and a context for elite actions, serving as a point of reference to navigate this uncertain world. Fourth, 'Westminster as institutional category' - a useful descriptor of a loose family of governments with shared origins and characteristics. Finally, 'Westminster as an effective political system' -a more effective and efficient political system than consensual parliamentary governments. Westminster is a flexible family of ideas that is useful for many purposes and survives, even thrives, because of its meaning in use to elite actors.

N2  - This article challenges the assertion that civil servants with technical training can be assumed to be technocrats. Contrary to previous findings, the article argues that type of higher education is not a key determinant of variations in technocratic mentality among elite bureaucrats; instead, post-socialization provides a better explanation. One suggested post-socialization mechanism is politicisation, so the more politicized a ministry is, the less technocratic the mentality of the bureaucrats working in it. These suggestions are tested empirically by both re-analysing Putnam's data from the late 1970s and analysing data from a total survey of elite bureaucrats working in the Government Offices of Sweden. As well as demonstrating that the 'type of training hypothesis' is poorly supported, the empirical analysis demonstrates that the technocratic mentality of bureaucrats varies depending on ministerial affiliation. Furthermore, the level of politicisation is connected to the degree of technocratic mentality among the bureaucrats, though not exactly as hypothesized: more politicisation indeed leads to higher 'tolerance for politics' among bureaucrats but, counter intuitively, also makes bureaucrats more likely to advocate neutrality rather than political advocacy among civil servants. © The Author(s), 2011.

N2  - The role of permanent secretary represents the apogee of a career in the Whitehall bureaucracy. Even so it is under-researched and, with exceptions, notably Dunleavy et al. on bureau shaping, under-theorised. Emanating from a longitudinal survey of eight successive permanent secretaries at the Ministry of Education from 1976 to 2011, this paper identifies them as members of a meta-political class who, whilst influencing the policy decisions of politicians, are nonetheless not members of the political class. A model locating them across a spectrum of six related yet distinct genres of ‘centrism’, and a continuum of five contingent descriptive styles is used to illustrate and interpret their praxis.

N2  - This paper reports a study of permanent secretaries who served at the Department for Education (DfE) from 1975 to 2011. Located within a context of theories that explain how government bureaucracies operate, it focuses on Michael Bichard. Appointed in July 1995 when attempts were being made to open Whitehall to non-career civil servants, he retired in May 2001 having served 21 months with a Conservative and 48 months with a Labour Secretary of State. He was an unusual permanent secretary. An outsider, state school and red-brick university educated whose father had been a docker, his prior service was in local government. Inter alia, the paper traces his background and career; his role in the merger of the Departments for Education and Employment (DfEE); his relationship with his Secretaries of State; his contribution to education policy; and his estimation of his style and achievements. Consideration is also given to the value of external appointments and to the merits of a descriptive based approach to the study of public sector administration.

In contrast to the dominant view that these dual transitions produced an atomized civil society and an impenetrable technocratic state, Rich finds a new model of interest politics, driven by previously marginalized state and societal actors. Through a rich examination of the Brazilian AIDS movement, one of the most influential movements in twenty-first century Latin America, this book traces the construction of a powerful new advocacy coalition between activist bureaucrats and bureaucratized activists. In so doing, State-Sponsored Activism illustrates a model whereby corporatism - active government involvement in civic mobilization - has persisted in contemporary Latin America, with important implications for representation and policymaking. © Jessica A.

N2  - Federal civil servants need policy expertise to formulate and implement public policy. Presidents and congresses do not confer such expertise when they delegate responsibility for policy making. Existing research suggests that elected officials' efforts to gain control of federal agencies can reduce agency expertise by inducing civil servants to exit the agency and reducing incentives for civil servants to exert effort, including acquiring policy expertise. I use data from an original survey of federal executives to examine whether politicization reduces agency expertise. I find that civil servants whose policy preferences diverge from those of political appointees are more likely to perceive that their agency is politicized and that civil servants who perceive their agency is politicized are more likely to exit the agency and less likely to engage in behaviors that build policy expertise. In total, these findings provide systematic, microlevel evidence demonstrating how politicization can reduce agency policy expertise.

N2  - Despite a history of participatory policies, Thailand's Royal Irrigation Department (RID) has had little success in developing water user organisations (WUOs) capable of facilitating cooperation between farmers and the irrigation agency. Even so, pockets of participation exist. What can explain these rare successes? What policy lessons can they provide? Comparing nine WUOs, I identify factors that contribute to the emergence of relatively successful groups. Most importantly, I show that successful WUOs are contingent on the actions of local irrigation officials. These findings emphasise the important role of street-level bureaucrats in implementing participatory policies. The incentive structures provided by the RID, though, deter most officials from sincerely collaborating and cooperating with farmers. Thus experts and policy-makers interested in promoting participatory resource management should focus more attention on shaping incentives for local officials to engage meaningfully with farmers.

N2  - The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 aimed, among other things, to increase parents' rights in relation to the education of their children. In addition to the creation of the Additional Supports Needs Tribunals for Scotland, parents were given new rights to challenge local authority decisions through mediation and independent adjudication. In line with the wider social policy thrust of encouraging proportionate dispute resolution, low-level resolution of disputes at school and local authority level was also encouraged. This paper uses key informant interviews to explore the views of new dispute resolution arrangements, and whether the balance of power has indeed tipped in favour of parents. Local education authority officers expressed some concerns about the new measures, and were particularly critical of the tribunal on the grounds that it was expensive and stressful, although the role it might play in tightening up procedures was also recognised. Advocacy groups and parents' organisations, on the other hand, welcomed the new measures but were concerned about the rules restricting access to the tribunal and the fact that the outcome of mediation and adjudications were not legally binding. They were also concerned about limited access to information and advocacy. Overall, key informants believed that the new measures had advanced parents' rights to some extent, although further changes were needed to achieve a radical shift away from the post-war dominance of bureaucracy and professionalism in Scotland.

N2  - Modem states need a system of public administration that is capable of implementing its policies well enough tosatisfy its citizens and also to retain the support of its bureaucrats. Two variable dimensions of the bureaucratic design profoundly affect both the extent of bureaucratic power and the administrative capabilities of a bureaucracy: duration in office and the qualifications of officeholders. Empowered officials are better administrators than powerless ones, provided they cannot become politically dominant. A relatively stable semipowerful bureaucracy has emerged in the UnitedStates during the last century as a result of its exceptional mixture of short-termers and professionalized careerists. This mixture has enhanced the regime's administrative capabilities while curtailing bureaucratic power. The countries that experienced few or no military coups made the transition to modem bureaucracy before experiencing a radical proliferation in the number of salaried officials. Patronage has been largely eliminated in contemporary parliamentary regimes infavor of careerist bureaucracies. © 1994 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This book comparatively analyzes civil societal actors who have advocated for children's rights, the environment, and freedom of information in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. Successful issue framing and effective alliance building are identified as important "pathways" to participation. In some cases of policy making, members of non-governmental organizations and other groups influence the agenda, provide analysis, collaborate with government officials in the formulation of policy, and pressure legislators to adopt reforms. These activists do not merely respond to existing "political opportunities," they are creating opportunities for participation. A close examination of their advocacy campaigns and efforts to gain influence is necessary to strengthen our understanding of the region's democracies.

N2  - Recent scholarly attention has focused on weak governance and the negative effects of corruption on the provision of health services. Employing agency theory, this article discusses corruption in the South African health sector. We used a combination of research methods and triangulated data from three sources: Auditor-General of South Africa reports for each province covering a 9-year period; 13 semi-structured interviews with health sector key informants and a content analysis of print media reports covering a 3-year period. Findings from the Auditor-General reports showed a worsening trend in audit outcomes with marked variation across the nine provinces. Key-informants indicated that corruption has a negative effect on patient care and the morale of healthcare workers. The majority of the print media reports on corruption concerned the public health sector (63%) and involved provincial health departments (45%). Characteristics and complexity of the public health sector may increase its vulnerability to corruption, but the private-public binary constitutes a false dichotomy as corruption often involves agents from both sectors. Notwithstanding the lack of global validated indicators to measure corruption, our findings suggest that corruption is a problem in the South African healthcare sector. Corruption is influenced by adverse agent selection, lack of mechanisms to detect corruption and a failure to sanction those involved in corrupt activities. We conclude that appropriate legislation is a necessary, but not sufficient intervention to reduce corruption. We propose that mechanisms to reduce corruption must include the political will to run corruption-free health services, effective government to enforce laws, appropriate systems, and citizen involvement and advocacy to hold public officials accountable. Importantly, the institutionalization of a functional bureaucracy and public servants with the right skills, competencies, ethics and value systems and whose interests are aligned with health system goals are critical interventions in the fight against corruption.

N2  - Public policy is produced by elected and unelected officials and through
the interactions of branches of government. We consider how such
interactions affect policy implementation and representation. We argue
that legislators try to influence bureaucratic decisions through direct
communication with federal agencies, and that such contact is effective
and has consequences for policy outcomes. We provide empirical evidence
of this argument using original data about direct communication between
members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) along with
decisions made by the DOL regarding trade and redistributive policies.
We find that direct contacts influence DOL decisions, and the agency is
more likely to reverse previous decisions when requested to do so by
legislators. Our results challenge key assumptions and findings in the
previous literature and have important implications for interbranch
relations and informal means of control over the implementation of
national policy.

N2  - An underappreciated way members of Congress represent interests is by pursuing policy goals through their communication with the bureaucracy. I argue that the bureaucracy provides an alternative, covert way for cross-pressured legislators, who face diverging pressures fromparty leaders, interest groups, and subconstituencies, to satisfy conflicting interests. Using original data of senators' communication with the US Department of Labor from 2005 to 2012 (109th through 112th Congresses), I show that, when faced with cross-pressures fromparty and constituency, senators strategically choose less visible, back-channel means for pursuing policy goals. These findings provide a new perspective on representation by demonstrating that legislators pursue policy goals outside of the legislative process in an effort to evade accountability.

N2  - The open, multilevel nature of U.S. policymaking enables interest group activity throughout the policy process. At policy implementation, groups attempt to secure benefits or ameliorate legislated effects by devising cooperative or conflictual strategies to influence outcomes, especially when agency officials have discretion to design rules and negotiate agreements. Investigating group " street-level" activity with respect to the Endangered Species Act, this research finds that policy context and resources shape the degree of information and access available to groups, which influences the strategies groups adopt. Groups with access and specialized information will attempt to change or influence policy outcomes cooperatively. Groups with limited technical information are more likely to fight implementation.

N2  - Focused on the experts groups of the European Commission, this article aims to understand not only who the European experts are, but also on what grounds. It adopts a sociological perspective, paying attention to the social properties of those actors, in order to better grasp which type of actors can gain access to the European policy-making process by this way, but also how the experts authority can get the upper hand in the European arena, and under what conditions it may be exerted. The article begins with an overview of the space of European expertise: highlighting the political uses of the groups to explain the privileged recruitment of experts in certain categories of practitioners (academics, members of interest groups, national civil servants and so on). These political uses of expertise also contribute to promoting particular resources and practices, leading to analysis of the properties shared by the experts, in spite of their apparent heterogeneity. A number of these properties are moreover acquired in the European space, inviting to take a closer look at the way these expertise functions are fulfilled in professional trajectories associated with EU institutions.

N2  - The Spadina Expressway controversy in Toronto, Ontario, was sparked by a proposal to run an expressway into the heart of the city. The dispute was part of a broader movement against high modernist planning that swept American and Canadian cities in the 1960s and 1970s. Frustrated by unresponsive politicians and civic officials, citizen activists challenged authorities with an alternate vision for cities that prioritized the safeguarding of the urban environment by preserving communities, preventing environmental degradation, and promoting public transit. By the latter half of the 1960s, citizen activists were no longer fighting alone, as some politicians and civil servants also turned against more traditional modes of city planning. This politicization of urban planning and transportation schemes culminated in the defeat of expressway networks in cities across Canada and the United States, including the Spadina Expressway in 1971. A landmark decision and important precursor to the municipal reform movement that would follow, the legacy of the Spadina episode was nevertheless mixed.

N2  - In virtually every democratic political system, there is an expectation that the bureaucracy provides ballast and stability to the ostensible changes wrought through the electoral process. New political leadership energizes the policy process by bringing into play different ideas, people, and directions (Bunce, 1980). Bureaucracy stabilizes the process by building political support systems to bolster the programs it maintains, such that, regardless of who is in power, it will produce fairly predictable responses. The practice of building a network of support around programs is a means of institutionalizing the programs. Precisely because political leaders want to institutionalize their preferences over time but also to be left with a minimum of institutionalization by their predecessors (Moe, 1988, 1990), one should expect that at the outset of any new presidential administration there will be tension between the newly elected political leadership and the established bureaucracy (Aberbach and Rockman, 1976). The newly arrived executive leadership wants maximum discretion and minimum restriction by the past. The bureaucracy, in turn, wants stability produced by institutionalizing the past. The newly arrived political leadership in the executive may wish to overturn apple carts, but that is not such an easy matter because the programs administered by the bureaucracy have their own network of political alliances. These alliances are usually centered in Congress and backed by interest groups representing constituencies affected by the programs or at least by advocates of them.

N2  - The officer core of the Prison Guard (Straz Wiezienna, SW), a formation established only as late as 1932, emerged from the narrow circle of persons associated with the Prison Section, which emerged in 1918. Its membership consisted of a small cadre of Polish guards who had gained experience in prisons controlled by the occupying powers. Unless they had worked in prisons before 1918, the rank-and-file of the SW consisted of demobilised and/or retired soldiers as well as of would-be or ex-policemen. `Street people' in many cases, they treated the work as temporary or took it up as an easy job. The reality they faced on the other side of the wall quickly verified their convictions about the task they had accepted. As a result, the ranks of the SW were given to heavy rotation, evident up to 1939. Employees of the interwar prison system did not enjoy much public regard; for some, leaving the army to become a prison guard felt like social degradation. Aside from a few minor exceptions - such as prison breaks, stories of convict abuse - this peculiar group of workers was generally absent from the public narrative of the re-established state. Naturally, its problems were debated among experts, but these debates did not seep into the press as often as those concerning the police. For many years after 1918, the SW continued to be perceived through the nineteenth-century image of the guard as watchman, a personification of the oppressive partition governments. SW functionaries associated with the labour union established in 1932 as well as the Przeglad Wieziennictwa Polskiego (Polish Penal Review) magazine took up the daunting task of improving that image. The article provides an analysis of their efforts, attempting a response whether their goals were achieved, at least to a degree. My focus is on the public perception of the formation, while I also try to establish whether its foundation and development was perceived as a success (as was the case, for instance, with the police). My interests, however, are not limited to the media and public image of the SW corps, but also include the conditions under which its members laboured. In this context, I am particularly interested in the realities of the prison corridor; in the article, I attempt to describe the tenor of the relations between guards and prisoners in contemporary prisons (especially the prevailing aggression). Finally, I pursue a reconstruction of the image/s of the SW created by convicts, with particular focus on the significance of the change associated with the year 1918. My analysis leads to somewhat pessimistic conclusions. The major changes involved in the professionalization of the cadres and partial implementation of the prison reform that also affected the SW do not appear to have been satisfactory. Attempts to dismantle stereotypes of the guards could only achieve limited success, and the SW remained a formation of thoroughly dubious quality.

N2  - How did the various legislative initiatives on access to information in Brazil culminate in the 12.527/11 federal law? Using the Advocacy Coalition Framework, this article analyzes the agenda setting and strategies of different coalitions, analyzing a broad array of news, interviews, laws, and official documents between 2001 and 2012. Two coalitions were identified: one in favor of changes in legislation, comprised of sectors of the Executive, legislative, the media and civil society; and another in favor of the maintenance of restrictive rules of access to information, composed of Armed Forces, Itamaraty (Brazil's diplomatic corps) and the Senate's Legislative Commission on Defense and Foreign Affairs. The article also identifies an overlap of two public policy subsystems: the transparency subsystem and the reconciliation one. The latter monopolized the public debate on the subject, contributing to the slowness in approving a transparency law. Itamaraty also emerges as the author of a strong lobby against changes in the rules for document classification, for reasons yet to be studied.

N2  - The literature on transnational advocacy networks (TANs) suggests that they may be a valid option for activists in India, Brazil and South Africa (the members of the IBSA bloc) to coordinate efforts to influence their states' foreign policy. Since its formation the IBSA bloc has formalised spaces for networking among governmental officials, business interests and academics. Yet there are no examples of TANs whose activism has occurred across IBSA, with the purpose of influencing the bloc's policies. This case study of the challenges that Brazilian advocacy groups face in forging TANs with like-minded groups across IBSA sheds light on the challenges confronting activists and suggests ways of overcoming them.

N2  - The study focuses on the role of policy advice brokers - political advisors - pertaining to the issue of politicization in the European Commission (EC). The study conceptualizes politicization as increased use of political advisors - known as ``cabinets{''} in the EC context - by the Commissioners to ensure political direction over the work of the civil service. Commissioners' private cabinets fulfil several functions, one of which is political steering of the policy work in the departments. The study argues that as a result of the NPM-style reform and strengthening of the civil service accountability to the political level, the political steering function of the cabinet advisors grew in importance. To examine whether the political steering function of cabinets became more important after the reform, the study analyzed the lists of cabinets' responsibilities available online from the Prodi to the Junker Commissions. The content of the lists of responsibilities was first coded and then statistically analyzed testing for the effect of the reform on the structure of cabinets' responsibilities.

N2  - We study presidential patronage as a form of distributive politics. To
do so, we introduce comprehensive data on supervisory personnel in the
executive branch between 1925 and 1959 and link each bureaucrat to the
congressional representative from their home district. We identify
testable hypotheses regarding the impact of electoral considerations,
partisanship, and legislative support on the distribution of
bureaucratic appointments across districts. Results from a variety of
fixed-eats estimation strategies are consistent with several forms of
presidential patronage. Our results provide initial evidence about the
mechanisms through which patronage appointments are administered in the
executive branch and illustrate how presidential politics affects the
composition of the federal government.

N2  - Communist participation in Gabriel González Videla's Government had one of its most significant milestones the appointment of militantes as minister, mayors, governors and advisers in fiscal and semi-fiscal institutions. Since Popular Front's government communists have participated in a triumphant alliance, but this was the first time the Communist Party assumed a central position with a government, promoting a program that included structural reforms. Although the situation turned out to be complex (in transition from anti-fascist struggle to anti imperialist and anti-oligarchic proposas), experience forced the Chilean Communist Party to seek a way to integrate its governmental responsibilities with its revolutionary vocacion, in local and global perspectives. This articles explores the first experience of governmental participation of Chilean communists, based on archival documentation.

N2  - Much has been made of the `imperial' influence of international actors
(Chopra 2000) and their view of Timor-Leste as a petri dish for
post-conflict development. However, this view obscures the ways in which
conflict-era actors and their networks shape core decision regarding
resource allocation. This article examines the political economies of
resistance-era networks in the post-conflict period, focusing
specifically on the large-scale pensions programme. The article argues
that these former fighters tasked with registration verification serve
as `street level bureaucrats' and have re-shaped the programme to
reflect their views of the conflict and interests. This is not a trivial
matter - in 2015 the programme consumed 9 per cent of the national
budget - and this work suggests that pensions should be viewed as a core
aspect of post-conflict economic development in Timor-Leste and, more
broadly, that the role of conflict actors in defining such programmes is
essential to understanding redistributive policies after conflict.

N2  - The level of analysis concept is an excellent tool for studying the evolution of international relations. This article focuses on the institutional approach of three levels of interaction: the intergovernmental level (IGL) describes traditional contacts among heads of states or governments as well as among ministers; the transgovernmental level (TGL) consists of relations among civil servants of middle and low rank; and the transnational level (TNL) includes the dialogue of non-governmental participants such as business, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and epistemic communities. Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye identified TGL and TNL, but the studies of these levels has intensified as a result of burgeoning links among civil servants, business, NGOs and experts from different countries. Transgovernmental and transnational interactions stabilize relations among various actors. This article clarifies the stabilizing potential of TGL and TNL interactions. First, the degree of autonomy of civil servants from the political level of government has to be taken into account. Second, the state regulates the level of independence of both business and NGOs. TGL and TNL interactions can stabilize relations only if civil servants are independent from the political level in what concerns technical issues and where both business and civil society are strong. Third, real economic interdependence matters because it forms an agenda of cooperation in a particular field. The intensification of trade and investment flows does not automatically lead to real interdependence. In this case, contacts at the transgovernmental and transnational levels acquire a formal character and no cooperation emerges, which does not allow for stabilized relations in crisis situations at the IGL. The empirical section of the article demonstrates how widening and deepening relations between the European Union and Russia, especially since 2000, led to thickening transgovernmental and transnational interactions but these levels failed to stabilize relations between Moscow and Brussels following the 2014 Ukrainian crisis. On the contrary, the EU' s reaction (sanctions) led to the destruction of economic links at both levels, whereas Russia deconstructed transnational non-profit relations. Tensions at the IGL also negatively affected the epistemic community (a part of the TNL), leading to its politicization. Changes and fine-tunings in the concept of institutional levels of analysis, suggested in the article, help to explain recent developments in EU - Russian relations. The article also recommends purposefully restoring relations at the transgovernmental and transnational levels to facilitate overcoming of the crisis in EU - Russian relations.

N2  - Denmark and Norway have experienced significant political changes during the past three decades, changes that affect the constraints and opportunities organized interests are facing. Corporatist representation in the policy-making process has declined, and changes in executive-legislative relations have increased the power of parliaments. Organized interests are expected to adapt to these changing circumstances to maintain their political influence. This article shows how Danish and Norwegian interest groups have coped with the decline of corporatism and the revival of parliaments. Representation in corporatist policy-making committees and lobbying toward civil servants in government ministries have been supplemented and in some cases substituted by political lobbyism directed toward elected representatives in the parliament and the government. The analysis is based on panel data from several surveys carried out among nationwide interest groups in Denmark and Norway.

N2  - This article discusses how Islamic umbrella organizations advocate for civil rights of immigrants and Muslims in Germany. By focusing on the changing migration and security regimes at the turn of the twenty-first century, it analyzes the political emphasis on perceived "threats" in light of theoretical debates about the "securitization of migration", and in particular, the role of Islamic organizations as lobbyists which publicly protest against associations being made between the two policy fields. Their public protest is against provisions of the new Nationality Act (2000) and the Immigration Act (2005) that require immigrants to prove German language skills, to be able to support themselves, and to pass naturalization tests as well as against the lack of dual citizenship and local voting rights. In addressing these issues, Islamic umbrella organizations expand their traditional scope of advocacy work to achieve religious rights for Muslim individuals and organizations, such as the official recognition of Islamic umbrella organizations and the introduction of Islamic religious education in public schools.

N2  - The paper explores the role of a participatory approach in the outcome of the Finnish sustainable development indicator (SDI) exercise in 1998-2002. The process is analysed through three main objectives: to achieve stronger democracy, better quality of the end product and a more effective process. The analysis is further structured by a set of criteria needed for successful participation and differentiation of types of participants. The criteria comprise three main aspects: fairness, competence and social learning. In addition to the normally mentioned stakeholders (e.g. citizens and interest groups) participants also include experts and civil servants. Using the set of criteria above the participatory approach of the Finnish SDI process is then evaluated, and in the light of this evaluation the paper also discusses the specifications needed as evaluation criteria for national level policy programme processes like developing the SDIs. The results are based on documentation of the indicator task force meetings, written comments and a study of the putative end-users conducted after the publication of the indicators. The results show that the intense and broad participation of experts and civil servants increased the competence of the outcome and led to greater efficiency in working methods. However, this led to technocratic participation, absence of democratic participation and absence of social learning. Thus the ultimate goal of SDIs to contribute to achieving sustainability was not reached. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Restrictions on collective bargaining are spreading. But while reformers are right to question current labor practices in education, they're wrong to believe that bargaining prohibitions will solve the problems. A smarter approach would begin by putting down the sledgehammer wielded in Wisconsin and picking up a scalpel by pushing for laws aimed at two goals: (a) Clarifying or expanding the category of permissive bargaining topics, without eliminating mandatory bargaining on fundamental terms and conditions of employment; and (b) Ensuring that collective bargaining is transparent and that local government officials are accountable for their decisions in bargaining. Reformers should also focus on advocacy for policy change at the local level. © 2014.

N2  - There is persistent debate about who most influences the federal appointment process, especially whether the executive branch staffs the federal bureaucracy with individuals loyal to the White House or relies on the process as an accommodation to important political players, especially members of Congress. Yet, people still know little about the role members of Congress play in the process of shaping the prenomination environment. In this article, the authors address this debate by using unique archival data from the Dwight Eisenhower and Gerald Ford Presidential Libraries to identify which legislators contacted the president about a specific nomination or appointment request and under what conditions these requests were successful. The authors find that legislator resources, Senate membership, and those closer ideologically to the president are related both to the number of requests made and to the number of successful appointment or nomination requests granted. The results suggest that the president relies on members of Congress for credible information about staffing administrative positions, but they appoint or nominate individuals that are in their own interest, not necessarily to accommodate Congress.

N2  - The 2008 financial crisis as well as new public management reform policies questioned the professional and social status of senior civil servants in the different European countries. Comparative analysis shows that there is a certain number of focal points in all European countries. Legal training is going backward compared to economics and management training. Within the senior civil service a line has been drawn between top executive civil servants and day to day management staff. However, no major change occurred in the social structure of the senior civil service. The institutional resilience is strong. The crisis did not produced a new technocratic model of senior civil servant. Rather, it has strengthened the influence of politics.

N2  - Corporate capture is the deliberately planned process whereby political decisions respond to a particular interest of a private nature, in detriment to the public interest. The result is an unjust regulation or the absence of regulation where this is necessary for the protection of the common good. When policies affect commercial determinants of health, such as alcohol, tobacco, sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed foods, this is known as corporate capture of public health. Capture-related actions are targeted at civil society, experts, public-health officials, and politicians, and can assume different forms, ranging from material (revolving doors) to intellectual (distortion of science), social (control of information) and/or cultural (by reason of the group identity, status and relationship of the regulator with the representatives of private corporations). The capture strategies are aimed at: 1) biasing scientific results; 2) creating consumers from an early age; 3) promoting a good image of corporations; 4) questioning the legitimacy and appropriateness of governmental regulation; 5) controlling professional education; and 6) lobbying on governments and international bodies. To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyse a paradigmatic case of corporate capture of public health, namely, Spanish nutritional policies since the approval in 2005 of the «Strategy for Nutrition, Physical Activity and Prevention of Obesity (NAOS)». In Spain, a sector of the scientific community and those in charge of nutritional policies have not only succumbed to the interests of private corporations, but have also adopted the latter’s line of reasoning as their own, thereby becoming a mouthpiece for corporate interests.

N2  - The increasingly common practice of presidential appointment of so-called executive branch czars has become especially contentious in the Obama era. Much of that controversy unfortunately is highly partisan-oriented and misses the core constitutional issues at stake. In this article, we describe and analyze the Obama-era executive branch czars controversy from a constitutional analysis framework. In so doing, we offer a working definition of executive branch czars-a much-needed corrective to the current debates in which the term has been used very loosely. We examine and analyze the scope of authority exercised by the high-level executive branch officials during the Obama administration that we consider to be constitutionally troublesome. Although our focus is on the Obama czars that have vast and largely unchecked powers, we also acknowledge that some media-labeled czar positions are statutorily created and accountable and thus should not be in the same category. After addressing the Obama-era czars, we offer a set of reform proposals that provide a much-needed corrective.

N2  - This article is a double thought experiment answering to the following
questions: 1) how far one can go in explaining the dynamics of political
regimes and transitions between them on the basis of an abstract theory,
including a small number of basic categories and postulates; 2) what is
the heuristical potential of the theory in explaining the nature of
neopatrimonial regimes. The Weberian paradigm of four social spheres is
used (administrative, military, economic and ideological / cultural /
religious). These areas correspond to the social universals: power,
violence, property and symbols. When combined with a functional scheme
of A. Stinchcombe they are explicated as homeostatic variables: the main
objects of concern of social actors. The concepts of political regime,
political relations, political interaction, routine and conflict
strategies are defined. Transformation of political regime is determined
by the change in its core complex of political relations. The conditions
of a regime crisis as a conflict between actors for which the levels of
basic homeostatic variables become unacceptable (from isolation and full
domination to equal partnership and integration) are considered, as well
as the laws of formation of each such type of relationship. Patrimony as
an antithesis of bureaucracy is always reborn and enhanced by weakening
the state and its formal rules and institutions. The nature of
neopatrimonialism includes a core patrimony (the network of patronage
ties) and the declarative shell of formal democratic institutions which
are constructed on impersonal formal principles of bureaucracy.

N2  - This article examines the local socio-political causes behind a sudden wave of starvation deaths that swept across the West Bengali village of Amlashol during the summer of 2004. Following the new paradigm of famine analysis where focus is placed on political failures, the article addresses three groups of political dynamics that together contributed to the starvation deaths: (i) political triggering mechanisms; (ii) underlying political dynamics; and (iii) village specific political dynamics. The article finds that the government's escalating conflict with the Maoists turned a situation of chronic food insecurity into an acute hunger crisis, which was not mitigated by effective public policies at the local level due to extensive political patronage and a politicisation of the bureaucracy. Amlashol suffered disproportionally from this due to the village's affiliation with a weak and politically marginalised panchayat. Within Amlashol, the casualties of starvation came primarily from one particular Scheduled tribe, the Sabars, due to issues of social stigmatisation, political exclusion and eroding livelihoods. The article provides a testament to the importance of addressing disaggregated political dynamics in contemporary starvation analysis. © 2011 SAGE Publications India Private Limited.

N2  - The growth of the main universities in the city of Ibagué-Colombia, together with the high-quality accreditation process that they have been carrying out, raises the question about the degree of responsibility that these higher education institutions have with the community that surrounds them. In this sense, this manuscript presents the objective of determining the incidence of university social responsibility policies perceived by three interest groups (students, teachers and officials), of a university located in Ibagué, Colombia. The study addressed aspects related to quantitative and qualitative research, with a descriptive and explanatory scope. A sample by optimal allocation was used, consisting of 291 students and 54 teachers; In the case of civil servants, a non-probabilistic sampling was applied, corresponding to 20. As a result, it is surprising that corollaries have been obtained that show the lack of transversality of all social responsibility, which does not show, especially in students, the implementation of policies on university social responsibility, which promote social intervention in the dynamics carried out in different contexts. In conclusion, the three groups studied concentrate the interest in carrying out academic activities articulated with the needs of society

N2  - The aim of the article is to study the practice of appointing chiefs of gendarme departments in Tomsk Province over the entire existence of the gendarme department in the region. To achieve this aim, the following objectives were set: (1) to identify all the gendarme staff officers and heads of the provincial Gendarme Administration in Tomsk Province, the periods of their leadership in the gendarme unit; (2) on the basis of biographical data, to compile a social portrait of gendarme chiefs in Tomsk Province by identifying categories such as their social origin, education, official activity before entering the gendarme service and the Gendarme Corps itself, their financial situation; (3) to determine the features of the practice of appointing heads of the gendarme department in Tomsk Province; (4) to answer the question about the prestige of the gendarme service in Tomsk Province. The main sources for the article were legal acts of Russian state authorities, Gendarme Corps orders, form and service records of gendarme ranks stored in the central archives of Russia; most of them are first introduced into scientific discourse. The main methods used in the study are a prosopographic method and comparative historical analysis. During the research, the author came to the following conclusions. The position of the head of the Gendarme Administration in Tomsk Province was held by middle-aged people (the average age was 43), as a rule, personal nobility, career military men, many of whom participated in military campaigns. Most of them did not have real estate and thus service was the only source of livelihood for themselves and their families. 30 people were heads of the Gendarme Administration in Tomsk Province. The average length of service was 2 years and 8 months. The average length of service in the ranks of gendarmes before being transferred to Tomsk was 10 years and 7 months. Over time, officers with a fairly long gendarme service and leadership experience were assigned to go to Tomsk Province. The short term of service in Tomsk Province testifies to a fairly high level of staff turnover, especially at the turn of the 20th century. By the beginning of the 20th century, the status of Tomsk Province changed: a remote province became a regional administrative center and a desirable place where one could make a successful gendarme career.

N2  - Participatory budgeting (PB) has emerged as a tool for empowering marginalized communities and advancing social justice through public deliberation and advocacy. However, public deliberation scholars have contested the appropriate roles of social justice, activism, and equity. PB bridges deliberation, advocacy, and equity, as it strives to accomplish social change. We detail how the first cycle of Greensboro PB navigated tensions between residents who sought social change and government officials who wished to maintain the status quo. We argue PB is an example of public deliberation that fosters social justice sensibilities among participants and conclude with applied recommendations for design improvements.

It analyzes the role of different concepts of anti‐racism and their implications in the policy process. Data was drawn from observation, personal interviews, and analysis of archival materials. I suggest that policy‐making emerges from a fragmented coalition of NGOs, politicians and civil servants operating in connected but distinct regulative environments. Across the different sectors involved in the policy process, various conceptions of anti‐racism operate. The concept of the mainstreaming of anti‐racism acts as the dominant consolidating metaphor that guides most agenda‐setting attempts and regulatory discourse. But other definitions of the nature, causes and ideal solutions of racism co‐exist All together these conceptions give identity and professionalism to the relevant policy network, but in a fragmented and contested fashion. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - This contribution seeks to answer the question whether the new civil service legislation that entered into force in 2015 in the Czech Republic led to the depoliticization of the country's ministerial bureaucracy. To that end, we compare the career backgrounds of top civil servants before and after the entry into force of the new Civil Service Act. The article examines the career backgrounds of the persons appointed as ministerial deputies between 2013 and 2018, focusing on their last ``pre-deputy{''} jobs and considering a broader set of their career attributes. A focus on the previous job reveals that even before the law was introduced, bureaucrats constituted the largest share of appointees, and their share even increased with the new legislation. The incidence of deputies appointed directly from party-related jobs dropped considerably. However, when a broader set of career attributes is considered, the share of partisans among the pre-2015 deputies nearly matches that of the career bureaucrats. Ostensibly political careers among the post-2015 deputies declined but remain significant. Hence, there has been a decline in the open politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy after 2015. Party political effects also matter, as the new ANO party, after entering the executive, has taken a different approach to top bureaucratic appointments than the other major governing Czech parties. Typically, deputies appointed into the positions under the ANO's control would not have links to the party itself but would be recruited via non-party channels, e.g. from pre-political networks of the ANO ministers and leaders. Consequently, though less politicized by party agents, the current Czech system is more a product of choices made by government ministers of the day than a stable arrangement resulting from firmly established norms and rules.

N2  - Background The establishment of a regulated legal market for new psychoactive substances (NPS, ‘legal highs’) under New Zealand's Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA) 2013 created a new commercial sector for psychoactive products, previously limited to alcohol and tobacco. Aim To explore how the newly-recognised ‘legal high’ industry (LHI) viewed and responded to the changing regulatory and market environment. Methods In-depth interviews with six key informants (KI) from the LHI: a leading entrepreneur, chemist, industry spokesperson, retailer, product buyer and a researcher commissioned by the LHI – were conducted, transcribed and analysed thematically. Formative work for the study included review of official LHI documents (websites, public submissions, self-regulation documents). Results The LHI stakeholders espoused an idealistic mission of shifting recreational users of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs towards “safer alternatives”. Passage of the PSA was viewed as a success after years of lobbying led by pioneering LHI actors. The growth and professionalisation of the LHI resulted in an increasingly commercial market which challenged idealistic views of the original operators. LHI KI reported the targeting of young and low income customers, price cutting and increasing the strength of products as business strategies. Attempts by the LHI to self-regulate did not prevent escalation in the strength of products and fall in retail prices. The LHI reported outsourcing of manufacturing and exporting of their products to other countries, demonstrating an international business model. Conclusion There was a tension between profit and idealistic motivations within the LHI and this increased as the sector became more commercialised. While the LHI distanced itself from both alcohol and tobacco, they reported the use of similar marketing, business and political lobbying strategies. Rules for engagement with new ‘addictive consumption industries’ are required to clarify the role they are permitted to play in the development of regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances.

N2  - "Public law litigation" - civil rights advocacy seeking to restructure public agencies has changed course over the last three decades. It has moved away from remedial intervention modeled on command-and-control bureaucracy toward a kind of intervention that can be called "experimentalist." Instead of top-down, fixed-rule regimes, the experimentalist approach emphasizes ongoing stakeholder negotiation, continuously revised performance measures, and transparency. Experimentalism is evident in all the principal areas of public law intervention - schools, mental health institutions, prisons, police, and public housing. This development has been substantially unanticipated and unnoticed by both advocates and critics of public law litigation. In this Article, we describe the emergence of the experimentalist model and argue that it moots many common criticisms of public law litigation. We further suggest that it implies answers to some prominent doctrinal issues, including the limits on judicial discretion in enforcing public law rights and the constraints entailed by separation-of-powers norms. Our interpretation understands public law cases as core instances of "destabilization rights" - rights to disentrench an institution that has systematically failed to meet its obligations and remained immune to traditional forces of political correction. It suggests reasons why judicial recognition and enforcement of such rights might be both effective in inducing better compliance with legal obligations and consistent with our structure of government.

N2  - Several scholars observe presidential appointment as a principal mechanism for the president to influence the bureaucracy in the United States. In order to study presidential influence on the Federal Reserve Board, which is widely considered to be one of the most independent governmental agencies, this article examines the influences of the Chairs and Governors of the Board appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents separately on monetary policy. The results show a significant impact of the presidential appointment of the Fed Chair, but not of the Governors. Also, when presidential popularity is declining, the serving president is likely to influence the Fed to stimulate the economy and improve his popular standing. However, this politically-motivated influence is present only under the Fed Chair appointed by the serving president, but not under the Chair appointed by the previous president.

N2  - Does the Norwegian political landscape indicate advocacy of binding international carbon storage commitments in the foreseeable future? Norway's unique geology has understandably prompted a particular interest in the subject. This article analyses the interests and relative influence of the key domestic actors (the oil industry, environmental organizations, political parties and government bureaucracy) who wield influence in policy-making processes concerning carbon dioxide storage. Despite the level of interest aroused by the issue in Norway, the evidence suggests that policy will not move in the direction of an international carbon storage agreement. This is mainly because Norwegian policy-making in the field is dominated by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, whose current interests do not seem compatible with such a position. The fact that carbon storage can be developed in accordance with Norway's interests as a petroleum producer may, however, be a decisive factor for the political parties, government bureaucracy and the oil industry in the future.

N2  - This chapter describes the interest-group politics of France and Germany with that of the United States; deals with the heavily institutionalized nature of the relationship between groups and governments in these two European countries; and discusses the implications of such a relationship for democracy and public policy. There is no evidence that the institutionalized contacts between government and interest-group leaders have resulted either in an irreversible interpenetration or in a form of elite management in which the various members of this elite have interchangeable values. In the US, interest groups have not been "incorporated" into the official authority structure or the political parties and hence have retained their autonomy vis-a-vis both. Such autonomy has contributed to the maintenance of a functional distinction between the "articulation structure" on the one hand and the aggregation and central decision-making structures on the other and has also contributed to keeping the US political system close to a once popular model of modernity and democracy.

N2  - Policymakers, practitioners, and academics around the world make compelling arguments for bridging public and private sectors through alliance, collaboration, and partnership. Based on the logic of pragmatism, they cast these arrangements as innovative and resourceful ways of dealing with the intensifying demands of urbanization. Infrastructure policy specialists in particular, citing a combination of economic and institutional forces, emphasize the central role public-private partnerships (PPPs) can play in meeting the pressing need for new large-scale investments and the equally urgent need to refurbish existing systems. Construction engineering experts support the paradigm shift as a new way to solve particular problems in contracting for large-scale construction projects.1 For governments and international donor organizations eager to enhance productivity and stimulate economic growth, PPPs represent an efficient means to expand the scope of their development investments while securing advanced technological expertise. The driver of change, typically, is financial. Worldwide, governments face fiscal constraints from limited (or cash-starved) budgets and heightened voter sensitivity to taxes. For the past several decades, fiscal pressures have prompted government officials to experiment with innovative approaches to the intense technical challenges of planning, designing, financing, and executing large-scale infrastructure projects for the development and delivery of urban services. The ensuing big-three PPP formats - asset-sale privatization, contracting out, and cooperative or joint venture agreements - comprise an alphabet-soup list of acronyms affording public officials diverse alternatives to the traditional public-sector procurement model, which many experts benchmark as bureau-cratically inefficient and costly. The worldwide momentum for PPPs has emerged from the support of a broad and diverse coalition that sees the strategy as a reform of urban governance as much as a pragmatic fiscal imperative. Complex urban problems and a better quality of urban services, policy reformers argue, are no longer solvable solely by traditional state intervention. Multifaceted approaches are required, including new institutional arrangements that devolve power from the national center to local government and reinvent government by engaging the private market to deliver urban services in cooperation or competition with public agencies (Osborne and Gaebler 1993; Moore and Pierre 1998; Engberg 2002). International funding organizations like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the Inter-American Development Bank have entered the PPP advocacy tent, seeking to promote and expand the development of needed infrastructure around the world (USFHWA 2007a). And relatively recently, the European Union (EU) accepted the PPP as a "complementary implementation tool," linking PPP use to its initiatives for economic development and competitiveness (EC 2004; EC 2003; Newman and Verpraet 1999; Elander 2002; Grimsey and Lewis 2004).2 In the U.S., the Department of Transportation, through its surface transportation administrations, aims to expedite urban transportation projects by encouraging state and local transportation agencies to consider the "selective use" of PPP approaches (USFHWA 2007b, 4-2). On the political front, some leading politicians have adopted PPPs as a central tool of governance within their ruling party's wider "modernization" agenda, as did Labour's Tony Blair when he became prime minister of the UK in 1997 (Flinders 2005). In short, the collaborative approach of the PPP paradigm theoretically affords government several strategic advantages, albeit with a trade-off: growing unease over traditional public-sector values that seem to get jettisoned on the path to collaboration. Policymakers have fed upon the optimism about PPPs to accelerate applications to broad and diverse urban problems across the globe. Between 1985 and 2004, worldwide PPP infrastructure projects worth more than $2 billion had been planned and funded, with 53 percent of them completed by the end of 2004 (USFHWA 2007a). In some countries, PPP has been an experimental innovation (Netherlands, Spain, Finland); in others, an ideological force (United Kingdom, Canada, Australia); and in still others, a variant on a history of mixed enterprise (United States, France, Singapore). PPP slogans often reveal these political drivers: "A New Framework for Infrastructure" (Asian Development Bank et al. 2005); "PFI: Meeting the Investment Challenge" (HM Treasury 2003); "Partnerships for Progress" (National Council for Public Private Partnerships 1998); "Working Together" (Farlam 2005). Whether for urban redevelopment/regeneration, transportation and environmental infrastructure, housing and homelessness, hospitals, schools, or economic development, the PPP model and its many variants has become the policy of choice for municipal government in the U.S., and an increasing number of countries in Europe and Asia. As practiced today, public-private collaboration marks a broad convergence of current economic forces and changing political paradigms. For the public sector, PPPs symbolize the search for greater efficiency of urban service delivery and resourceful mobilization of private capital to ease financial constraints and strengthen weak fiscal positions. For the private sector, PPPs represent an economic cornucopia of potential opportunity in urban markets across the globe. Evidence of the strategy's effectiveness is not extensive (though it is growing) relative to the number of PPP initiatives, and what exists is mixed (Daniels and Trebilcock 1996; Boase 2000; Public Citizen 2003; HM Treasury 2003; Flinders 2005; Siemiatycki 2006; Koppenjan 2005; Murray 2006; Cambridge Systematics 2006; USFHWA 2007a, 2007b). I can offer several (less than satisfying) explanations for this state of affairs. First, a PPP project takes a long time to execute before data can be marshaled for evaluation, and the full implications of performance may not even be understood for many years after a project's completion. Second, in the absence of a statutory or administrative mandate or a political decision to repurchase a concession or provide a subsidy, government stakeholders do not have strong motivation to undertake ex post evaluations that might reveal disappointing results or embarrassing and costly construction overruns. Third, the information needed to assess performance of a PPP project is, more often than not, confidential. Fourth, because each project has a nearly unique set of complexities, general lessons are hard to come by (Sagalyn 1990, 2007), especially from experiences in emerging market economies. Nevertheless, experience with PPPs in the U.S., Europe, and Asia has consistently brought to the fore common issues of governance, which are the focal point of this chapter. These public policy concerns are not particular to the PPP model, but the political rhetoric and elevated expectations for performance from cooperative (as opposed to adversarial) sector relationships add tension to the issues of accountability. In so doing, they amplify the political risks of adopting the PPP model as a governance reform. In this chapter, I describe the coordinates of the global application of PPP and identify central commonalities of sector collaboration for both infrastructure development and urban redevelopment/ regeneration projects. The comparison across these two types of "hard" asset-based initiatives will, I hope, highlight the central issues of implementation and underscore the need for policymakers to address the nature of risk sharing, which I believe is central to the PPP strategy at the project level. It should also provide an understanding of how weak management of accountability concerns is likely to intensify the political risks of the PPP strategy.

N2  - Lipsky's seminal concept of street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) focuses on their role as public servants. However, in the course of new modes of governance, private actors have gained an additional role as implementation agents. We explore the logic of private SLBs during the implementation of the Swiss Ordinance on Veterinary Medicinal Products (OVMP) where veterinarians are simultaneously implementing agents, policy addressees, and professionals with economic interests. We argue that, because of contradictory reference systems, it is problematic for the output performance if an actor is simultaneously the target group of a policy and its implementing agent.

N2  - Antibureaucratic attitudes and ideas, distilled in the pejorative and untranslatable term fonctionnarisme, permeated political culture in late nineteenth-century France. Reacting to a rapid development of state employment, critics saw colonial expansion as a spillover effect of metropolitan administrative hypertrophy. Indochina was singled out in particular as a "colony of functionaries," serving more as a job creation program for French "déclassés" than as a beacon of French grandeur. Criticism centered on the filling of government positions through political patronage, a system at which Indochina excelled. The state employee majority among the colony's French population likewise produced political distortions that cemented Indochina's reputation for bureaucratic excess and motivated reform efforts for decades. The well-known ascendancy of association policy in this period, which focused on Indochina, was primarily driven by the conflation of assimilation and direct administration with fonctionnarisme. Antibureaucratic ideology thus came to constitute an influential force shaping French politics in both metropole and empire.

N2  - Drawing on ethnographic research across two street-level bureaucratic institutions in Istanbul, Turkey in the late 2010s, this paper traces the causes and implications of the politicisation of bureaucrats in the context of authoritarianisation. It argues that politicisation of bureaucrats cannot solely be taken as a reflection of the erosion of bureaucratic autonomy and capacity but must be explored further to reveal how bureaucrats cope with authoritarian pressure as well socio-legal destabilisations to preserve their institutional ethos. To this aim, I demonstrate how bureaucrats get politicised in response to authoritarian policies and, in turn, labour to uphold the rule of law despite politico-legal risks. The paper particularly focuses on how bureaucrats weave political solidarity and circulate anti-government discourses and how they use their knowledge of the legal-regulatory repertoire and archives to deter and `correct' unlawful practices through their everyday work. The paper generates insights into the fashionings of political subjectivities and agency by bureaucrats through their labouring in the face of authoritarian interventions, legal disruptions and the increasing interactions with the citizenry. In doing this, my objective is to shed light on the everyday workings of authoritarian state and to get a better picture of the way the law is `made real' (Latour, 2002) across mundane encounters between bureaucrats and the citizenry.

N2  - No one can deny the importance of policy advice in the affairs of the government but the actual role played by consultants in policymaking is poorly understood and little researched, particularly in developing countries where data are scarce. This article is an initial attempt at examining the demand for policy consulting in a developing country. It sought to confirm whether the trends in policy advice–externalization and proceduralization–found in developed countries are present in an emerging economy such as the Philippines based on an extensive coding and analysis of a recently made public database of bid notices for consulting services. The study confirms that the demand for external policy advice is growing in Philippines, as expected from a government of a developing country. The proceduralization hypothesis of externalizing process-related work is partially confirmed but strategic policy advice is also found to be important where the government almost equally also outsources substantive, highly specialized advice. However, administrative politicization is not observed in this data set. A new category of advice is also generated–training–to capture demands of the bureaucracy to delivery advice expeditiously through workshops facilitated by experts.

N2  - Corruption represents a major leakage of public fund in many countries in the world. It has been highlighted that the involvement of unnecessary lobbying in the procurement contributes to the corruption. As a result, the Malaysian government has introduced the E-Procurement System to improve its services and to promote transparency in the procurement processes. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the E-procurement system in reducing the lobbyist involvement in one of the largest statutory bodies in Malaysia. For this qualitative study, five procurement officers and three suppliers who had been using the system since it was implemented in the year 2011 were interviewed. Document review was also performed to access information on the processes in the system in support of the feedback from the respondents. The interview results showed that the E-procurement system was effectively implemented in largest statutory body (ACED) and reduced the involvement of lobbyist in the procurement processes. Both groups of informants agreed that the E-procurement system was an effective mechanism to curb procurement fraud because the processes were automated and transparent at every stage. Each process was conducted by a different person and it promoted integrity and transparency in the system. The E-Procurement System was found to be effective in preventing direct communication between the procurement officers and suppliers, therefore reducing the risk of lobbying. The E-procurement System was also bound by specific laws and regulations governing both parties, to which they must comply. The present study concludes that the system can reduce the unethical behaviour by lobbyist and that it should be implemented.

N2  - In many countries, attempts to suppress scientists as public experts have become more prevalent. In democratic countries, environmental scientists have been a particular focus of control. This article looks at structures and mechanisms of suppression of government researchers. It is based on a qualitative analysis of ten in-depth interviews with environmental researchers being employed or engaged in government science. The analysis is influenced by a power-theoretical perspective on the suppression of science. By analyzing the interviewees' accounts, it scrutinizes the different ways in which political and economic control can trickle down in research organizations such as state research institutes and come to affect individual researchers. The focus is especially on the interlinking of political and economic influence of external actors with different forms and practices of control at the organizational level. Three forms of such trickle-down are identified and discussed: internalization of political and economic control, external influencing and bureaucratic control, and economic/interest group influence in research organizations. We argue that these forms of control function as a filtering layer of suppression between political and economic control and individual scientists out of the public eye regarding government science.

N2  - In this unusually candid book, Japan's former top financial diplomat asserts the urgent need for wholesale structural reform to revitalize the long-stagnant Japanese economy. Eisuke Sakakibara, whose influence over global currency markets earned him the nickname of "Mr. Yen," envisions a social and economic revolution that encompasses all sectors of Japanese society. Whereas previous analyses of Japanese policies of the past decade focus narrowly on such issues as nonperforming assets and deregulation, Sakakibara provides a new perspective. Japan's economic problems are structural, rather than cyclical, according to Sakakibara. Profitable investment opportunities are hard to find in the dysfunctional corporate sector, where costs are high and income continues to decline. The country's entrenched power elite ?the Liberal Democratic Party, the bureaucracy, and vested interest groups ?are threatened by reform efforts. It will be difficult to restore economic health to Japan until its political leaders are able to break the grip of this "iron triangle" and implement aggressive, widespread reforms. This book furthers the understanding that structural reform or new institution building in Japan needs an all-encompassing approach that includes the various sectors of Japanese society and the economy. Only with this kind of understanding can pragmatic and meaningful structural reform in Japan be implemented. ©2003 The Brookings Institution. All rights reserved.

N2  - The Northern Caucasus is home to over 100 peoples who belong to numerous tribes, teips, tukums, families, clans, pressure groups, etc. It is a polyethnic and polyconfessional region, in which the interests of the federal administrative, and local political elites are closely intertwined. Life has taught us that in this context ethnopolitical clashes and contradictions can hardly be avoided. Here I analyze the political elites as the key actor in the regional political process that is gradually gaining weight at the federal level. Any analysis of the threats and risks in the Caucasus pays particular attention to the ethnopolitical elites and their stratification as one of the important factors. This suggests that the structure and place of the political elites in the Northern Caucasus, the mechanism of their formation, as well as axiological attitudes and aims should be carefully studied. Indeed, one cannot but wonder about those who belong to the group of the chosen ones and the way they replenish their ranks. The article analyzes the opinion that the current quality and structure of the elites is fraught with regional conflicts and tension. To identify the elites, the author selects a reputational approach and has correlated it with the altimetric and decisional approaches. I describe the ethnopolitical elite as a privileged and politically dominating group of people that occupies the leading position in public institutions and directly affects decision-making. The expert community has still not arrived at a concerted opinion about the role of ethnic elites in the political processes in theregion.1 Some experts are convinced that the local elites play a positive role in defusing national tension, containing local conflicts, promoting civilian dialog, etc. Others tend to think that the ethnopolitical elites pursue their own interests, haggle with the federal elite over subsidies and interest zones, and play a destructive role in the political process. I side with the latter: the ethnopolitical elites of the Northern Caucasus are biased; they function on an informal patron client basis instead of listening to the opinions of the people and following them.2This article gives recommendations on how to defuse ethnopolitical tension in the Northern Caucasus. © 2016, CA and CC Press AB.

N2  - In recent years a voluminous literature has appeared attempting to characterize the patterns of relationships between the Washington representatives of private interests-lobbyists in the broadest sense of that term-and the government officials with whom they interact in their pursuit of favorable public policy. Much of this literature is in the form of case studies of particular interest groups, governmental agencies, or specific policy decisions. Some of it rests on a broader sampling of observations from one or more of these three sources. Whatever the research foundation may have been, both normative and empirical judgments about this relationship abound in textbooks and other summary treatments. © 1992 Taylor and Francis.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential of forest owners associations (FOAs) to influence forest policymaking using power theory. Firstly, the paper examines the concept of power and the political power of interest groups. Interest groups seek to be able to use their power through Influencing policy outcomes and framing the underlying dimensions that define policy issues. In the next step the paper defines factors of dispositional political power: formal, informal, internal, and external. Formal factors are primarily based constitutionally or legislatively and are ensured through the right to associate and form associations to advocate common interests. Informal factors represent the abilities of interest groups to operate in the political process. Internal factors represent the ability of interest groups to work within the group and external factors represent the behaviour towards other associations, government, non-governmental organisations, etc. Semi-structured questionnaires to former and present FOAs officials were used containing questions about the basic role of FOAs as they can be found in the scientific literature. The crucial internal factor limiting the dispositional power of FOAs is the lack of financial resources for providing services or necessary apparatus, which might strongly hinder the fulfilment and achievement of set goals in policymaking. The disinterest of the state bureaucracy towards non-state forests also limits FOAs' dispositional power. The most important external factor from the officials' perspective is the disinterest of the state bureaucracy towards non-state forests at the sectoral and cross-sectoral level. There is a common agreement between FOA officials that current strategies and tactics in the form of dialogue are inefficient. FOAs are considered as a partner in policy formulation, but their actual political power is low, due to the disunity among FOA leaders and ineffective strategies and tactics.

N2  - This article investigates the involvement of permanent civil servants in strategic communication in government organizations within the context of mediatized democracies. Based upon an argument that the involvement in strategic communication is to be seen as part and parcel of a functional politicization of the civil service, the article identifies a significant and positive relationship between media awareness and functional politicization across the ministerial hierarchy as well as between media pressure and functional politicization, although moderated by organizational level and position. Based upon these empirical findings, the article demonstrates how strategic communication for pursuing and achieving political ends in central governments involves a permanent civil service aware of and positioned in organizations subject to pressures from the news media. The article discusses how these findings relate to different perspectives on strategic communication in central government organizations and identifies the need for mediatization research to re-emphasize central government organizations as organizations in their own right but just as importantly as an instrument for governments. Furthermore, the article points out the relevance for including non-elected actors into the research on political communication from politicians once elected into offices. The empirical analysis is performed in the context of Danish central government organizations. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

T1  - Are Bankruptcy Judges Unconstitutional? An Appointments Clause Challenge

N2  - The Appointments Clause permits Congress to opt out of the Article II procedure of presidential nomination and Senate advice and consent by vesting the appointment of ``inferior officers{''} in ``the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.{''} Congress exercised this option when it vested the power to appoint bankruptcy judges in the United States Courts of Appeals, implicitly categorizing these judges as ``inferior officers{''} and thereby exposing a potential Achilles' heel. Although the Courts of Law have appointed bankruptcy adjudicators since the earliest bankruptcy laws, this Article advances the position that bankruptcy judges have gradually accrued tenure, safeguards against removal, expansive jurisdiction, and duties that are incompatible with inferior officer status under the balancing approach of Morrison v. Olson. Accordingly, they are not amenable to being opted out of advice and consent, and they must be appointed pursuant to the default Article II procedure. The appointments of present bankruptcy judges are consequently suspect, and their judgments and orders are of questionable validity. An Article II challenge has escaped the attention of academic commentators and (largely) that of the courts. Resolution of the challenge will require the Supreme Court to clarify its Appointments Clause jurisprudence. This Article argues that the Court's pronouncements on inferior officers in Morrison and Edmond v. United States are irreconcilable. Which authority controls likely would dictate the outcome of any challenge. Accordingly, the Court must either acknowledge that Justice Scalia's majority opinion in Edmond has overruled its landmark decision in Morrison, or declare unconstitutional the present method of appointing bankruptcy judges. Thus, the challenge could be similar in scale to the Court's 1982 Marathon decision, which struck down, on separation-of-powers grounds, the bankruptcy courts' key jurisdictional provision. Beyond charting a roadmap to the challenge, this Article suggests legislative remedies that could save bankruptcy judges from an Appointments Clause challenge. But, were the Court to resolve the challenge by abandoning Morrison in favor of Edmond, this Article suggests two policy implications: bankruptcy judges could be granted Article III tenure while retaining their present methods of appointment, and all inferior court Article III judges could be appointed in the same manner.

N2  - In the federal government, over one thousand positions exist that require nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. For many of these positions, the statute creating the office contains limitations on whom the President may appoint to the office. These limitations can include simple professional qualifications, policy-based restrictions, and political party balance requirements. Although such restrictions on the pool of individuals eligible for any given office have been used since the first Congress, are ubiquitous throughout the U.S. Code, and have never been successfully challenged in court, several authors, litigants, and executive officials have identified potential constitutional concerns regarding their validity. Limitations on the President's nomination power, it is argued, should be suspect under the separation of powers set up by the U.S. Constitution as a congressional encroachment on an executive prerogative. In this Note, I examine the constitutional issues surrounding statutory limitations on appointments, present the traditional arguments for and against them, and suggest a paradigm shift for how we think about such limitations that may allay the constitutional concerns of their critics.

N2  - Problem Statement: In centralized, bureaucratically structured education systems, school principals are generally appointed bureaucrats, expected to comply with rules and regulations. Their duties and responsibilities are regulated by legislations. Public school principals, in North Cyprus, too are appointed bureaucrats. Thus, they are expected to exert `initiation of structure' in their work environment rather than `consideration'. However, the current trends force them to exert both type of behaviors; While the first requiring them to carry out day to day duties and responsibilities, the latter requiring consideration for human needs and relations. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the study is to survey leadership behaviors (consideration and initiation of structure) of public elementary and secondary school principals as perceived by public school teachers; to investigate the difference between public elementary and secondary school teachers' perceptions of their school principals' leadership behaviors; draw conclusions related to bureaucratic structures of schools and leadership behaviors of school principals; and make recommendations for further studies. The study is unique as it is the first of its kind done in North Cyprus and is expected to initiate studies in the field of educational administration, management and leadership which may lead to changes in the education system towards global needs. Methods: The study is a mixed research possessing characteristics of both quantitative and qualitative research. It employs The Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) to collect qualitative data. Quantitative data is collected by a semi-structured interview with school principals. Five hundred and ninety nine participants (n = 599) took part in the study. Ten public school principals, 2 from each district, were selected randomly to be interviewed. Conclusions and Recommendations: In a globalized context, education systems are moving more towards flexibility and autonomy, so school principals need to exert both `initiation of structure' and `consideration' behaviors. Besides the requirements of their bureaucratic positions, they should address diverse individual interests, needs and wants of the group they are managing. Therefore, a more consultative, participatory and inclusionary leadership is needed to meet the needs of the teachers, parents, learners and the community. Further research may focus on issues such as what public school principals see as major barriers in the operation of their schools and achievement of quality student learning; and the inefficiencies and inadequacies in institutional operations resulting from bureaucracy that may cause teacher job dissatisfaction and low student achievement.

N2  - Democracies in search of ways to prevent the halting of accountability and answerability would be well served by gazing into the mirror of the paradoxical and uneven trajectory of transparency in Mexico. A decade ago Mexico was featured by many as a paradigmatic example of institutional engineering for accountability, including sophisticated constitutional reforms creating regulatory and oversight agencies, freedom of information provisions and citizen empowerment. But in spite of these formal achievements, the country has in fact become an example of bureaucratization, over-politicization and the watering-down of accountability. Many expected the emergence of vigorous political competition over the last two decades in Mexico to have a positive impact on corruption and accountability. But this has not been the case since competition between political parties has not translated into better oversight or an improved equilibrium between social interests and government institutions. In this chapter, I will explore the details of this process in order to learn how best to understand, define and practice transparency in a way that prevents the “freezing” of democratization processes in the developing world. If new democracies are unable to demonstrate that they are more effective and accountable than the previous authoritarian systems, democracy and elections are put at risk. In addition, transparency, like democracy, is a “politically contested” concept that can be interpreted and practiced in a variety of ways.

N2  - This paper argues that the use of biometrics by the State's to control migration can be conceived of as a form of biopower in a Foucauldian sense. By way of example, the case of Argentina from 2003 to 2015 will be qualitatively analyzed. Based on rulings and addresses by government officials three main questions will be answered: What is the role of biometrics in recent Argentine public policies? How does it attain such status? How is biometrics adopted as a policy option for migration control? Argentina proves to be a useful case in that it has recently changed its migration policies, linking the discourse on human rights with the advocacy of migration controls based on biometrics.

N2  - Today, 70 percent of the American public supports reforms that would limit the number of terms a state legislator may serve, and the organization U.S. Term Limits advocates for this reform at the national level as well. But do term limits actually ensure that citizens dedicated to the common good-rather than self-serving career politicians-run government, as advocates claim? Or does the enforced high rate of turnover undermine the legislature’s ability to function, as opponents assert? Marjorie Sarbaugh-Thompson and Lyke Thompson bring 13 years of intensive research and 460 interviews to assess changes that have occurred since Michigan’s implementation of term limits in 1993 and explore the implications of those changes for government and governing. Paying special attention to term limits’ institutional effects, they also consider legislative representation, political accountability, and the role of the bureaucracy and interest groups in state legislatures. Their thorough study suggests that legislators are less accessible to officials and that there is a larger gap between legislators and their voters. Moreover, legislators become much more politically ambitious after term limits and spend more time on political activities rather than policy making. At the institutional level, top chamber leaders appear to gain clout. The selection of these leaders is complicated by newcomers’ lack of knowledge about and experience working with the leaders they select-a vote they make before being sworn in. As a result, term limits in Michigan fail to deliver on many of the “good government” promises that appeal to citizens. Implementing Term Limits makes a unique and valuable contribution to the debate over the best means by which to obtain truly democratic institutions.

N2  - In November 2007, Senator Barack Obama announced his intention, if elected president, to appoint a federal chief technology officer (CTO). He also identified several specific areas of responsibility of the CTO including transparency of government operations, computer and network security (sometimes referred to as cybersecurity), identification and adoption of best technologies and practices by federal agencies, and interoperability of emergency communications technologies for first responders. On April 18, 2009, President Obama appointed Virginia Secretary of Technology Aneesh P. Chopra to serve in the newly created position of federal chief technology officer. In announcing the appointment, the president indicated that Mr. Chopra would undertake roles beyond what might be considered traditional CTO responsibilities, including promoting technological innovation to help the United States create jobs, reduce health care costs, protect the homeland, and address other national goals. Mr. Chopra will serve as assistant to the president and chief technology officer, and will also hold the position of associate director for technology in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Under a provision of Executive Order 13500, issued on February 5, 2009, he will also serve as a member of the White House Domestic Policy Council in his capacity as assistant to the president and CTO. The CTO may face a variety of challenges in executing the mission envisioned by the President. Among the early challenges will be negotiating domains of responsibilities within the White House and with executive branch agencies that have overlapping missions. Some commentators have expressed concerns about the impact the creation of a CTO might have on existing offices and agencies with respect to the allocation and coordination of authorities and responsibilities. Others commentators have asserted that a high-level CTO could serve as an advocate for technological innovation and foster increased knowledge sharing among federal agencies to more effectively implement information technology solutions to meet disparate mission requirements. Mr. Chopra’s appointment as both CTO and associate director for technology at OSTP may address, in part, questions related to mission alignment, coordination, and integration. Congress may elect to provide a statutory foundation for the CTO, define the roles and authorities of the CTO, authorize and appropriate funds, provide for oversight, and address other aspects of the position. President Obama has not indicated whether he intends to seek legislation to create a statutory foundation for the CTO position.

Bangladesh is no exception. This article reviews various experiments in local government reforms in Bangladesh and analyzes the relevant issues from a political economy perspective. Despite considerable efforts made over the years no effective and viable local government system has emerged in Bangladesh. Central control through local bureaucracy and the politicization of the management of local government affairs have been systematic phenomena.

N2  - Public accountability is a fundamental element of good governance. All countries all over the world strive to ensure the accountability of public officials by adopting different kinds of mechanisms. Following the liberal democratic tradition, most countries in the world have relied on the legislative instruments, executive means, judicial and quasi-judicial processes, official rules, codes of conducts, official hierarchies, public hearings, interest groups, media scrutiny and so forth for ensuring public accountability. However, in recent years, the new mode of public governance has brought new dimensions to the discourse on public accountability. This new mode focuses largely on the market- and society-centered mechanisms. This article is an attempt to assess the effectiveness of these market- and society-centered mechanisms in ensuring public accountability in Bangladesh. The article has the following objectives: (a) to explore contemporary debates on the market- and society-centered mechanisms of public accountability; (b) to sketch the state of public accountability in Bangladesh; and (c) to analyze the effectiveness of the market- and society-centered mechanisms in view of the contemporary socio-economic and political dynamics of Bangladesh.

N2  - From the end of 16th Century, Madrid, as the home of the court and the main recipient of the landed revenues of the monarchy, aristocracy and Church , rapidly increased in size and attracted huge migration, thereby becoming a significant consumption market and financial center. Those who migrated set up complex social networks as well as hospitals and brotherhoods for mutual help. One of those, the Congregacion de San Fermin de los Navarros, linked those coming from Navarre, who held important positions in commerce, banking and royal bureaucracy through strong kinship and patronage networks. The building of a new church for the fraternity shows up the strong economic position of its members. Several internal debates point out how consistent the reciprocal relationship was between these brotherhoods and the close but separate neighborhoods fo the Navarrese and Basque communities in Madrid.

N2  - As one of the main pillars of support for Stalin's regime, the Soviet state security organs had a prominent role in both the state authority's and the Party's nomenklatura system. The principle of the nomenklatura system - to establish the control of Party organs over the appointment of leading cadres - was introduced in the Estonian SSR immediately aft er its annexation in 1940. This article considers the development of the nomenklatura of the state security organs at the Union republic level, the implementation of the nomenklatura system, and the role of the state security organs in this on the basis of the example of the Estonian SSR in the years 1940-53. It clearly appears that changes in the composition of the nomenklatura, yet also in the individuals filling posts that belonged to the nomenklatura were as a rule initiated not in Estonia but in Moscow in the CPSU Central Committee and in the headquarters of the state security organs. Here the role of the Estonian SSR Party apparat was formal. For this reason, essentially no rights emerged for the Estonian SSR Party apparat to appoint state security leaders to their posts nor did any patron-client relationships develop. In actuality, the role of the Estonian SSR Party apparat was limited to that of the informer and - if necessary - of the institution that had to answer for any conceivable consequences. The strictness with which Estonian Party authorities followed the nomenklatura system depended primarily on what the attitude and regulations of the CPSU Central Committee were at any given moment in relation to this matter. When the order came from Moscow to follow the nomenklatura system more strictly, that is just what was done. With isolated exceptions, non-Estonian cadre officers sent to Estonia from the Soviet Union formed the personnel subject to nomenklatura in the state security organs of the Estonian SSR. The fact that the state security organs carried out background checks not only on their own nomenklatura officials but also on those of other agencies, including those in the Party apparat, increased the independence of the state security organs even further. Considering the centralization and dictator-like control with which the state security organs were run, this was also most likely the intentional policy of the Kremlin, meaning that patronage relationships between the local Party and the leadership of the state security organs were considered undesirable. Instead, rivalry and denunciations were preferred. It appears that the state security agency also did not welcome or encourage actual intervention by the EC(b)P Central Committee in their cadre work. When the situation became problematic, it was always possible to refer to the covert nature of the state security organs. The fact that the approval of the heads of state security had to come from Moscow also essentially gave them independence in relation to the local administration, including Party authority.

N2  - The rise of conservative populism in Canada is evident with the election of Stephen Harper and the Conservative leadership race. Aspects of those campaigns are focused on a fear of otherness, a resentment of elites (including bureaucrats), and an emphasis on self-interest This paper will focus on populist policies and actions introduced during Stephen Harper's tenure in government Many of these policies were directed specifically towards the public service including the reduction of public servants, unilateral changes to labour laws, and the politicization of the public service through a proposed niqab ban. While the influence of populist conservative policies caused noticeable resentments between public servants and the Conservative Party, public servants should reconsider their position within democracy as not focused on their compatibility with the government of the day, but rather with their adherence to the values of inclusion, fairness, and neutrality. The public service must constantly adapt to the will of the political branch of government including more populist governments; however these core values should be celebrated through active implementation and leadership to aid in the development of a positive relationship with both the political arm of government and the public more broadly. These values provide a means for individual public servants to invest their motivation into values that they can treat as fundamental to their role in democracy.

N2  - The recent developments at economic, social, and political level have only shown the obvious need of reform which is reflected in all Romanian areas, including in the public administration sector. This is because the public administration as part of the state is submitted to a transformation process as a result of the influences exerted by various factors such as: the politicization, European integration, decentralization, each of these factors has effects at local and national level. The politicization of public administration prevents the reform process of civil service, having negative repercussions on public administration activity, considering that through the civil servants there are represented and managed the interests of local, regional and national communities. Removing politics from the administration will allow officials to perform their job duties in good faith and it will increase their orientation towards the needs of citizens, as the public administration has to serve the general interest and not the interests of different parties that have the power at a certain time. Even if there is a link between politics and administration, it must be strictly limited to a certain level and not covering the whole body of civil servants.

N2  - French political scientists have neglected school public policies. The
main studies so far are due to foreign political scientists or, since
the nineties, to sociologists and historians. The latter insist on the
development of neo-managerial forms of school governance and the
resistances they cause, but they tend to focus on the grassroot level
and on the effects of public policies and reforms on pupils'
performances in terms of social inequalities. Without denying interest
to this perspective, this paper focuses on the question of the
``problematization{''} of school issues as Michel Foucault defined it,
ie a ``set of discursive or nondiscursive practices that makes something
enter into the play of the true and false, and constitutes it as an
object for thought{''}. Such a way of analyzing school reforms implies
paying more attention to high civil servants, experts, political
parties, trade-unions, and various interest groups and their fights to
impose a new conception of the main function of School.

N2  - In the early days of the new millennium, representatives from the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan (FEPC) approached Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members behind the scenes. They requested a hearing on a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)-sponsored bill that would force power companies to develop renewable energy sources for on-grid consumption at a time when rising electricity prices, difficulties in securing supply, and scandalous examples of failed liberalization attempts abroad were already dimming prospects of further reforms at home. The FEPC had the support of numerous groups, both within the business community and among consumers. These supporters were by no means resource poor, and their diversity seemed to assure that they would have legitimacy in the public eye, too. The LDP members were receptive, and the initiative to block the renewable energy bill began in earnest. Sometimes a political battle seems to tick all the right theoretical boxes for success, yet still fails to win. The fight to block the renewable energy bill was just such an issue. Electric power companies and their allies disliked most renewable energy sources because they were well known to be costly, unreliable, and lacking in density and scale, meaning that many new generating sites would have to be found. Opponents of the bill were well connected, gave campaign contributions to both the government and the opposition, had the vocal support of energy-intensive corporations wanting lower prices and higher security, and had key support of well-established politicians and other allies within the ministries. Their issue was consistent with the public’s wish for higher disposable income, and had minimal organized opposition in Japan. In contrast, proponents of renewable energy in Japan, which was part of a global “green” movement of advocacy journalists, activist scholars, and alternative energy firms, began in the late 1980s as a fledgling technology but attracted only limited and vague support. Nevertheless, on June 7, 2002, despite organized resistance from the electric power industry, the Act on Special Measures Concerning the Use of New Energy by Operators of Electric Utilities (Act No. 62) passed. Ten years later, another opportunity to sideline a renewable energy initiative arose, this time a bill forcing the electric power companies to purchase renewable energies at pre-determined rates known as the feed-in-tariff (FIT) for fixed periods of time in order to entice suppliers into the Japanese market. The costs to the utilities would then be passed along to ratepayers, thus raising what were already some of the highest electricity prices in the industrial world and further decreasing consumer welfare. Once again, the electric power companies and their allies in business and the ministries objected-this time, publicly and vociferously. Nevertheless, on August 30, 2011, despite organized resistance by a range of incumbent political actors, another renewable energy bill passed into law. Why? Much has been written about political resource endowments and their influence (or lack thereof) in political decision-making theory. In a sense, it is fairly well accepted that political resources manage to induce the support of economically depressed and fragmented local host communities for the siting, licensing, and construction of essential facilities such as hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, and high-transmission electric power towers (Lesbirel 1998; Aldrich 2008; also see Chapter 6). Unlike the execution of existing policies designed to induce top-down local compliance, however, the issue of who controls whom at the national policy-making level-the classic “who governs” debate surrounding all of Japanese political economy-is a much more complicated process. Previous scholarly attempts to identify exactly who governs the electric power and energy sectors-the politicians, the bureaucracy, or the private sector-have led some scholars to conclude that no one actor clearly dominates the others (c.f. Johnson 1978; Samuels 1987; Scalise 2009; Hymans 2011). The question therefore seems not to be who controls whom, since that varies over time, but how and perhaps when structural reform takes place. In this chapter, we discuss the history and drivers of change in Japanese post-war energy market restructuring on both an economic and political level. The analysis reveals that many of the untested assumptions regarding alleged profit-maximizing, goal-oriented economic behavior of well-organized actors utilizing political resources to capture beneficial policies (rent seeking) in the decision-making process fail to explain puzzling market transformations adequately. Japan’s electric power sector has been plagued by rising electricity prices, declining operating profits, and mounting institutional and systemic obstacles in turning the tide for decades. Rather than ignoring these counter-intuitive market developments, the chapter builds upon the work of Goldstein and Keohane (1993), Jones (2001), Woll (2008), and other scholars suggesting that objective or material self-interest is subordinate to ideational roadmaps-sometimes called “policy images”-guiding actor preferences, decisions, and perceptions of fairness. We begin by analyzing one of the most salient casualties of these conflicting policy images: consumer welfare. © 2014 selection and editorial material, Jeff Kingston.

N2  - Jewish Souls, Bureaucratic Minds examines the phenomenon of Jewish bureaucracy in the Russian empire-its institutions, personnel, and policies-from 1850 to 1917. In particular, it focuses on the institution of expert Jews, mid-level Jewish bureaucrats who served the Russian state both in the Pale of Settlement and in the central offices of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in St. Petersburg. The main contribution of expert Jews was in the sphere of policymaking and implementation. Unlike the traditional intercession of shtadlanim (Jewish lobbyists) in the high courts of power, expert Jews employed highly routinized bureaucratic procedures, including daily communications with both provincial and central bureaucracies. Vassili Schedrin illustrates how, at the local level, expert Jews advised the state, negotiated power, influenced decisionmaking, and shaped Russian state policy toward the Jews. Schedrin sheds light on the complex interactions between the Russian state, modern Jewish elites, and Jewish communities. Based on extensive new archival data from the former Soviet archives, this book opens a window into the secluded world of Russian bureaucracy where Jews shared policymaking and administrative tasks with their Russian colleagues. The new sources show these Russian Jewish bureaucrats to be full and competent participants in official Russian politics. This book builds upon the work of the original Russian Jewish historians and recent historiographical developments, and seeks to expose and analyze the broader motivations behind official Jewish policy, which were based on the political vision and policymaking contributions of Russian Jewish bureaucrats. Scholars and advanced students of Russian and Jewish history will find Jewish Souls, Bureaucratic Minds to be an important tool in their research. © 2016 by Wayne State University Press, Detroit, Michigan 48201.

N2  - Throughout the long nineteenth century, the Habsburg Monarchy was characterized by a steady discussion on nation building, national identities, and the national characterization of already existing or newly founded public and private institutions. Almost every political issue brought up in public was immediately after transformed into one of national concern. Today’s Roman Catholic Croatian Priest College in Rome whose beneficiaries stemmed entirely from among Habsburg citizens was no exception. When in 1901 this formerly Illyrian institution was to be transformed into an ethnic Croatian, this met not only with Austrian and Hungarian state interest and critic, but was also commented in the press Monarchy-wide even when the reformation plans were not exactly known. Unlike some other scholarly works, this chapter highlights the perspective of Habsburg state bureaucrats who challenged the papal reformation plans, as they feared that the new college would support Croatian nationalism within an institution which was under the patronage of Franz Joseph, and financially supported by Austrian ministries. Finally, this chapter shows how carefully state institutions had to manoeuvre through an issue which for a while seemed to affect the Habsburg relationship with the Holy See. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - As Multilateral Development Banks increasingly gained influence in shaping global development, transnational social movements pushed to hold them accountable for their human rights impact towards communities. Leon Valentin Schettler presents a novel causal mechanism of movement advocacy towards MDBs, combining disruptive and conventional tactics. Systematically comparing the evolution of human rights standards and complaint mechanisms over the last three decades, he reveals how the combination of 1) declining US hegemony, 2) counter-mobilization by China and 3) movement cooptation by the World Bank bureaucracy led to a dilution of human rights accountability in the 2010s. © 2020 transcript Verlag, Bielefeld.

N2  - America's current national political system got much of its shape from transformations engendered between 1960 and 1980. Owing to the rise in education levels among all Americans and the need for professional legislators, bureaucrats, legislative and professional staff, judges, and lobbyists, America witnessed the rise of "professional government" to carry out ever-growing governmental responsibilities. These governing professionals are an elite built on merit through occupational accomplishment, and many of them seek to rule regardless of voter participation. This has furthered the sense of disconnect among the public and created a self-reinforcing chain. Popular discontent and professional government are central and related features of the contemporary American political system. © 2012 De Gruyter.

N2  - An important part of the constitutional design of the federal government is the separation of powers. A key aspect of that design is the Appointments Clause, which governs how officers of the United States are installed in their positions. The clause presumptively requires that all such officers must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. But it authorizes Congress to bypass that procedure and vest the appointment of ``inferior Officers{''} exclusively in the President, the Courts of Law, or the Heads of Department. How to distinguish between inferior and non-inferior officers, and thus how to determine who among federal officialdom must be appointed by the President with the Senate's approval, is a task that has bedeviled the Supreme Court for decades. In its 1997 decision, Edmond v. United States, the Court held that the distinction turns on the degree to which an officer is ``directed and supervised{''} by other, non-inferior officers. The Court articulated three factors to guide that assessment, including whether the officer is protected from removal and whether the officer has the power unilaterally to make a final decision. In its ruling this past Term in United States v. Arthrex, Inc., the high court signaled a departure from Edmond and embarked on a different analytical path. Effectively eschewing the Edmond direction-and-supervision standard along with its multi-factor analysis, the Court appears to have adopted a straightforward ``significance{''} standard, such that an officer is non-inferior if the officer wields significant power. The Court's shift in Arthrex is, however, more implicit than explicit, given the precedential constraints of Edmond and other cases that have employed ``significance{''} as the standard to distinguish officers from non officers, rather than inferior from non-inferior officers. Consequently, the Court's analysis in Arthrex is set forth using the terms of Edmond. But Arthrex's essentially exclusive reliance on the Edmond ``final decision{''} factor coupled with its emphasis on the importance of maintaining accountability for official action that, like the patent dispute at issue in Arthrex, can have tremendous impact on the property rights and other liberties of private parties suggests that the Court's allegiance to Edmond is superficial and strategic. If, then, the Court is moving towards a plain significance standard and our review of the Court's ruling concludes that it is then this shift should be applauded. It makes the Court's Appointments Clause case law better cohere with that clause's original meaning, which does not use significance to distinguish officers from non-officers, but likely does so to distinguish inferior from non-inferior officers. It also better furthers the policy of democratic accountability, a policy that the Court's recent cases concerning the Appointments Clause including Arthrex as well as those concerning the coordinate issue of the President's power to remove officers, have stressed, and which animates the Constitution's rules and checks governing the selection and control of the Executive officer corps.

Relying on a principal-agent framework developed by Stephenson and Jackson, Kersh and Lowery and Marchetti, we first discuss the nature of agency problems in lobbying and the utility of several potential solutions for those problems. We next develop and test two sets of hypotheses on how agency problems might influence one form of lobbying behavior - the prices contract lobby firms charge their interest organization principals. The hypotheses are tested with a purposive sample of clients employing major contract lobby firms operating in Washington DC in 2012.

N2  - With reference to anthropological approaches to state borders as processes, this paper examines ‘the border’ between Pakistan and Azad Kashmir through the window of reconstruction politics after the 2005 earthquake in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Azad Kashmir. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, I analyse how ‘the border’ became inscribed into politics and power relations in Muzaffarabad through a locally contested ‘reconstruction bureaucracy’ which provided Pakistan with the means to dominate reconstruction in Azad Kashmir. Activists from Muzaffarabad politicised the delay of reconstruction by addressing Pakistan's interference in Azad Kashmir's affairs. Local politicisation of reconstruction, however, revealed contradictory effects of ‘the border’ on power relations in Muzaffarabad. From the activists’ perspectives, political boundaries between Pakistan and Azad Kashmir were characterised by domination as well as cooperation that undermined local concerns such as the reconstruction of Muzaffarabad. Thus, local activists also opposed ‘their’ government and transgressed ‘the border’ into Pakistan through the creation of alliances with national actors in order to put pressure on the government of Azad Kashmir. In taking advantage of power disparities between Pakistan and Azad Kashmir, these alliances, however, not only reproduced but also undermined the nation state's domination over the region by manipulating and circumventing the ‘reconstruction bureaucracy’.

N2  - Background Evidence-based decision-making is crucial to leadership in the health sector to identify country-level priorities and generate solutions supported by rigorous research. Barriers and enablers have been explored, but limited evidence about what works to strengthening capacity at individual and institutional levels within countries has been reported, and inconsistent use of evidence to inform policy-making is a persistent challenge and concern. Methods We conducted a framework analysis comparing experiences of nine purposively selected countries (Chile, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa and Sri Lanka). We utilised qualitative case studies developed by in-country teams to explore enablers and barriers described across components of a predefined theory of change and then identified six cross-cutting themes and recommendations for relevant stakeholders associated with each theme. Results The cross-cutting themes included (1) leadership and political will, (2) incentives and resources, (3) infrastructure and access to health data, (4) designated structures and processes, (5) interaction and relationships, and (6) capacity strengthening and engagement. While each case country's context and experience was different, common enablers and barriers surfaced across each of these themes, with Ministries of Health and other government agencies having strong roles to play, but also recognising the need for other stakeholders, including researchers, donors and civil society, to serve as essential collaborators in order to strengthen evidence uptake. Substantial and sustained investment in research capacities, able leaders and stronger engagement of civil servants are needed to further this progress and strengthen processes of health decision-making. Conclusions All countries represented in this study have made commendable progress in increasing evidence uptake and strengthening supportive systems. Establishing and strengthening necessary structures and the relationships that underpin them takes time as well as resources. Going forward, the findings from this study can help guide and support advocacy to increase domestic funding for health research, especially health policy and systems research, and ensure that civil servants as well as researchers have the capacity and support to collaborate and continue to bolster evidence uptake.

N2  - Interest groups - for example, business and professional associations, labor unions, and environmental and consumer groups - are a feature of every functioning democracy. All interest groups perform certain functions: providing information to public officials; seeking to persuade policy makers to pursue a preferred course of action, an activity that may be difficult to distinguish in practice from the attempt to inform; and communicating with and educating members. Within the context of these widely shared functions, organized interests vary substantially both within and across democracies with respect to the difficulty they face in gaining access, the techniques they use to influence policy, and the targets of their activities. In addition, political systems differ in terms of the structure of relations between interest groups and government: some political scientists have suggested that there are two basic patterns of organized interest interaction with the state, neocorporatist and pluralist. In terms of the kind of citizen interests represented by groups, although there are both substantial differences across democracies, the interests of producers are inevitably well represented. Two recent developments affect interest-group politics on a cross-national basis: the emergence of interest representation at the European Union and the emergence of greater pluralism in democracies everywhere.

N2  - Public sector industrial relations in Germany consist of two parts. On the one hand, wages and working conditions for civil servants are unilaterally determined by law, and on the other, there is a completely developed industrial relations system for non-civil servants (employees) working in the sector. Remarkably, although they have no right to take industrial action, civil servants are not in a worse situation than employees. In view of a simple concept of industrial relations where employers and workers are in complementary labour market roles, this seems difficult to explain. Indeed, public sector industrial relations are more complex. The article suggests that bargaining in the public sector is less an economic procedure than a dispute over the political, societal and statutory recognition of public services and an adequate participation of employees. Being aware of this special character of public sector industrial relations, the United Services Trade Union (Ver.di) tries to back strikes by organising societal support, whereas the German Federation of Civil Servants (DBB) operates more by lobbying in the political sphere and by recourse to the constitution. In spite of a general decline in collective bargaining and trade union density, and long years of austerity, both types of industrial relations are relatively stable.

N2  - Sam Houston, on the Texas Democratic state chairman who began the practice of having the Party endorse judicial candidates: "[O]ne drop of his blood would freeze a frog." "I've never seen the judiciary, national and state, so vulnerable," a leader of the judiciary in one of our largest states wrote to me recently. Vulnerability is obvious for judges facing elections, but problems are increasing in states with all types of selection systems. Dissatisfaction with courts is leading to a variety of challenges, from attempts to unseat judges because of unpopular decisions to efforts to shorten terms or politicize judicial selection. This Essay focuses on judicial selection and particularly judicial elections, which are found in thirty-nine states and faced by 89% of our state judges. Since 2000, judicial elections have drawn unprecedented attention because of (I) noisier, nastier, and costlier campaigns; (2) more involvement of interest groups; and (3) starting with 2002's Supreme Court decision in White v. Republican Party of Minnesota, the courts' invalidation of limits on judicial candidates' campaign conduct. Those court decisions, which so far have had almost no impact on campaigns, came after the other changes were established and spreading. This Essay presents the changes and the new scene that opened in 2004; the context and history of state judicial selection methods and elections; the court decisions and their impact; and finally, the five steps that are being taken to meet the new challenges: lengthening terms, increasing outreach by judges and the Bar (such as recent action in Missouri led by corporate general counsels), official "Voter Guides," campaign conduct committees, and new attention to recusal practices.

N2  - Even those who were the most uninformed and uninterested in the “politics of welfare�?, became interested and many became involved in the politics which surrounded the passage of the Social Security Amendments of 1967. In terms of national associations and federal agencies the politics of welfare may be viewed on the basis of the relationships between the few who control federal agencies and the few who occupy the leadership roles in national voluntary associations. This chapter focuses on the national voluntary association and its relationship to federal agencies with regard to eight specific aspects. They are, national voluntary association as promoter and reformer; national associations as partners of federal bureaucracy; national voluntary associations in the legislative arena; national voluntary associations in the administrative and fund allocation process; national associations as the antagonists of federal agencies; national associations as supporters of federal agencies; national associations as initiators of social policy or programs; and national associations as representatives of special interest groups.

N2  - ``Transparency{''} has become a widely recognized, even taken for granted, value in contemporary democracies, but this has been true only since the 1970s. For all of the obvious virtues of transparency for democracy, they have not always been recognized or they have been recognized, as in the U.S. Freedom of Information Act of 1966, with significant qualifications. This essay catalogs important shortcomings of transparency for democracy, as when it clashes with national security, personal privacy, and the importance of maintaining the capacity of government officials to talk frankly with one another without fear that half-formulated ideas, thoughts, and proposals will become public. And when government information becomes public, that does not make it equally available to all-publicity is not in itself democratic, as public information (as in open legislative committee hearings) is more readily accessed by empowered groups with lobbyists able to attend and monitor the provision of the information. Transparency is an element in democratic government, but it is by no means a perfect emblem of democracy.

N2  - We examine the characteristics of business firms that gain access to legislative and executive branch officials in the trade policymaking area. Our empirical analysis of over 1200 manufacturers reveals that legislators were most attracted to firms with foreign market expertise, firms which actively participated in politics with outside lobbyists and campaign contributions, and firms with significant employment in the state and/or district. Executive branch officials were responsive to firms with foreign market expertise, firms from industries that had previously received tariff protection, firms using in-house government affairs specialists and outside lobbyists to convey information, and firms making campaign contributions to members of the trade oversight legislative committees. Our results largely support the political market framework and provide insights about the attractiveness of certain demanders to suppliers of trade policies from the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. federal government. © 2011 Berkeley Electronic Press.

N2  - Why would incumbents undertake institutional reforms that constrain their discretion over state resources? Many studies point to electoral competition in response. They argue that incumbents who risk exit from office undertake reform to insure themselves against potentially hostile successors. This paper challenges this line of reasoning, arguing that it confounds two potential implications of electoral competition – potential and certain electoral losses – which yield contrary reform incentives. Certain exits from office may well incentivize reforms as insurance. Where elections are contested, however, incumbents face incentives to resist reforms that constrain discretion over state resources that provide incumbents with electoral advantage. This argument is developed and assessed with an institutional reform the literature has so far neglected: job stability protections (tenure) in politicized bureaucracies. A case analysis of the Dominican Republic and suggestive cross-country data confirm theoretical predictions: electoral uncertainty dis-incentivizes tenure reform. Electoral competition may thus be a double-edged sword for institutional reform.

N2  - Democratisation has brought checks and balances, and new state agencies, to Indonesian politics. Checks and balances and greater responsiveness to the public have also been sought in the appointment processes for the senior management of these new bodies. This paper examines the merits of the new appointment processes, in particular sequential selection, through a case study of the leadership selection process for the Corruption Eradication Commission. It reviews the process stipulated by law and its implementation in 2003, 2007 and 2010. The study argues that, while the short-listing of candidates by the selection committee aims at unprecedented openness and meritocracy, the process used has been tedious and has given insufficient weight to candidates' track records. Despite criticism that the final selection was pre-determined, the paper concludes that the overall selection process has upheld the principle of checks and balances between the executive and the legislature and ensured diversity of political support.

N2  - As President Xi Jinping expands and deepens his mark on the Chinese political system, how should scholars assess the impact of his administration on core institutions such as the police? This article employs a mixed methods approach by combining data from interview research with text analysis of ministerial level documents to explore reforms and rhetoric in the public security bureaucracy during the first six years of Xi's tenure. The timing, nature, and practical execution of police reform shed light on the priorities of the Xi administration and its ability to make changes to the police bureaucracy and enforce law and order in Chinese cities. The paper assesses key policing reform rhetoric using Jean-Paul Brodeur's framework of high and low policing to analyze which areas of policing have received the most attention and in what ways. Ultimately, I find that preferences for ``high policing{''} style stability maintenance reforms supersede concern for ``low policing{''} activities such as crime-fighting, resulting in the further politicization of policing in China.

N2  - Article II of the Constitution grants the president power to appoint ``Ambassadors{''} and ``other public Ministers{''} with the advice and consent of the Senate. By all accounts, this language requires Senate confirmation for the appointment of resident ambassadors and other diplomats of similar rank and tenure. Yet these are hardly the only agents of U.S. foreign relations. Ad hoc diplomats-individuals chosen exclusively by the president to complete limited and temporary assignments-play a comparably significant role in addressing international crises, negotiating treaties, and otherwise executing foreign policy. This Article critically examines the appointments process for such irregular agents. An orthodox view holds it permissible for the president to dispatch any ad hoc diplomat without Senate confirmation, but this view does not accord with the original meaning of Article II. Scrutinizing text and an extensive collection of original historical sources, I show that, under a formalist reading of the Constitution, the appointment of most ad hoc diplomats requires the advice and consent of the Senate because these agents are typically ``public Ministers{''} and ``Officers of the United States{''} under the Appointments Clause. The analysis makes several contributions. First, it provides the first thorough account of the original meaning of ``public Ministers{''}-a term that appears several times in the Constitution but lacks precise contours in contemporary scholarship and practice. Second, for formalists, the analysis reorients longstanding debates about the process of treaty-making and empowers the Senate to exert greater influence over a wide variety of presidential initiatives, including communications with North Korea, the renegotiation of trade agreements, the campaign to defeat ISIS, and the stabilization of Ukraine, all of which have relied on the work of ad hoc diplomats. At a time of trepidation over the nature of U.S. foreign policy, such influence might operate as a stabilizing force. Third, the analysis illuminates rhetorical and doctrinal maneuvers that have facilitated the rise of the modern presidency, including historical revisionism and the marginalization of international law as an input in constitutional interpretation. These maneuvers complicate the political valence of originalism and cast the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)-a key proponent of the orthodox view-as a motivated expositor of the separation of powers.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to evaluate and analyse the politicization of the government administration in the South African context. This article challenges the view held by many scholars and practitioners of public administration and the public at large that there are available options dividing the politics and the administration of government, and that such is achievable in South Africa. In Africa and worldwide the citizens complain and associate the benefits of a government administration to be exclusive to a certain sector of individuals and their groups with sound political connections and inter-relationships. While today most government administrations claim to operate through systems that are fair, equitable and transparent, such claim remains relative because fairness, equity and transparency may only be a privilege to those within the circle of political friendship and ties in government. In essence, the general view held on the relationship between politics and government administration is that, there are alternative approachesto provide government administration that is neutral and objective to the politics ofthe country. The research question to be answered in this article is whether the South African government may have sound alternative approaches towards separating their government administration from their subjective party political agenda. This article argues, however, that South Africa's claim of fair, equitable and objectively practised public administration free from political persecution of the opposition is a myth which started with the Mandela's reconciliatory public administration through the Mbeki's depoliticized bureaucracy and the current politicized bureaucracy of the Zuma administration. A fair public administration free from political interferences and interventions is likely not to exist even in the most highly respected democratic states of the globe.

N2  - Just like national administration, international organizations are subject to politicization and its ambivalent effects. The present article makes use of relevant contributions to the theory of formal organizations and bureaucracy in an attempt to conceptualize the politicization phenomenon. A case of norm emergence and norm implementation within the system of the United Nations is analyzed, the principle of a Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and the phases of its constructive and obstructive politicization. The argument is that the impact of politicization increases when internal and external politicization impulses coincide and that strategic communication of policy entrepreneurs may decisively influence the constructive or obstructive character of politicization.

N2  - Before leaving his post in 2018, the outgoing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, made a series of critical remarks, both publicly and internally, regarding what he considered weakening of the integrity and effectiveness of the UN in its human rights mandate. Zeid's comments highlighted retrogressive tendencies making the task of a strong and independent High Commissioner exceedingly difficult. The post of High Commissioner, established in 1994 following decades of advocacy, to give a high level voice to human rights promotion and protection as well as to manage a secretariat for most UN human rights functions, has enjoyed mostly robust and effective leadership by its post-holders. Any High Commissioner faces challenge inherent to the job in balancing the functions of diplomat, human rights advocate for "the voiceless", and agency manager working with an insufficient and patently unfair budgetary allotment. The new High Commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, will have her work cut out, as she faces an apparent retreat from prioritizing human rights, particularly by some States that previously championed them; ambivalence by a wider UN bureaucracy; and a wave of authoritarian populist leaders and movements around the globes that take a hostile view to the human rights paradigm. The new High Commissioner would do well to keep her energies squarely focused on independently tackling urgent substantive and possibly existential human rights challenges, rather than any project of administrative restructuring of the OHCHR, even as she may pursue a working methodology that is distinct from the approach of her predecessors.

N2  - In the present study we examine how Finnish vocational education and training (VET) experts reflect on multiculturalism in the aftermath of a major reform. The research material consists of interviews with educational policy experts in Finnish VET, namely: principals, government officials and lobbyists (N = 11). A qualitative thematic analysis reveals the following three latent themes through which experts reflect on multiculturalism: 1) multiculturalism as individualisation; 2) multiculturalism as competition; and 3) multiculturalism as shared responsibility. The results show that Finnish VET experts see multiculturalism as a critical challenge for education and working life. On the other hand, it is still unclear whether the 2018 VET reform will be able to resolve the different dilemmas and contradictions that the experts connect with multiculturalism. Experts understand multiculturalism narrowly as synonymous with immigration and as something that happens in encounters with Finns, even though it is not shared by Finns themselves. While most of the experts argue that personalisation and working life are particularly important for immigrants and students with an immigrant background, others are worried about the future of broader social competences in Finnish VET.

N2  - The article brings up to date the issue of corruption in the system of public management in European states. A set of measures to improve anti-corruption activities at the current stage of development of the world community is provided on the basis of the efficiency analysis regarding the current corruption preventive policy. The issue of corruption is among the global challenges of the day, addressing which will affect the way of development of the world community in the new century. One can see socially destructive consequences of corruption in all aspects of public life. Today, the issues of corruption are of special concern in respect of public authorities. The issue of corruption with multiple forms, such as lobbying, bribery, veiled thefts and abuses, is a social disease that is being globally integrated into the world community. However, the issue is of equal concern for developed countries as well as for the countries with the lower levels of economic development. ``Transparency International{''} International non-governmental organization publishes annual ratings of countries regarding the level of perception of corruption. In 2016, for example, the average figure for 176 countries of the world was 43 points out of 100. In 2016, Denmark and New Zealand recorded the lowest level of corruption. These countries scored 90 points. Finland, Sweden and Switzerland were also found in the first five. The highest level of corruption was recorded in Somalia, South Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Yemen, - these countries scored less than 20 points. The rating illustrates interdependence between corruption and inequality in the distribution of power and national income in society. Corruption is a system of social relations that destruct society. However, there is no consensus on the reasons for corruption. To some extent, it is related to the intersectoral nature of the phenomenon, which is being studied by scientists from different branches of science at the same time (lawyers, managers, economists, sociologists, political scientists, etc.). The ``multidimensional picture{''} of the causes of corruption, received as the result of the analysis will provide an opportunity to significantly modernize the anti-corruption policy. The analysis of public management, using the ``principal-agency relationships{''} model shows explicitly that the main reason for the phenomenon of corruption in public administration is a conflict of interests between the managed society and its public officers. This conflict of interests can be balanced through moral education of public servants, nurturing moral principles and values of the professional culture of officials in the new trends of public administration development. The problem of an integrated approach to the analysis of this social phenomenon appears to be the only option for a truly effective policy for preventing corruption at all levels of public service.

N2  - The Turkish government first announced its intention to proceed with tobacco plain packaging legislation in 2011; however, it was 7 years before the legislation passed in December 2018. This study (conducted in 2018 before the legislation was passed) explored the policy context in Turkey between the first announcement that plain packaging legislation would be introduced and the passage of the legislation in 2018, and identified barriers and facilitators influencing its introduction. Publicly available documents relevant to plain packaging in Turkey were analysed. Interviews were conducted in 2018 with ten key informants including academics, bureaucrats in government ministries and leaders of non-government organizations (NGOs). Thematic analysis was undertaken, using a framework for systematically analysing how issues reach the policy agenda. The introduction of plain packaging legislation proved to be problematic, with many false starts and delays. Findings suggest these were mainly due to political barriers including changes in government, tobacco industry opposition and the national economic crisis. However, plain packaging legislation in Turkey managed to advance on the policy agenda, primarily through the collaborative advocacy efforts of NGOs, academics, and leadership from particular tobacco control advocates and politicians. Turkey's experience provides lessons for the wider uptake of tobacco plain packaging legislation, illustrating the critical importance of building effective coalitions between a range of stakeholders and political support within government while raising public awareness. Lay summary This research provides insights into the barriers and facilitators of decision making and action that shaped the process of introducing tobacco plain packaging legislation in Turkey. Major barriers that slowed Turkey's progress in enacting plain packaging included the financial and national economic crisis in 2018, changes in health ministers and opposition by the tobacco industry. A major facilitator of the policy process was the collaborative advocacy efforts of non-government organizations, academics, politicians and the leadership of certain tobacco control advocates. The insights from this case study may help other low- and middle-income countries to anticipate and successfully navigate the challenges involved in introducing tobacco plain packaging, an important policy measure for reducing the burden of tobacco-related disease in their populations, and its social and economic impacts. Building effective coalitions and fostering and supporting leadership are important strategies for the successful introduction of plain packaging legislation. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - This article analyses media representations of LGBT social movements, taking the case of Saint Petersburg LGBT pride parades. The analysis is developed through the use of framing theory, which views the media as an arena where interest groups promote their own interpretations of particular issues. Frames juxtapose elements of the text in such a way as to provide the audience with a scheme within which to perceive the message. Social movements are viewed as interest groups that introduce new frames in public debate. Two types of frames can be distinguished: collective action frames and status quo frames. In this study, the usage of two collective action frames (equality frame and victim frame), and two status quo frames (morality frame and propaganda promoting homosexuality frame) were examined. Additionally, the sources of quotes used in news stories were analyzed. The study focuses on articles dedicated to Saint Petersburg LGBT pride marches in the years 2010–2017 in the most popular local Internet websites. The analysis shows that the coverage of LGBT pride marches can be divided into two distinct periods: 2010–2013 and 2014–2017. In the first period, LGBT activists dominated the coverage, quoted about twice as much as government officials. Equality and victim frames were prevalent. In the second period, activists were cited significantly less often, with the propaganda promoting homosexuality frame dominating the discourse. However, contrary to findings of previous studies on social movement representation, across the whole period under consideration, LGBT activists were quoted more often than government representatives. This finding calls for a further exploration of the conditions which allowed for such coverage in the context of political heterosexism and homophobia. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.

N2  - This paper looks at tariff boards from their creation in 1816 to their disappearance in 1845. By studying their regulation and composition, a new perspective is gained on how tariffs were elaborated and set, and the roles played by ideas and interest groups on the boards. The analysis of their members illustrates the complex transition from the Old Regime to early liberalism. Boards of tariffs, with a very stable memberships, were important factors in the continuity of tariff policy in the tariffs of 1820, 1825 and 1841.

N2  - This article examines the attitude adopted by Russian government
officials and diplomats toward the Iranian constitutional movement in
1907-1912. Framed by the discourse of international prestige, it was
shaped by fundamental factors such as foreign policy and domestic
security concerns, imperialism, and orientalism. Of no less importance
was the role of Russian diplomats in Iran. They had developed and
sustained a wide network of political clients who were supposed to act
as agents of Russian influence in the country, ranging from local
chieftains to members of the ruling dynasty. At some point, the
commitment of numerous Russian consular officers in Iran to their
clients outweighed pragmatism, and instead of building relationships
with the revolutionary government, they began lobbying for Russia's
military intervention in support of counterrevolutionary forces.
Depending on information coming from the field officers in Iran and
obsessed with the notion of imperial prestige and contempt for
revolution, the Russian government eventually gave in to this pressure.

N2  - From 2007 to 2012, Russian armed forces faced unprecedented changes that affected their structural, economic, social, and ideological elements. However, not all aims were fulfilled, and some changes were rolled back, despite the political and financial support from Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev for the defense minister Anatoly Serdyukov. Using the data from 11 interviews with former high-ranking military officers, scholars, and insider press workers, the research shows that the unsustainability of the reform was caused by the radicality of changes, the interest groups influence, and the technocratic policymaking in nondemocratic Russia. In addition, the research demonstrates the strategies the reformers used in order to overcome the resistance from mobilized interest groups. They had not succeeded, that ultimately led to the resignation of the defense minister, which stopped further radical changes in the contemporary Russian armed forces. © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - Asserting presidential preferences in a regulatory review bureaucracy US presidents face many challenges in executing their duties as CEOs of a mammoth sprawling bureaucracy known as the nation’s executive branch. Included among the many offices and bureaus in 2014 were 78 regulatory agencies with more than 276,000 employees who in recent years turned out annually some 80,000 Federal Register pages of rules and rule modifications. A successful president, e.g., one who can be reelected or help to pave the way for the party in the next election, must find ways to steer bureau activities in his preferred direction while delivering on regulatory promises made in the process of being elected. White House review of proposed regulations provides an opportunity for presidents to affect regulatory outcomes in ways that reward politically important interest groups. Our review of all empirical work on White House review as well as our own institutional and statistical findings yield strong support to the notion that the review process provides opportunities to make presidential preferences operational.

N2  - Different countries have different regulations for the approval and cultivation of crops developed by using new plant breeding technologies (NPBTs) such as gene editing. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between global food security and the level of NPBT regulation assuming a World Nation Official (WNO) proposes advice on global NPBT food policies. We show that a stricter NPBT food regulation reduces food security as measured by food availability, access, and utilization. We also find that political rivalry among interest groups worsens the food security status, given the NPBT food technology is more productive and the regulatory policy is influenced by lobbying. When the WNO aims to improve food security and weighs the NPBT food lobby contribution more than the non-NPBT food lobby's in the lobbying game, the total lobbying contributions will be the same for the WNO, and the NPBT food lobby will be more successful in the political process. The NPBT food lobby, however, under food security loses its advantage in the political competition, and this may result in a strict NPBT food policy. Under food security problems implementing stricter NPBT food regulations results in welfare losses.

N2  - The desirability of complete judicial independence has been debated in several recent works. At issue is whether democratic theory is compatible with policy making by the unelected U.S. Supreme Court justices, particularly as their service becomes further removed from the time when elected officials played a role in their appointment. We examine the relationship between appointing presidents and Supreme Court justices. Relying on ideal points that place all actors in the same scale, our regression models show that a justice will drift from the ideology of an appointing president with each additional term served, even after controlling for ideological shifts in political climate. The beginning of the eleventh term is when ideological drift becomes significant. The connection between justices and democratically elected officials begins to wane after this point in a justice's tenure-a finding that is likely to be germane for proponents of term limits for Supreme Court justices. © The Policy Studies Organization.

N2  - The rulers of Venice prided themselves on their unique brand of justice, which was a source of both ridicule and admiration for foreign commentators. This book uncovers what this special justice meant for ordinary subjects by studying the history of one of the oldest magistracies of the city, a body responsible for handling petty market crime and small-claims litigation. It examines how changing ideas about justice at the level of the political elite were related to judicial and policing practices in the courtroom and on the street. The book shows how failure to invest in the state bureaucracy allowed corruption to flourish and effectively delegated power to private interest groups such as the guilds. At the same time, it reveals that the bottom level of civil justice was fast, cheap, and accessible. Everyone had the chance to be heard, and the poor and disadvantaged could hope for justice along with the rich and powerful.

N2  - One of the strands in the growing scholarship on political advisers in parliamentary democracies proposes that advisers can reduce the risk of civil service politicization by furnishing partisan advice to ministers, freeing civil servants to focus on the provision of expert competence. This benign narrative generates a significant hypothesis, which is that the institutionalization of the partisan role diminishes the risk of civil service politicization. That hypothesis has yet to be fully tested. Several studies have assessed the impact of advisers' actions on civil service impartiality, but the consequences of bureaucrats' own agency for that dependent variable have received far less attention. Drawing on data from a survey of New Zealand public servants, this article challenges the assumption in the political advisers literature that civil service politicization is primarily driven by exogenous factors and calls for a more nuanced theoretical approach to endogenous aspects of politicization. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Recent research on political advisers is characterized by an expansion
beyond Westminster and clearer connections with proximate literatures.
This article speaks to the second of these features by applying the
Public Service Bargain (PSB) lens to minister/political adviser
relationships in new ways. Extant PSB analyses either position political
advisers as an independent variable influencing the core bargain between
ministers and senior officials, or face difficulties when viewing
advisers through existing perspectives developed to explain deals
between politicians and public servants. Consequently, the nature of
`the bargain applying to political advisers' (Hood and Lodge 2006, p.
128) remains unclear. This article addresses that lacuna by deploying
the reward, competence and loyalty dimensions of PSBs to specify the
broad terms of the political adviser bargain, and considers the
theoretical and empirical implications of such compacts.

N2  - This paper investigates the rise of a policy community in China's renewable energy sectors. After a decade of spectacular expansion of wind and solar energy industries, a PC that comprises both government and industrial actors is taking shape in China. The main finding of this research is that influential corporations, such as leading wind turbine and solar panel manufacturers or state-owned electricity utility companies, have played an important role in the renewable energy policy process by framing the strategic preferences and policy priority, and by negotiating and coordinating with state actors at both central and local level. Therefore, in China's climate governance domain, instead of a traditional perception of a state-led governance mode in which state officers are often believed to be the only crucial actors to steer climate-related policies, this study reveals that the government's autonomy in the policy process is increasingly constrained by the rising industrial interest groups who possess considerable resources and institutional power in China's renewable energy policy subsystem.

N1  - bureaucrats and interest groups lobbying together?
N2  - This paper examines the origins of the institutional organization and advocacy strategies that later culminated in American public broadcasting. Previous to the Communications Act of 1934, which privatized American broadcasting, educational radio lacked standards for best practices and functioned in a decentralized and localized form. After the Act, the Office of Education (OOE) took interest in radio as a medium to expand federal initiatives related to educational ``public forums,'' town-hall style meetings centered around community debate. Noting the lack of noncommercial channels in which to broadcast forums to a larger audience, the OOE began to collaborate with the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) to lobby the FCC, while producing civic programming with commercial broadcasters. Instead of fighting the regulation, the OOE and NAEB founded an advocacy approach centered on creating an alternate broadcasting infrastructure as a way to address regulatory precedents. In this process, early forms of production, distribution, and infrastructure later associated with public broadcasting were devised out of a hybrid of commercial broadcasting aesthetics and federal educational bureaucracy. Contrary to the received view, discussion of the origins of American public broadcasting must be framed as advocacy to change the national system through strategies of research, collaboration, and governmental incorporation instead of resistance.

N2  - Energy tax policy involves the use of one of the government's main fiscal instruments, taxes (both as an incentive and as a disincentive) to alter the allocation or configuration of energy resources and their use. In theory, energy taxes and subsidies, like tax policy instruments in general, are intended either to correct a problem or distortion in the energy markets or to achieve some economic (efficiency, equity, or even macroeconomic) objective. In practice, however, energy tax policy in the United States is made in a political setting, being determined by the views and interests of the key players in this setting: politicians, special interest groups, bureaucrats, academic scholars, and fiscal dictates. As a result, enacted tax policy embodies compromises between economic and political goals, which could either mitigate or compound existing distortions. The economic rationale for government intervention in energy markets is commonly based on the government's perceived ability to correct for market failures. Market failures, such as externalities, principal-agent problems, and informational asymmetries, result in an economically inefficient allocation of resources-in which society does not maximize well-being. To correct for these market failures governments can utilize several policy options, including taxes and regulation, in an effort to achieve policy goals. Current energy policy reflects efforts to achieve both current and past policy objectives. Recent legislative efforts have primarily focused on renewable energy production and conservation to address environmental concerns. In contrast, past efforts attempted to reduce reliance on foreign energy sources through increased domestic production of fossil fuels. Recently enacted legislation focusing on encouraging renewable energy production and conservation reduces reliance on imported, foreign oil, while also addressing environmental concerns by reducing the use of fossil fuels. Favorable tax preferences given to domestic fossil fuel energy sources also promote domestic energy production, reducing the demand for imported oil. In the 111th Congress energy tax legislation continues to be focused on increasing incentives for renewable energy production and conservation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) expanded and extended a number of tax incentives designed to promote renewable energy, conservation, and alternative technology vehicles. In addition, the President's 2010 and 2011 Budget Proposals contain a number of provisions that would, if enacted, continue to move energy policy toward promoting alternative energy sources by eliminating a number of the tax subsidies currently available to the oil and gas industry while also imposing additional taxes that would be borne-at least partially-by these industries. The President's 2011 Budget Proposal continued this policy direction through the proposed removal of a number of subsidies currently available to the coal industry. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

N2  - The stagnation in banking sector reform is puzzling given the Chinese
leadership's seeming resolve to reform other sectors of the economy.
This article develops a political explanation of why reform oriented
central bureaucrats have centralized financial power without
liberalizing the banking sector. The starting point of this explanation
is that top bureaucrats value political survival as much as other
members of the Politburo. Thus, they make policies based on both
political and economic considerations. This framework is tested on three
cases related to China's non-performing loan (NPL) problem: the
politicization of the NPL problem, policies designed to slow the
creation of NPLs and policies aimed at decreasing the pool of NPLs. The
findings strongly suggest that political considerations play a large
role in shaping financial policies in China.

N2  - The demand for decentralized government has increased with widespread political devolution, because it is perceived as a more efficient and accountable form of government. However, the limited autonomy in subnational governments is criticized, for fiscal decentralization has the potential to increase corruption and to harm government accountability, because representatives and bureaucrats in local governments may be involved in private corporations and other special interest groups. Moreover, little attention has been paid to U.S. state and local governments. This study considers multiple perspectives in fiscal decentralization in the state governments, and examines the effects of fiscal decentralization on state corruption. The empirical findings contribute to the argument in the extant research that corruption in U.S. state governments increases in a more decentralized structure.

N2  - Taxing behavior deemed "politically incorrect" has long been a convenient way for politicians to fund programs benefiting special interest groups, to the public's disadvantage. Government policy toward various goods - drugs, tobacco and alcohol, for example - has been locked into a regulatory cycle of tax and taboo. Support for legalizing other substances is buttressed by the revenue-generating power of so-called "sin" taxesi And the products subjected to excise taxation have varied from soft drinks, fishing gear and margarine to airline tickets, telephone calls and gasoline. Taxing Choice thoroughly addresses the costs and benefits of these predatory public policies. Shughart notes that the record of such punitive selective taxation has been anything but successful, hindering economic progress and failing to deliver the promised social benefits. In addition, the costs of selective taxes fall disproportionately on lower-income people, while more politically powerful interest groups benefit. At the same time, such policies are a poor way to raise funding for public services, and foster political corruption and self-serving bureaucracies accountable to no one. Indeed, policies discriminating against certain products may represent ominous trends easily extended into virtually every facet of people's lives. One can envision policies proscribing foods, sun bathing, obesity, and even books, films, and political and religious beliefs deemed "dangerous."Part I is devoted to the political economy of selective taxation. Contributors trace the history and politics of selective excise taxes in the United States, discussing the range of products that have been subject to such taxation from the founding period to the present. Part II explains how these taxes emerge in a political marketplace with opposing pressure groups scrambling for wealth transfers in their own favor. Part III looks at taxes on specific products as well as such banning policies as Prohibition and the war on drugs. Constitutional, economic, and civil liberty issues, including civil asset forfeiture and product liability, are discussed in Part IV. With the accelerating national debate over tax reform and the downsizing of government, Taxing Choice is a timely and far-reaching contribution to a debate of great interest to economists, policymakers, historians, sociologists, and taxpayers in general.

N2  - Client-provider relationships have significant effects on how individuals comprehend their life situation during chronic disease and illness. Yet, little is known about how frontline health care providers (HCPs) influence client's identity formation through meaning-making with clients such as HIV-positive women living in poverty. This requires ethical consideration of the meanings made between clients and providers about client's health and wellbeing, both individually and in the larger society. Health care providers (N = 15) and married women living with HIV (N = 33) in north-central India engaged in separate intensive interviews providing narrative data which were analysed using a conceptual framework crossing Lipsky's street-level bureaucracy theory (Lipsky 2010) with meaning-making processes. HCPs and women construct meanings of women's role as caregivers that impact women's sense of identity, health, and well-being. Findings indicate that despite being well-intentioned, HCPs inadvertently reinforce rigid gender norms and convey that women's worth is tied to their familial caregiving role. HCPs' discretionary advocacy may also reinforce societal images of women as incapable and needy, thereby harming them more generally. Attention to the gender-sensitive training of HIV health care providers may assure that discretion is ethically interrogated to promote gender equity and enhance women's access to social welfare services.

N2  - Although much of the research on learning in the public sector examines collaborative arrangements and interorganizational networks, it often stresses the importance of individual dialogue and social interaction as primary methods of learning. Given the collective focus, the current emphasis on organizational interaction has left the individual mechanisms by which learning occurs unspecified and understudied. This study takes as its unit of analysis the dyadic, advice seeking ties that operate as the pathways by which knowledge is transferred and developed among organizational members. Rather than exploring a single advice or knowledge sharing network, this study offers a novel approach for examining the social dynamics of organizational learning by linking two different types of task-relevant knowledge to the social networks that emerge when employees search for that knowledge. By measuring where expertise resides in each knowledge specific network and by modeling the processes and conditions affecting knowledge transfer, this study is able to analyze how efficiently organizations tap into the resources and skills that already exist among their members. The findings suggest that employees tend to ignore the experts when seeking tacit information, and instead rely on those they feel most comfortable with and with whom are most accessible. Several important distinctions to the patterns of network formation are noted between public and private organizations. Overall, the results suggest that public managers need to pay attention to the costs of knowledge sharing as much as its benefits in order to promote organizational learning.

N2  - Introduction Civic engagement and community development programs provide a unique opportunity for underrepresented communities to participate in the governance process of their country. For this reason, researchers and practitioners have begun to explore the intersection between civic engagement and community development. Equally, there is also the question of the role of citizenship in demanding better governance through civic engagement and community development. This chapter focuses on how civic engagement shapes community development by focusing on the role of citizenship using The Gambia as a case study. Government officials, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) were surveyed on the level of civic engagement of citizens and whether these translated into meaningful community development activities and/or transformation in community policies. The political landscape of many African countries is changing and The Gambia is no exception to that. As a byproduct of a call for better governance in recent years from tyrants, dictators, and presidents for life, many African countries, including The Gambia, have witnessed an increase in citizens taking an active role in the political process. Although gains have been made in the development of stable political systems in many countries in Sub Saharan Africa, recent incidents in the Ivory Coast, Mali, and The Gambia, where respective presidents have historically rejected the results of elections and the will of the people, suggest that there are still democratic issues to be resolved. However, despite these situations, citizens are taking an active role in the political process to oust dictators by facing their fears. To strengthen and amalgamate the gains made by citizens in The Gambia, it is important that these gains be reinforced by CBOs and civil societies against misrule. While there are no disagreements on the existence of civil societies in Africa or in The Gambia by scholars, the study of civil society is however plagued with definitional muddiness. There seem to be disagreements on actors and groups that constitute civil society. For this chapter, we chose to use the definition provided by the London School of Economics (LSE): Civil society refers to the arena of uncoerced collective action around shared interests, purposes and values. In theory, its institutional forms are distinct from those of the state, family and market, though in practice, the boundaries between state, civil society, family and market are often complex, blurred and negotiated. Civil society commonly embraces a diversity of spaces, actors and institutional forms, varying in their degree of formality, autonomy and power. Civil societies are often populated by organizations such as registered charities, development nongovernmental organizations, community groups, youth and women’s organizations, faith-based organizations, professional associations, trade unions, self-help groups, social movements, business associations, coalitions, farmer associations and advocacy groups. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - This article examines how directors of community-based housing organisations (CBHOs) in the US define the role of citizen participation in their organisations. In particular, it describes how local political and administrative structures affect the scope of citizen participation in the governance and decision-making processes of CBHOs. This is an important topic since these organisations implement housing and community development programmes in urban neighbourhoods, and citizen participation has been considered important to the legitimacy of these efforts. The analysis is based on in-depth interviews with CBHO executive directors in Buffalo, New York. In particular, the executive directors of CBHOs that concentrate their efforts on the management, development and rehabilitation of affordable housing were interviewed. In addition to data from in-depth interviews, data from fieldnotes, the US census, IRS 990 forms and informal conversations with local government officials and representatives of intermediary organisations were used in the analysis. Existing theories concerning citizen participation and non-profit administration are elaborated upon and applied to CBHOs. The extent to which these organisations create opportunities for grassroots planning is considered and recommendations for expanding citizen participation are proposed.

N2  - In the last twenty years, anthropologists, archivists, and historians have dedicated increased attention to the study of archives as objects of research themselves. In so doing, scholars have predominantly examined the emergence and transformations of archives during the early modern age, focusing mostly on political and diplomatic depositories. They have tended to neglect financial archives, which is unfortunate, as—alongside judicial archives—they were probably the largest documentary repositories of the pre-modern world and those that first faced the problem of managing huge masses of documentation. This article discusses the formation and development of the Kingdom of Sicily’s financial archives in the later Middle Ages, arguing that this repository evolved into a collecting archive by the early fifteenth-century, when it preserved not only the records and accounts produced by the central financial administration, but also those from a number of territorial officers and magistracies. This archival turn, I suggest, originated from the fact that the Crown of Aragon’s rulers constantly needed increased incomes to fund bureaucracies and warfare and exercise patronage, and thus needed financial information organized, at hand, and under their control. After briefly discussing the emergence of the financial archive in the thirteenth-century, this essay traces the Crown’s attempts to create a stable repository for storing financial records and accounts and its continuous struggles to prevent documentation from being scattered and dispersed. Finally, it examines the successful strategy that King Alfonso V of Aragon (1416–58), called the Magnanimous, pursued to organize financial documentation and concentrate records and accounts produced by financial administration into a stable building. The essay pays particular attention to the material aspects of preserving records, e.g., the restoration of buildings, construction of chests, and preparation of secure locks that were integral to the emergence of collecting archives for financial documents in the later Middle Ages. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Despite a number of initiatives aimed at improving the representation and progression of women in the police service in England and Wales, the number of women in leadership ranks remains low. At the same time, concern over the quality of police leadership has been at the forefront of much public debate in recent years. This article focuses on recent proposals to reform the way in which senior officers are recruited through a discussion of the appointment of non-sworn/‘outsider’ officers through the adoption of direct and multiple entry models of recruitment as outlined by the Winsor Review (2012, Independent review of police officer and staff remuneration and conditions. Part 2. http://review.police.uk/part-two-report/). Hailed as an opportunity to secure an alternative face to police leadership, we reflect on the growing disquiet over police leaders and leadership and consider the possibilities of such a reform agenda for the representation and progression of women in policing. We propose that although a multipoint system of entry for specialisation or leadership roles may offer a number of opportunities to a service in crisis, such a reform agenda may ultimately serve to threaten and further undermine women's participation and status in policing as ‘outsiders’. © 2013 SAGE Publications.

N2  - This article provides rich and unique insights into the experiences of women police leaders across seven European regions. Drawing on interview data, it presents accounts of women's experiences in policing and identifies informal and formal barriers to their advancement in European police organizations. Women police leaders report high levels of gender discrimination, obstruction and prejudice over the course of their careers. We argue that there are a number of subjective and informal criteria of `acceptability' that shape women's experiences of promotion and that informal patronage is a strong basis from which strategic appointments are made within European police systems. The article makes sense of the ways in which informal aspects of career progression function alongside formal promotion criteria to preserve men as the `ideal' candidates for police leadership positions, resulting in a preference for other men and the exclusion of women. The relevance of these findings is key to informing the future selection and development of police leaders in an increasingly complex police landscape.

N2  - The monetary unification in Europe- the establishment of a single currency for all members of the European Union - has been conceptualized and promoted mainly in economic terms. The economics of monetary unification analyze the (mainly economic) costs and benefits that member states draw from replacing multiple national currencies with a single currency. The political factor has been habitually put aside as the benevolent despot view of the government was tacitly embraced with regard to the creation of the monetary union. Similarly, the process of euro adoption by countries that entered the European Union (EU) later is usually described as being driven by economic factors. The process of nominal and real convergence with older members has been carefully analyzed. Much less weight has been put on the complex interaction of economic and political dimensions during preparations for euro adoption, such as the political interests of national governments and their relation with major internal economic players. The multifaceted interplay of economic and political factors suggests the opportunity to take a political economy perspective on this complex issue. In this sense, a number of key political-economy related issues can be distilled in relation to the process of euro adoption, which will structure the following analysis. What are the key national winners and losers of this possible event? What role has interest-groups pressure played in this process? Under what circumstances may bureaucracies such as the central bank body of experts act as a deterrent for the political end that is the common currency adoption? How are internationally exposed companies expected to behave and to promote their interests in relation to this event? What is the relative importance of the internal politics dynamic for euro adoption? We rely on process tracing to approach these questions for the Romanian case. Policy documents, newspaper articles, academic articles, economic indicators and elite interviews are used to create an analytical narrative based both on a one-point-in-time description of the situation and on a timeline that lists the sequence of some relevant events. We argue that a specific combination of economic and political factors leads to the failed euro adoption in Romania.

N2  - This article analyses interest groups in the agricultural sector in Lithuania, and compares them with the rest of the population of interest groups across other sectors at the national level. The analysis is based on data from the International Comparative Interest Group Survey (CIGS). A survey of organizations representing various interests was carried out from September to November 2016, and covered all Lithuanian interest organizations operating at the national level. The survey was designed to clarify the development of these organizations, their daily activities, and their applied strategies, as well as identifying the challenges they face. In accordance with this study, the aim of this article is to identify the profile and specificity of interest groups in the field of agricultural policy. The data showed that the share of agricultural interest groups is one of the largest amongst the rest of the population of Lithuanian national interest groups, but the number of members of this sector's interest groups is lower than average. In the agricultural sector, interest groups are distinguished by the fact that they are clearly dominated by sectoral associations - one of the types of business groups. The Lithuanian agricultural interest organizations that were analysed apply both direct and indirect pressure strategies equally, but they are more likely than other organizations to contact the representatives of the state bureaucratic apparatus. These are predominantly bureaucrats working in ministries and ministers themselves, although it has to be mentioned that members of the Seimas were also frequently in contact with the Lithuanian agricultural interest organizations under study.

N2  - The stakeholder approach has been, since the decade of 1980, one of the most relevant theories to understand the relationship that is established between the different groups that intertwine in everyday's managerial practices of an organization. Such theory is relevant to comprehend school's managerial process, since schools are constituted by stakeholders who long for their expectations to be met. This study aims at understanding how managerial practices of basic public schools, in relations with their interest groups (principal, supervisors, teachers, pedagogues, general service assistant, administrative officers, patrimonial agents, students' parents), take place. A multicase study was carried out in four schools, data were collected from documents, direct observation and evaluated by means of the content analysis technique, based on categories from Chanlat's (1996) participative management. Some findings were: (i) some stakeholders didn't know or participated in school management, (ii) the need to engage the community to access resources, (iii) conflicting goals regarding stakeholders and the school, (iv) the need to strengthen the communication among stakeholders to make the control and evaluation system more effective, (v) how it's necessary to engage stakeholders in the managerial process to obtain certain advantages.

N2  - Introduction Since the political revolution in 1932, the political party system in Thailand has developed incrementally, but internal party structures and local branch systems have not appeared as successful means to consolidate party structures. The absence of party rootedness in local constituencies has frequently resulted in the demise of parties. Although many major Thai political parties such as the New Aspiration Party (NAP), the Phalang Dharma Party (PDP) and the Democrat Party (DP) have claimed that they have established genuine local branches, those branches were set up primarily to benefit individual party leaders and to create the image of a mass-based party (King 1997: 23-5; Ockey 1994: 273 and Askew 2008: 327). Unlike party branches in more developed democracies such as those of Western Europe, many branches in Thailand, particularly those belonging to small parties, did not function effectively as local party units. They did not attempt to recruit more members or forge stronger party affiliation among party members. Nor did they routinely organize political activities at the local level or provide resources to support the party during elections. These weaknesses limit the role of local branches in voter mobilization. And yet, even though these local branches do not function effectively in politics, their numbers mushroom. What are the reasons behind those branch establishments? This chapter aims to examine the main factors that have contributed to the rapid formation of local branches across Thailand in order to understand the structural relationship between the party center and their local organizations. The analysis focuses on parties’ incentives for the formation of branches. I address the question of why party leaders have decided to establish a great number of local branches across the country even though it is usually deemed more effective to utilize their own personal networks to mobilize voters in elections (Darling 1971; Callahan and McCargo 1996; McCargo 1997; Ockey 2003). I pay specific attention to the DP’s branch promotion policy due to the rapidly increasing number of DP branches over time. This large number of DP branches distinguishes the party from other major political parties in Thai politics. As can be seen in Table 9.1, the DP has contributed a relatively large amount of human and material resources to the advancement of its branch promotion policy. During the early years after its formation in 1946, the DP only set up 11 branches, but by 2008 the local branch numbers had increased to 196 branches across the country.1 Most local branches had been disbanded together with their party during the military regimes. After the reemergence of democratic government, political parties, including the DP, reorganized their branches. In the past, the local party branch system was not widely developed by political parties. Scholars of Thai politics such as Kramol Thongthammachart (1966), Kachatpai Burutphat (1968), James Ockey (1994), Duncan McCargo (1997) and Pricha Hongkrilert (1981) have argued that Thai parties are dominated by professional politicians and technocrats, tend to be controlled by individual leaders, are subsidized by powerful figures or interest groups, and have no clear policy platforms. These characteristics of Thai parties left little room for the development of strong party organizations with large memberships and effectively developed local branch systems. Rather, this weak organizational structure led to the prevalence of clientelistic networks in which hua khanaen, or voting chiefs, play a key role. In order to win an election, candidates rely on their personal networks and the hua khanaen who are able to convince voters to elect a particular candidate in return for money (Ockey 2000: 83-5). These hua khanaen, including village headmen, factory owners and retired government officers, establish tightly knit relationships with party candidates. Their activities are generally limited to one or two villages. They support party candidates to conduct electoral campaigns and in many cases they help with channeling candidates’ financial resources to voters. It is not enough for candidates to spend money on vote-buying; it is also vital for hua khanaen to direct that money through the right channels.2 There are many reports of candidates spending large amounts of money, but failing to win elections as a result of having chosen the wrong hua khanaen. The close connection between candidates and hua khanaen is, therefore, essential in order to ensure the electoral victory of individual candidates. At the same time, these relationships foster the clientelistic networks between candidates and their hua khanaen. The prominence of clientelistic networks has made parties and their leaders reluctant to develop strong local branches as a tool for voter mobilization in elections. Candidates and parties tended to use the old style system in order to garner their votes in elections. Hence, local branches were only marginally important in the eyes of politicians and party leaders. Back in the 1980s, major parties such as NAP and PDP claimed to have established local branches as a means to build mass-based organizations, but those branches were not formally registered with the Ministry of Interior (MOI) at that time. In fact, many of those branches tended to serve as private offices of individual Members of Parliament, and only later were claimed as local party branches. They were not established by the party center. Instead, it was the party MPs who funded their establishment and administrative affairs (McCargo 1993: 20; King 1996: 56). Subsidies allotted by MPs frequently allowed those MPs to control these branches. Several branch officers were also the MP’s vote canvasser. Subsequently, these branches tended to garner support for MPs rather than cultivating votes for the party organization. The clientelistic networks between branch members and MPs weakened the political party affiliation among branch members. More importantly, this relationship often resulted in the decline of those branches if MPs defected from the party. The significance of party branches, however, was widely discussed again after the promulgation of the 1997 Constitution and the 1998 Political Party Act. Numerous local party branches were established by small and large political parties. This increasing number of branches was partly a result of the requirement of branch formation in the Party Act (see Section 29, the 1998 Political Party Act) and the promulgation of the Political Party Development Fund (PDF) - state subsidies for the development of political parties and branches - in the 1998 Political Party Act (Kris Aungwong 2004). Major parties at that time, such as the Thai Rak Thai (TRT) Party and the Thai Nation Party (TNP), set up new branches during this period, if only to fulfill the bare minimum of the formal requirements.3 Moreover, numerous smaller and less affluent parties established local branches in order to maximize their share from the PDF (Krit Auewong, 2005). Many small parties set up more than one branch per constituency and a large number of small parties controlled more than 100 branches across the nation. As shown in Figure 9.1, more than 1, 000 branches were established after the promulgations of the 1998 Political Party Act and the PDF. In 2001, there were 1, 611 branches, approximately 900 branches more than in 1999. The number of new branches kept rising until 2004. By 2005, however, the branch numbers declined again due to stricter Election Commission regulations on branch formation and the revision of the monetary allocation formula. According to the new regulations written in 2004, political parties can no longer include all their branches in calculations for final state subsidies. Only branches that passed the evaluation criteria of the Election Commission can be included in the allocation formula to calculate the final total of state subsidies. In 2009, only six of 36 political parties received state subsidies due to their branch numbers. The PDF, therefore, was an important stimulus for the rapid expansion of local branches after the promulgation of the 1998 Political Party Act. While the PDF encouraged small parties to set up local branches, it is less clear whether these state subsidies also influenced the formation of branches in the larger parties such as the DP. In this chapter, I emphasize that the PDF was indeed important, but it was only one of three underlying significant factors that contributed to a previously unexplained increase in the number of local party branches in the DP. The other two factors are the party’s intention to expand its rootedness at local level and intra-party competition. In the following paragraphs I will analyze these factors and their effects on the DP’s branch promotion policy. Moreover, I will make comparisons with two other major political parties, the Thai Rak Thai Party (now reincarnated as the Pheu Thai Party) and the Thai Nation Party (now known as the Thai Nation Development Party). I underscore the implications of these three factors for the weakness of party organization and the existence of clientelistic networks within the party organization. I will conclude that with the exception of branches in the south and in Bangkok, many DP branches do not function effectively as party offices at the constituency level. Many DP branches were set up for other purposes - representing the mass party image, securing the power of individual leaders within the party and maximizing the party’s share of state subsidies - instead of promoting the party’s rootedness at the local level. © 2013 selection and editorial material, Dirk Tomsa and Andreas Ufen.

N2  - In this paper I describe how self-advocacy has grown in the Czech Republic. I talk about how services for people with learning disabilities have begun to change in the last few years. This is because voluntary groups have lobbied and campaigned for change. I learned about self-advocacy during a visit to the UK in the 1990s. I went back to the Czech Republic and asked some service users I knew whether they would like to start the country's first self-advocacy group. They agreed and since then the group has grown and developed new networks. The group has also received some financial and practical support from the biggest parents'organization for people with learning disabilities in the Czech Republic. A number of conferences have been organized by self-advocates, including one at the Czech Republic Parliament. Other people are now starting to take notice of what self-advocates are saying. Support for self-advocacy is an important issue for its future in the Czech Republic. © 2006 BILD Publications.

N2  - Judicial independence is fundamental to democracy. It is in that context that this paper considers whether the existing constitutional and legislative mechanisms provide sufficient judicial independence to South African judges. In so doing, the paper focuses on impartiality, judicial appointments and security of tenure. It also discusses the sensitive matter of complaints and disciplinary proceedings against judges and their removal from office. The issue of the remuneration of judges is also explored. In discussing the challenges facing judicial independence some incidents that have appeared to compromise such independence are highlighted. These include the controversial appointments of Advocate Mpshe as an acting judge in the North West Province in 2010 and Judge Heath as the Head of the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) in 2011. The never-ending controversy surrounding the Cape Judge President John Hlophe and his alleged attempts to improperly influence two Constitutional Court judges in a case involving President Jacob Zuma is also highlighted. Another issue that has brought judicial independence into sharp focus is the June 2015 visit to South Africa of Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, who was on a warrant of arrest from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for genocide and war crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan. A decision by the North Gauteng High Court on his presence in South Africa and the attacks on the judiciary made by various government officials as a result are discussed. Several conclusions are drawn but in the main, it is generally concluded that the constitutional and legislative framework adopted by South Africa sufficiently insulates judges from improper influence. However, there have been several notable challenges that particularly relate to judicial appointments and how the JSC has handled certain matters. Irresponsible and uninformed political statements by politicians and unwarranted political attacks on the judiciary by government are also a source of great concern. These challenges could and should be construed as threats to judicial independence, and need to be comprehensively and properly addressed. © 2015, North-West Unversity. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives To examine how transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) tried to penetrate the Bulgarian cigarette market and influence tobacco excise tax policy after the fall of communism and during Bulgaria's accession to the European Union (EU). Design Analysis of internal tobacco industry documents supplemented by analysis of press coverage, tobacco industry journals, market reports and key informant interviews. Results TTCs have been involved in cigarette smuggling to and through Bulgaria since at least 1975 and used smuggling as a market-entry strategy. National tobacco company Bulgartabac appears to have been involved in smuggling its own cigarettes from and reimporting them to Bulgaria. Since Bulgaria's accession to the EU opened the market to the TTCs, TTCs have exaggerated the scale of the illicit trade to successfully convince politicians and public health experts that tax increases lead to cigarette smuggling. Yet, sources point to TTCs' continued complicity in cigarette smuggling to and through Bulgaria between 2000 and 2010. TTCs aimed to influence the Bulgarian tobacco excise tax regime, import duties and pricing mechanism, but appear to have been less successful than in other former communist countries in part due to the co-existence of a state-owned tobacco company. Undisclosed meetings between the tobacco industry and government ministers and officials are ongoing despite Bulgaria being a party to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Conclusions The TTCs continued involvement in smuggling suggests that deals in 2004, 2007 and 2010 which the European Commission has reached with TTCs to address cigarette smuggling are inadequate. The TTCs' continued access to policymakers suggests that the FCTC is not being properly implemented.

N2  - Can international actors build effective state bureaucracies in postwar countries? While the literature on state institutions suggests they are best built under local ownership, this article shows how international actors in collaboration with local actors managed to build two effective state bureaucracies in postwar Kosovo: the police force and the customs service. Contrary to the article’s Hypothesis 1 on local ownership, international actors insulated the effective bureaucracies from political and societal influences in order to prevent them from becoming sites of patronage. Thus, these institutions built on meritocratic recruitment and promotion. Employing a comparative research design, the article utilizes national survey data as well as data from 150 semistructured interviews conducted during ten months of fieldwork in Kosovo. By contrasting the state’s constituent bureaucracies, which vary in effectiveness, and thus avoiding the reduction of the state to a unitary abstract actor, this research offers a fresh perspective on postwar state building. Furthermore, it contributes three innovative sets of indicators to measure effective bureaucracies: mission fulfillment, penalization of corruption, and responsiveness to the public.

N2  - Corruption and its effects on society are among the frequent topics in academic literature. The same applies to the influence of corruption on trust, whether interpersonal or institutional. But there is no specific research on the impact of corruption on trust in civil servants. Especially in the European post-communist countries, which after 1989 showed institutional weakness and politicization of public administration, it is necessary to ask whether the accession to the European Union and the adoption of the civil service laws helped to reduce corruption in the eyes of citizens and mainly to increase their trust in civil servants. However, the analysis carried out in seven post-communist countries reveals that people still do not trust the civil servants much. In addition, public not only perceives a significant number of civil servants as corrupt, but even encounters corrupt cases while dealing with them. Corruption is also a phenomenon that reduces citizens' trust in civil servants. © 2020 Institute of Political Studies. All rights reserved.

N2  - After the May Coup of 1926, a few dozen (at least 43) professional officers, enjoying the trust of Jozef Pilsudski, were admitted to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs as full-time officials. About half of this group were military intelligence officers in the past. They left the army by orders of their superiors. Along with military attaches officially employed in the Ministry and residents of military intelligence working in the agencies of the MFA, there were over one hundred of them. They formed a noticeable group in the Ministry which in the 30s employed 1300 officials (full-time and contract). And because they usually held high-ranking positions (including the highest) - also an influential group. Changes can be seen in the MFA after 1933 indicating the transfer of military models: strictly enforced demand for professional secrecy, influence of superiors on the choice of a spouse, employment of only Polish citizens, reduction of reporting and bureaucracy, transfer to other positions without consideration of the will of the interested party, etc. The style of management of diplomacy by Minister Jozef Beck, far from collegiality, somewhat authoritarian, can be associated with patterns prevailing in the army. The officers saw making the Ministry more efficient tool to implement the will of Marshal Pilsudski as the main value of their presence in the MFA. The ``centralisation'' of the decision-making process, corresponding to the traditional military structure, was highly valued. Civilian officials pointed to the negative effects of work of the military men: the dominance of patterns harmful in diplomacy, such as the lack of respect for individualism, combating criticism (even of unjust decisions), worship of obedience (even against common sense), the lack of professionalism and good manners.

N2  - Elizabeth Anderson argues for civic as against distributive egalitarianism. I agree with civic egalitarianism understood as a public ideal, and welcome her interest in the sociological conditions under which it may best flourish. But I argue that she is mistaken in opposing what she calls 'hierarchies of esteem' and proposing that where the egalitarian ideal has insufficient hold on civil society it should be implemented by an efficient bureaucracy. We should learn a different lesson from Max Weber. What the ideal of equality needs is not more bureaucracy but more influential advocacy - and that requires healthy 'hierarchies of esteem'. © 2008 The Aristotelian Society.

N2  - By drawing a division between citizens and noncitizens, migration policies speak to implicit definitions of what makes a good citizen. Commonly accepted definitions of citizenship are produced not only through explicit political discourse but also through the everyday actions of state agencies. The selection of the “worthy” migrants that those street-level bureaucracies operate is deeply rooted in interpretations of the nation's boundaries. In this article, I examine this everyday production of citizenship and nationhood by focusing on the case of Polish migration policies approached through the lens of an ethnographic study of street-level bureaucracies. While the rapid politicization of immigration in this country since 2015 resembles a major shift, an inquiry into the practices of policy implementation invites interrogations concerning continuities between past and present state practices, as well as concerning the definitions of citizens and of “worthy” immigrants that were and are prevalent within Polish institutions.

N2  - During recent years, the concept of European civil society has gained increasing popularity. The European Institutions themselves have developed a discourse on civil society and civil dialogue. Institutional interests have shaped this discourse. Reframing the normative context for EU democracy, this discourse suits some institutions better than others. In particular, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Commission have made recourse to it; the former to redefine its proper role and combat the risk of marginalisation within the European institutional set-up; the latter first to build support for policy initiatives in the social sphere and subsequently to respond to the legitimacy crisis of the Brussels’ bureaucracy. These institutional interests have inspired a conceptualisation of civil society as ‘functional participation’ and ‘functional representation’ rather than as ‘politicisation’ or ‘decentralisation’. However, while the Commission and the ESC have had some success in selling their discourse, to be successful in the longer run some problematic assumptions of the discourse should be tackled and both the different rationales for civil society involvement as well as the multi-level character of European civil society and European policymaking should be taken into account. © 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - The European Commission is an organization which has come to fascinate or repulse a range of national politicians, journalists and social scientists. In contrast to the prevailing image of the Commission as a 'bureaucrat's paradise', however, and by using the results of original research, this book deliberately sets out to investigate this organization's relationship to politics. It does so first by developing a variety of case-studies (health, development aid, preparations for Eastern enlargement, etc.) as a means of studying the relationships, networks and interdependencies which link commissioners and Commission officials to national politicians, civil servants and interest groups. Second, by looking in detail at how the Commission publicizes its work, notably through producing public information and liaising with the media, fresh light is shone upon the complex question of the Commission's legitimacy. Politics and the European Commission provides a framework for generating new information about, and interpretations of, the power struggles at the heart of the EU. © 2004 Andy Smith for selection and editorial matter.

N2  - Are public policy programs in Mexico ensuring students receive the correct public finance and budgeting training to cut corruption, corporatism, clientelism, and other plaguing patronage elements? Are these programs also teaching public financial management to ensure accountability, results, and responsiveness for our future government officials? Are we creating more integrative and ethical public financial managers with the appropriate knowledge of public financial systems? In order to address these questions, this study compiled general and curricular information of 68 masters's programs in public administration across the 32 states in Mexico, covering a total of 1,138 courses. To conduct the analysis, this article identifies five complementary lenses for evaluating and teaching public finance and budgeting. The authors argue that, although nearly all Masters in Public Policy and Public Administration programs in Mexico teach public finance, there is a wide variation in the lenses, tools, and techniques used across these programs. Furthermore, the scope of this curricular component is not sufficient to face the challenges of the country and its regions, nor to address the diverse social needs, local contexts, and government institutions, and labor market for public employees.

N2  - This article examines how the political activities of antebellum U.S. engineering officers on behalf of the Engineer Company demonstrate the range of mid-nineteenth-century military professionalism. These efforts indicate their sense of a professional responsibility to provide the nation with the military capability to defend itself, but this lobbying was circumscribed by the engineers' awareness that as officers they had to remain subordinate to the civil government and its policies. This tension can be seen in the methods officers selected for their lobbying and in the internal politicking within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over the company's proper role.

N2  - Under what conditions are presidents more likely to remove senior defense officials from office? Using a novel data set of all senior U.S. defense officials, both civilian and uniformed military from 1947 to 2021, this article explores whether anticipated support in Congress, partisan factors, or institutional protections for the military affect observed patterns of removal for defense officials. The results suggest that presidents are more likely to remove their own appointees (or their co-partisans' appointees), but provide little evidence that presidents premise removal on anticipated partisan support for a replacement nominee in Congress. Moreover, the results suggest that military officials may have some insulation from politicization by strong forms of removal, though that protection may weaken an important aspect of civilian control of the military, the threat of punishment by removal, raising profound questions for how civilian control endures.

N2  - This article argues that the transparency regime regulating the activities of lobbyists in the UK and the devolved administrations fails to address the core problems of political lobbying and should be replaced. This is particularly important following Brexit because the regulatory landscape will change significantly in the years to come. The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014 establishes a registry-based system of regulating lobbyists seeking to communicate with the government in Westminster. The Scotland (Lobbying) Act 2016 establishes a similar system, with calls for a lobbying register in Wales also growing. Analyses of existing laws reveal several flaws with those registry-based systems resulting in inadequate levels of transparency. To remedy the shortfall and to get transparency right, this article argues for two changes. First, a more robust register for professional lobbyists premised on greater transparency that is harmonised for Westminster and the devolved administrations. Secondly, the creation of a centralised public website acting as the official forum for advocacy tied to specific legislative proposals.

N2  - A large share of decision makers in modern democratic systems are appointed. To what degree do those officials represent constituents? Representation in this case is determined in part by the extent to which constituents influence the appointment process. This article examines the influence of women's organized interests and constituency preferences on Supreme Court confirmation votes. With topics such as sexual harassment, privacy, and Roe v. Wade looming large, gender politics became a salient issue during confirmation battles in the late 1980s and early 1990s and has remained so since. Original data from the contentious appointments of Justices David Souter, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor are analyzed. Results confirm that women's organized interests and popular preferences have an impact on contentious nominations. Implications for popular influences on appointments and for representation in government writ large are discussed.

N2  - When are strategic appointments useful in curbing policy bias from ex-post negotiation between state agencies and special interest groups? Bertelli and Feldmann (J Public Adm Res Theory 17: 19-38, 2007) provide an insightful analysis of the issue within a full information model of presidential appointments. This paper examines whether and how their findings extend to a world of policy uncertainty and asymmetric information, which rationalizes delegation in the first place. We establish that the occurrence of policy-relevant equilibrium lobbying crucially relies on interest groups' leverage over the appointment game between higher-level institutions. Remarkably, bureaucratic lobbying may prove highly non-neutral with separated powers even when a candidate agency is agreed upon. In some circumstances (e.g., recess appointments in the US), by contrast, strategic appointments fully offset interest group influence in either form of government (unified versus divided), a finding in line with the conventional theory of delegation.

N2  - Despite variations among Southern European state bureaucracies, there are certain common features of the Southern European bureaucratic model, such as political clientelism at the higher echelons of the bureaucracy and at the entry level; an uneven distribution of resources and infrastructure in the public sector; legal rigidity and excessive legalism; and-with the exception of Spain-lack of an administrative elite. Corruption and inefficiency are also common, but their extent is debatable. During democratic transition and consolidation, Southern European bureaucracies were not "cleansed" from collaborators of the authoritarian regimes. In the period of democratic persistence, most attempts at implementing public management reforms in Southern Europe failed. However, decentralization progressed immensely it Italy and Spain, but hardly in Greece and Portugal. Except for Spain, professionalism was not achieved. Even though extensive politicization persists, the traditional features of South European bureaucracies have started fading.

N2  - Traditionally, before the advent of socialist regimes, the state in Southeastern Europe was overpowering and distant, that is, aloof from the demands of certain social strata and social categories. Under socialism, the state became omnipresent, regulating many aspects of the life of its citizens, and thus ceased to be distant. After 1989, the state in SEE has remained big and has become weak. It has been unable to counter organized crime and to provide better services to the people. A few small case studies illustrate these claims. The Bulgarian public administration used to be very politicized even before the rise of the Communist Party to power. Since the transition to democracy, administrative reform has been very slow, while extreme politicization has continued. However, in the late 1990s new laws reorganizing the administration were passed. The case of Yugoslavia is different, particularly since this is a federal state. Under Milosevic, the administration as a whole became very rigid and, in many instances, corrupted. Kosovo has been administered partly by the local government and partly by UNMIK. The cases of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Kosovo share some common traits, related to the problematic selection, compensation and training of civil servants. Administrative reform should primarily address the issue of corruption and should also be linked to the strengthening of democratic institutions, including the access of citizens to state services. © 2002 Frank Cass & Co.

N2  - How is partisan polarization affecting the modern administrative state. Research suggests that despite a polarized Congress and a (somewhat) polarized electorate, agency policy choices do not seem to be moving systematically toward the extremes. Some combination of moderating effects seem to be at work, including the effect of divided government on appointments, agency preferences driven by moderate statutory mandates and/or the norms of issue networks, and (at times) the influence of ideologically moderate presidents on the size of the gridlock interval. The Trump administration may represent a departure from these norms: conservatives in the Trump coalition may be freer to pursue policies disfavored by a majority because of populist loyalty to the administration. Regardless, polarization-induced congressional gridlock poses ongoing challenges for the administrative state. Agencies must address problems within their jurisdiction in the absence of congressional input, using statutes that may have been poorly designed for the purpose. Courts will continue to struggle, case by case, with the implications for the constitutional legitimacy of agency policymaking.

N2  - The nature and quality of governmental action in a democracy depend critically on the relationship between citizens and government, which in turn depends on the mechanisms available for interaction, the organizational capacity of citizens to voice their concerns and wishes, and the willingness of governments to listen. In viewing the state as a set of institutions and social relations, most of which are sanctioned and supported by a legal system that controls a spatial territory, Guillermo O'Donnell (2005) argues for the need to take account of three dimensions: first, the state as a set of bureaucracies and agencies with responsibilities to achieve or protect some aspect of the public or general good; second, the state as a legal system that along with the bureaucracy is the ultimate guarantor of the predictability of the greater public good; and third, the state as seeking to be a focus of collective identity for all or most of the inhabitants. Modern democracies grew up within this notion of a nation-state and not outside it. The socially constructed notion of citizenship is a consequence of this process and not a precursor; it is both an expression of rights and at the same time an ascriptive reminder of the nonvoluntary nature of territoriality. How far any state has gone in advancing along these three dimensions will vary considerably, and, as O'Donnell (2005) rightly concluded: In Latin America, we can confidently, albeit sadly, assert that we are dealing with states that in most cases score low in these three dimensions. The poor efficacy of their bureaucracies has been amply documented. The scarce and biased penetration of their legal system has been less noted, although I and more recently other authors have registered it. However the most ignored of these deficiencies is the third: The low, and often decreasing, credibility of these states as true enactors of the common good for their nations. (26) The (re)turn to civil society in the development literature of the 1990s was in part a response to this same concern and its implicit question: Who, then, speaks and acts for the common good, and how can state credibility and performance be improved? As we have noted elsewhere in this volume, there is a common (if rather "rosy") assumption that decentralization improves government-citizen relations by bringing government closer to the day-to-day issues that constitute the territorially rooted features of collective life and that the government is by nature good and seeks to serve in the widest public interest. Of course, even a moment's refl ection should suggest that this is not necessarily the case and that particular issues, actors, and moments in history can combine in very uncertain ways, especially within the federal model. Would the U.S. civil rights movement have been better off in the South if it had not been able to count on centralized federal support but instead had depended upon local state policy makers? Would Brazil's indigenous population have made any progress in land demarcation if the issue had been left to state and municipal policy makers? And would Mexico's decentralization process have occurred from the bottom up without federal executive leadership to pursue an overhaul of article 123 of the Constitution? We doubt it. On the other hand, in some areas of action decentralization has clearly facilitated the voicing of concerns and progress on issues that address the general good. In the same way, the assumption that "civil society" offers some a priori leadership in these processes must also be considered with caution. Does democracy strengthen civil society or does civil society strengthen democracy, and what role does decentralization play in shaping the relationship? Or are they independent of each other? Indeed, we might ask, what is civil society in our different countries, and whose civil society is it? In this chapter we examine these issues in relation to two broad questions. First, given the current trend of decentralization and democratic opening, what is happening to subnational civil society? Second, is civil society a leader or a laggard in relation to decentralization? As we will show, the situation is rather different in each country. We begin with a brief discussion of civil society, citizenship, and rights to identify some of the aforementioned differences across our three case study countries, which will partly be refl ected in the empirical data presented on the existence and activities of different types of associations and interest groups. This is followed by observations on forums and movements that are emerging from within civil society itself. The chapter concludes with some observations on political culture and party membership. We conclude that overall there is some call for optimism regarding civil society's presence within the different arenas and action spaces of the subnational state, but that many doubts remain, especially regarding the effective institutionalizing of broad public spheres of participation and civic action.

N2  - Water resources are under increased pressure in almost all parts of the world. In such circumstances, it is also common to have conflicts between different water sectors (for instance, tourism vs. environmental use; municipal and industrial supply vs. agricultural water use, etc.), and interest groups. In most cases, related problems could be efficiently solved through public participation and the involvement of stakeholders. Traditional public participation in water management is mostly focused on problem-solving, rather than on other important contexts such as: stakeholders’ understanding of the problem; motivation (willingness) to participate; preferences; understanding the solving methodology; and expectations that the participatory process will lead to the desired solution(s). An approach that has been proven to successfully take into account most of these concerns in managing water-related participatory problems is known as Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM). In this paper, the authors use GTM to analyse data collected within the previous study of stakeholders’ selection and prioritization in managing the water resources of the Krivaja River basin in Serbia. Extensive data sets include detailed information about stakeholders, a description of the catchment characteristics, and the perception of public participation provided by questionnaires distributed and collected within a six-month period. The results obtained by GTM show that there are more similarities with results obtained in developing countries in terms of the distinction between official and non-official attitudes and views, the objectives of PP and the justification for introducing PP.

N2  - INDIA HAS PREMISED its nuclear strategy on developing an effective deterrent while at the same time pushing aggressively for a worldwide rollback of nuclear arsenals. Indian strategy, then, derives both from practical military concerns-the stark reality of nuclear neighbors to the subcontinent's east and west-and from a fervent, longstanding, apparently sincere devotion to the ideals of nonproliferation and disarmament. Scientific, technical, and doctrinal advances are critical to the military element of strategy, whereas forceful diplomacy carries forward the nonproliferation element. The dualism inherent in Indian thinking about nuclear weapons, which blends idealism uneasily with realism, helps explain the sometimes-quixotic character of Indian strategy. Like China and most other Asian continental powers, India confronts a complex, multidirectional, multifaceted strategic environment. Its traditional rival, Pakistan, lies to the northwest, and China is to the northeast. Rivals could station ballistic missile submarines in nearby waters or use the Indian Ocean's sea lanes to transport weapons-related matériel, menacing Indian security directly or abetting the proliferation of nuclear weapons to "rogue regimes" or nonstate groups. New Delhi's strategy, consequently, must come to terms with myriad factors. This chapter reviews four clusters of questions pertaining to Indian nuclear strategy in this strategic environment, with the aim of peering ahead to discern how New Delhi may manage strategy in the second nuclear age. One strand in India's atomic past that stands out in our account is bureaucratic politics and culture. Institutions promise to shape the making and execution of strategy, much as they have since the inception of the Indian nuclear program. Agencies bring distinctive worldviews to their endeavors. These views often clash during interagency initiatives, shaping-and at times misshaping-the products of these organizations' joint labors. The German sociologist Max Weber shed light on the benefits and drawbacks of bureaucracy. He depicted the bureaucratic method of organization as a marvel of efficiency, one of the cornerstones of the modern administrative state. He viewed bureaucracy as a kind of mechanical extension of the will of the sovereign, implying that these institutions could be relied on to carry out rulers' directives both swiftly and efficiently. The "monocratic," or highly centralized, bureaucracy earned special plaudits from Weber, who maintained that, because it concentrated power in the hands of a few, accountable officials, was "finally superior both in intensive efficiency and in the scope of its operations."1 It was rational in a way that more traditional modes of organization were not. Weber likened bureaucratic organizations to engineering systems; thus he insisted that the "fully developed bureaucratic apparatus compares with other organizations exactly as does the machine with the non-mechanical modes of production." Such an apparatus boasted such virtues as precision, speed, "strict subordination," and a "reduction of friction and of material and personal costs."2 "The choice," he insisted, was "only that between bureaucracy and dilettantism in the field of administration." To be sure, enthusiasts of modern public administration did acknowledge, usually in a roundabout fashion, that bureaucratic institutions had some intrinsic shortcomings. Although they were well suited to performing routine functions, large organizations found it exceedingly difficult to alter their methods, even when the need for such change seemed compelling. Weber testified indirectly to the inflexibility of administrative institutions; he thus admitted that, once "fully established, bureaucracy is among those social structures which are the hardest to destroy."4 The individual official was "only a small cog in a ceaselessly moving mechanism which prescribes to him an essentially fixed route of march. The official is entrusted with specialized tasks, and normally the mechanism cannot be put into motion or arrested by him, but only from the very top." Only top leaders, then, could realistically hope to steer administrative organizations in a different direction. Because of their training and career incentives, lesser officials were invariably jealous of the interests of the overall organization. AsWeber explained, "the individual bureaucrat is, above all, forged to the common interest of all the functionaries in the perpetuation of the apparatus," sometimes at the expense of the larger national interest.6 These elements made administrative institutions, built as they were on the "settled orientation of man for observing the accustomed rules and regulations," extraordinarily resistant to change.7 Indeed, concluded Weber, modern administrative organization made real political revolution, "in the sense of the forceful creation of entirely new formations of authority," practically impossible. Weber did pay tribute, albeit in an offhand and cursory way, to the notion that elected officials could impose their will on bureaucratic institutions through judicious personnel appointments. He posited that appointing carefully selected individuals to preside over the bureaucracy was better than electing them.9 The wisely chosen official acted as a "Caesar," or "a free trustee of the masses.10 By installing like-minded officials in the bureaucracy, elected officials stood at least some chance of inducing a course change in organizations that were highly resistant to outside pressure-even pressure from their formal superiors. At times, Indian political leaders have found it difficult to bend government agencies to their will in order to rationalize nuclear strategy. How they will fare at installing strong leadership-yoking these institutions to top-level policy and strategy-promises to be a key metric of Indian progress in fielding an effective deterrent. And whether they can design efficient institutional arrangements and install the right personnel to lead and manage them will be one arbiter of India's nuclear future. India's strong tradition of civil supremacy over military matters should help, but success is far from foreordained.

N2  - This paper discusses health sector reforms and what they have meant for sexual and reproductive health advocacy in low-income countries. Beginning in the late 1980s, it outlines the main macro-economic shifts and policy trends which affect countries dependent on external aid and the main health sector reforms taking place. It then considers the implications of successive macro-economic and reform agendas for reproductive and sexual health advocacy. International debate today is focused on the conditions necessary for socio-economic development and the role of governments in these, and how to improve the performance of health sector bureaucracies and delivery systems. A critical challenge is how to re-negotiate the policy and financial space for sexual and reproductive health services within national health systems and at international level. Advocacy for sexual and reproductive health has to tread the line between a vision of reproductive health for all and action on priority conditions, which means articulating an informed view on needs and priorities. In pressing for greater funding for reproductive health, advocates need to find an appropriate balance between concern with health systems strengthening and service delivery and programmes, and create alliances with progressive health sector reformers.

N2  - This article provides a methodological tool for studying central civil service management structures (CCSMS) and their role in de-politicizing the civil service, thereby contributing to evidence-based civil service management. This tool can be used in comparative studies of CCSMS across, but also within countries, since civil service management functions are often split between several central organizations in one country. The comparative study of CCSMS is particularly useful for contemporary policy makers in EU member states, who currently face the challenge of reforming civil service systems due to EU pressure. There is therefore an urgent need to establish which type of central structure would effectively support the EU's favored values of professionalizing and de-politicizing the civil service. Stemming from theory on organizational autonomy, our typology focuses on two key dimensions of the CCSMS that support these values: decision-making autonomy over individual civil servants and structural accountability. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.

N2  - Politicization of top civil service in Central and Eastern Europe has been discussed among both academics and practitioners for some time now. It has been concluded that the politicization of civil servants has resurged since the accession into the EU, which has lead to a great deal of uncertainty among civil service. Nevertheless, the evidence on turnover is mostly stemming from interviews and expert survey since CEE countries lack basic data on HR functions. This paper wants to address this gap and looks into turnover data (both scope and depth) among top civil service officials at the six Slovak ministries between 2004 and 2014. During this period, the Slovak government was completely changed three times. The work describes the connection between electoral cycles and top civil servants replacements. The research has shown that election cycles are important determinant for the replacements. Nevertheless, not only electoral cycles are important in the turnover. The paper has shown that the role of minister personality has an impact on replacements and turnover rates. Also, the research has shown the existence of ``stable units{''} within otherwise politicized ministry where the top civil servants change only on a minimal level.

It follows the occurrence of the phenomenon in relation to misuse of power for personal profit and provides an overview of theses formulated by political science authors on corruption and misuse of power (e.g. Rose-Ackerman, Warren, Johnston, Klitgaard) in relation to public administration and policy making. Examples and documentation of Slovak experience is provided, particularly in the field of politico-administrative relations and from the exercise of discretionary power of the street level bureaucracy. Corrupted behaviour usually arises in the environment of public power misuse, where institutional and legal framework does not provide sufficient opportunity for the expression of plurality of opinions which consequently is reflected in the unequal participatory access of various economic and political elites as well as interest groups.

N2  - Patronage is typically studied following government terminations when political parties appoint their nominees into the state administration. However, patronage is understudied in cases when a change of minister takes place without government termination. Taking individual government ministers as the units of analysis, we identify four modalities of ministerial alterations: replacing, successive, incumbent, and switching ministers. We show that politicization occurs under “replacing ministers” following government termination, but the bureaucratic turnover is equally high under “successive ministers.” That suggests that patronage can be seen as an individualized power resource of autonomous ministers who exercise influence independently of their political parties. © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - This article examines the efforts of political and legal actors to scale
back access to the courts and judicial authority in the decades since
the rights revolution of the 1950s and 1960s. Despite the importance and
consequences that such efforts have had for the judicial system and
rights protections in the United States, public law and American
Political Development (APD) scholars have only begun to study this
phenomenon within existing theories of institutional change. Through an
examination of efforts to reform procedural rules that govern courtroom
access, adjudication, and potential remedies, this article presents
evidence that both builds on and pushes this scholarship in new
directions. In contrast to law and APD scholars who have promoted a
`regime politics' model of judicial authority that focuses on the
interests of national elected officials and Supreme Court majorities,
this article finds that actors pursuing retrenchment come from both
within and outside the judiciary, evidencing a robust set of individuals
and interests (far beyond judges and politicians) who might be
considered ``judicial{''} actors. Building on and complicating current
understandings of the politics of retrenchment, moreover, I find that
the groups involved in judicial retrenchment change significantly over
time, are motivated by more than partisan backlash, and that the
availability of malleable institutional ``rules{''} enhances the
likelihood of their success. Finally, I find that the processes of
judicial retrenchment are distinctive but not static, unfolding in a
series of methods for attempted change that are not only path dependent,
but also path breaking.

N2  - Over the international decade for women, 1975-1985, there were many dialogues, lobbying activities, legislative and policy mandates, yet barely a dent was made in the redistribution of resources and values from men to women. The oft-quoted statement from the 1980 Copenhagen Programme of Action starkly summarizes how one-half the world's population performs two-thirds of the world's work, receives one-tenth of world income, and owns less than 1 percent of world property.1 At least at the aggregate level, little progress has been made in dismantling institutionalized male privilege. Such institutionalized privilege is deeply embedded in the state2 and grounded in a western cultural heritage3 that has spread throughout the world in different degrees. Prospects for redistributive change look grim. At the same time, changes over the past century would appear to set the stage for gradual redistribution. First, states seek to legitimize themselves through public policy and participation-based accountability. State policies intrude, for better or worse, into a so-called private sphere in which women are located. Participation expands to include women as voters, group advocates, and decision makers.4 Second, a veritable explosion of women's organizational activity and political agenda setting transpired over the women's decade. Many activists hope to take a concrete feminist agenda into the bureaucracy and thereby broaden state accountability to women. Over the decade, what the United Nations terms "national machineries" for the advancement of women have been promoted, such that 120 were counted by 19805 and 90 percent of governments were covered by 1985.6 If the aim is to get a female foot in the door and work from within, a better understanding is needed of what approaches work best in which settings. More than one-half of the resolutions of Forward Looking Strategies, from the 1985 end-of-the-decade conference in Nairobi, call for action from governments, ranging from equalizing access to education and removing stereotypes from the media to providing credit and land ownership to women farmers.7 Yet these are the very same governments that have heretofore perpetuated the kind of gendered policies that disempower women within gendered bureaucratic organizations. Should women work in, with, or against the state? Can state bureaucracies empower women? States respond to calls for gender redistribution in varying ways; comparisons of institutions, their cultural, political, and economic contexts, and their inhabitants' prevailing ideologies should tell us why. Contributors in this book explore women's politics and programs in the bureaucracy, as well as the implementation processes. At minimum, this exploration leads to a focus on both attitudes and structures: the bureaucrats and their ideologies of gender and of household relations, and their interactions with the institutional settings in which they work. We need to know more about men who dominate decision making in the bureaucracy and how they vary in diverse institutional settings. At the same time, we need to ask whether women will infuse a new sort of politics into male-oriented bureaucracy. Women have entered the realms of bureaucratic politics, and women's organizations increasingly form part of bureaucratic constituencies. Will women's very presence on the inside help women on the outside? Will women encourage bureaucracy to operate according to its Weberian "ideal" fashion, that is, in a neutral or gender-neutral fashion? (And is that a "good"?) Or does the hierarchical ordering of dominant-subordinate relationships in bureaucracy mire any prospects for gender redistribution? Some feminist theorists have argued that bureaucratic means are incompatible with feminist ends8 and that the male-oriented state cannot accommodate or respond to women.9 This book takes the first step toward comparative analysis of gender redistributive policy by looking at its practices in international, governmental, and nongovernmental institutions in a wide variety of national and cultural contexts. This introductory essay examines the existing literature on bureaucratic movement toward gender redistribution, which suggests a grim scenario for upcoming decades. A discussion of "gendered bureaucracy" is then put forward to frame and explain the phenomenon in political terms, After that, the chapter explores possibilities for change. The closing contains an overview of the papers in the book, though discussion of their contents is woven into the body of this essay as well. First, however, the connections between gender, development, and the state are laid out. © 2010 by Temple University Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - In this compelling study, Rena Steinzor highlights the ways in which the government, over the past twenty years, has failed to protect children from harm caused by toxic chemicals. She believes these failures-under-funding, excessive and misguided use of cost/benefit analysis, distortion of science, and devolution of regulatory authority-have produced a situation in which harm that could be reduced or eliminated instead persists. Steinzor states that, as a society, we are neglecting our children's health to an extent that we would find unthinkable as individual parents, primarily due to the erosion of the government's role in protecting public health and the environment. At this pace, she asserts, our children will inherit a planet under grave threat. We can arrest these developments if a critical mass of Americans become convinced that these problems are urgent and the solutions are near at hand. By focusing on three specific case studies-mercury contamination through the human food chain, perchlorate (rocket fuel) in drinking water, and the effects of ozone (smog) on children playing outdoors-Steinzor creates an analysis grounded in law, economics, and science to prove her assertions about the existing dysfunctional system. Steinzor then recommends a concise and realistic series of reforms that could reverse these detrimental trends and serve as a blueprint for restoring effective governmental intervention. She argues that these recommendations offer enough material to guide government officials and advocacy groups toward prompt implementation, for the sake of America's-and the world's-future generations.

N2  - It is generally assumed that the Constitution requires the Senate to vote to confirm the President's nominees to principal federal offices. This Essay argues, to the contrary, that when the President nominates an individual to a principal executive branch position, the Senate's failure to act on the nomination within a reasonable period of time can and should be construed as providing the Senate's tacit or implied advice and consent to the appointment. On this understanding, although the Senate can always withhold its constitutionally required consent by voting against a nominee, the Senate cannot withhold its consent indefinitely through the expedient of failing to vote on the nominee one way or the other. Although this proposal seems radical, and certainly would upset longstanding assumptions, the Essay argues that this reading of the Appointments Clause would not contravene the constitutional text, structure, or history. The Essay further argues that, at least under some circumstances, reading the Constitution to construe Senate inaction as implied consent to an appointment would have desirable consequences in light of deteriorating norms of Senate collegiality and of prompt action on presidential nominations.

N2  - We conducted an online survey (n = 3321) followed by five focus groups with Forest Service employees involved in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to explore agency views of how NEPA should be implemented within the agency. We filter these perceptions through the lenses of different functional groups within the agency, each with its own role in agency compliance with NEPA and its own suite of perceived accountabilities. In doing so, we uncover areas of consensus regarding valued practices as well as tensions between employees with different roles in NEPA compliance. General consensus exists regarding the importance of the effective functioning of interdisciplinary teams, but opinions about what constitutes an effective team vary. Findings suggest that NEPA serves as a playing field for competing accountabilities felt by line officers, disciplinary specialists, and advisory personnel within the agency, as each attempts to exert influence over NEPA processes and their outcomes.

N2  - The purpose of the research is to investigate the evolution of the royal right of patronage on the basis of the privileges of the Lavriv Basilian Monastery. The research methodology is based on analytical and synthetic critique of loyal privileges. A comparison of different editions of privileges, which were preserved in the confirmations of later times or were included in the majestic books of the Standing Committee of the Governor's Office in Lviv, was made. Preference is given to the use of accrued privileges in the city act books. The scientific novelty of the research is seen in the establishment of the legal influence of the royal administration on the activities of the Basilian monasteries. The Conclusions. The Polish administration tried to control the activities of the self-governing bodies of the Basilian Orden demanding that its Constitutions be in accordance with the religious legislation of the Commonwealth. Dining the 17th - 18th centuries, the royal right of patronage in the Basilian Older underwent a certain evolution: from the appointment of hegumens, archimandrites to the regulation of property security. Such changes were due to the desire of the Order to achieve full self-government. For this purpose, the Basilian monasteries were removed from the jurisdiction of the local bishops and handed over to the protoarchimandrite. Protohegumens received the right not only to represent, but also to appoint hegumens of monasteries. The royal administration retained a limited right to approve candidates for the positions of archimandrites, with the exception of the protoaarchimandrite, who was elected by the General Chapter of the Order: At this time there is a transition to the introduction of the election of senior administrative positions (protoarrhirnandrite, protohegumen, general and provincial consuls), while the middle (arrhimandrite) and lower (hegumen) rank of officials of the Order retained the ancient right to appoint as king (arrhimandrite), so on the part of the provincial administration (hegumens). The analyzed .system of the administrative system of the Order was based on a mixed form of government: the election and appointment of officials at different levels (local, provincial, general). However; the restriction of the administrative component in the royal law of patronage did not mean its complete elimination, because the next component - property regulation - continued to operate. Royal privileges transferred table land ownership to the use of monasteries located on their lands, and determined their economic rights cold freedoms.

N2  - In 2000, more than 60 nonprofit agencies, health care providers, government officials, and community advocates in Tarrant County, Texas, came together to work for systemic change in the mental health care system. The coalition, known as the Mental Health Connection, began working toward a "No Wrong Door" approach to mental health services, which required aggressive coordination between federal, private, and nonprofit resources. The result is a five- to six-year plan for implementation of a new systems of care model for children with severe emotional disturbances and their families. The Mental Health Connection also focuses on legislative advocacy to bring about necessary policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels. Finally, the coalition focuses on developing sustainable revenue streams that will allow the new systems to remain in place once the group accomplishes the initial mission of the Mental Health Connection.

N2  - In this paper I examine Dalit attitudes towards the state in Andhra Pradesh. In this part of India, Dalit lives and physical surroundings are quite literally shaped by the state and encounters with state officials in various guises are frequent. I argue that Dalits' dealings with the state have led them to a view which is essentially pragmatic: they see the state in terms of what they can extract from it. While their experiences with local bureaucracy are often frustrating and sometimes humiliating, they nevertheless regard the state as a resource which potentially can be tapped for their advance. Indeed, in light of the disintegration of patronage and heightened caste conflict, they are forced to turn to the state for assistance. The conflict between the two major Dalit castes themselves and between Dalits and the dominant castes over reservations also shows how central state resources are to Dalits' sense of identity. Contrary to much of the literature, then, I suggest that many of the most marginalised believe the state can assist their advance and demand that their political representatives harness state power to work in their interests. ©2011 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Previously unexamined written, visual, and performative channels of
communication between central government officials and local Buddhist
monks call for a.a wed understanding of sociopolitical connections
between the capital and the provinces of late Choson Korea (1392-1910).
Via a multidisciplinary approach, this article addresses the patronage
of three shrines dedicated to meritorious Buddhist monk-generals and
martyrs who fought during Japanese invasions (1592-98). Male and female
members of the central elite supported the construction of the shrines
in order to advance their respective political ambitions. Discontented
with court factionalism, the central elite wielded their support of the
shrines as a shaming device against their opponents and/or corrupt
officials, while Buddhist monks sought to gain social recognition and
enhance their respective monastery's political cache by maintaining the
shrines, and by performing Confucian commemoration rituals with royal
support.

N2  - Many scholars have chronicled the long political and legal battle that
led to ratification of the 16th Amendment on February 25, 1913. However,
none have described how the Bureau of Internal Revenue implemented the
tax in only six months on a shoestring budget. William H. Osborn, the
commissioner who oversaw the effort, left a diary of his experiences,
which sheds light on the political, budgetary, and bureaucratic
challenges he faced. While most internal revenue commissioners work in
relative obscurity, Osborn won public acclaim by pursuing long-neglected
evasions with headline grabbing criminal cases, pushing against
patronage to hire qualified agents, and instituting cost-saving
efficiencies. He melded political acumen, administrative genius, and a
talent for inspiring his employees to build the basic framework for
modern federal income tax collections. His experiences highlight the
important, but often overlooked, role played by skilled bureaucrats.

N2  - The G20 is an evolving international institution. Aided by both advances in information technology and support from home governments, a number of knowledge actors and networks seek to influence global economic governance with policy analysis and advice. This article assesses the international G20 think tank network called Think20 and the policy advocacy of private research institutes (such the Lowy Institute in Australia and the Centre for International Governance and Innovation in Canada) which are in the orbit of the G20 policy community. Think20 assists the global economic governance processes of the G20 by developing coordinative discourses' for policy development and implementation. Points for practitioners Ideas matter but ideas that imply major policy reform and innovation need to be made to matter if they are to direct government action. Networks provide one mechanism to broadcast and disseminate communicative discourses' to many different publics - local as well as global - and the infrastructure to crystalize and amplify coordinative discourses' underpinning the policy blueprints and reform proposals of governments that must motivate their own bureaucracies as well as collaborate with foreign government. This article discusses some of the network tools and practices for consensus building in transnational policy communities' that cultivate global policy coordination.

N2  - Issue addressed: The Western Australian (WA) Public Health Bill will replace the antiquated Health Act 1911. One of the proposed clauses of the Bill requires all WA local governments to develop a Public Health Plan. The Bill states that Public Health Plans should be based on evidence from all levels, including national and statewide priorities, community needs, local statistical evidence, and stakeholder data. Methods: This exploratory study, which targeted 533 WA local government officers, aimed to identify the sources of evidence used to generate the list of public health risks to be included in local government Public Health Plans. Results: The top four sources identified for informing local policy were: observation of the consequences of the risks in the local community (24.5%), statewide evidence (17.6%), local evidence (17.6%) and coverage in local media (16.2%). Conclusions: This study confirms that both hard and soft data are used to inform policy decisions at the local level. Therefore, the challenge that this study has highlighted is in the definition or constitution of evidence. So what? Evidence is critical to the process of sound policy development. This study highlights issues associated with what actually constitutes evidence in the policy development process at the local government level. With the exception of those who work in an extremely narrow field, it is difficult for local government officers, whose role includes policymaking, to read the vast amount of information that has been published in their area of expertise. For those who are committed to the notion of evidence-based policymaking, as advocated within the WA Public Health Bill, this presents a considerable challenge.

N2  - Objective: We aim to reflect on the introduction of risk-based approaches to public health, driven by legislation outlining the expected local government public health functions and roles by identifying factors that most influenced organisational change within the Western Australia local government sector when developing and submitting child and young people's health and social policy to an annual Awards program. Methods: This paper uses 10 years of data from a WA-based Local Government Policy Awards scheme to identify planned organisational change within the local government sector by applying a tangible organisational change model to develop a change narrative to describe factors that influenced local governments to address public health. Semi-structured interviews of 83 local government officers over the 10 years since implementation were used to create the narrative and identify factors that strengthened or hindered policy development and implementation at the local organisational level. Results: Participant interviews highlighted that the Policy Award Scheme contributed to steps outlined in the Pettigrew et al. (1992) stepped model of organisational change theory to support policy development. Implications for public health: Few studies have explored these elements in their own right. We argue that advocacy for structured policy development is continually needed to support and promote internal policy prioritisation and implementation in practice.

N2  - The use of scientific information in the policy-making process is prevalent in today's society, and political figures frequently consult scientists and experts when considering complex issues like climate change. While policy process literature concerning agenda setting and policy networks, such as epistemic communities and advocacy coalitions, considers the role of scientists in policymaking, very little work has provided insight into the relative influence and perceived relationships between scientists and policymakers. The ability of scientists and policymakers to work together has important implications for policy outcomes. We explore individual scientist's perceptions of the collective influence the scientific community has on policymaking, in addition to perceptions of relationships between scientists and policymakers. We suggest that a number of factors are relevant including trust, contact, attitudes, specialisation and demographics. Our findings indicate that, from scientists' perspectives, contact with policymakers, trust and attitudes about climate change play a significant role in shaping their relationship with policymakers.

N2  - On December 19, 1995, President William Jefferson Clinton signed the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) into law (2 U.S.C. §1601, et seq.). In his comments when signing the law, President Clinton identified a central question that continues to be an issue for lobbying laws: how can individual citizens’ rights be balanced against the desire to regulate and potentially control the access of special interests to government? As lobbying laws have been developed in the United States, the balance between the right of “ordinary Americans” to petition the government and the access that professional lobbyists can have to Members of Congress and executive branch decisionmakers has been at the forefront. The four major federal lobbying laws-the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) of 1938, the Regulation of Lobbying Act (RLA) of 1946, the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995, and the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA) of 2007-were enacted in response to changes in practice or perception surrounding lobbying. In most cases, the enactment, repeal, or amendment of lobbying laws was a response to multiple contextual changes that provided a policy window in which change was possible. This report provides a retrospective and prospective analysis of the LDA on its 20th anniversary, using research conducted and data collected by the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M capstone class over the 2014-2015 academic year. As the LDA turns 20, several issues, each already addressed to some extent in other statutes, have the potential to cause additional shifts in lobbying practices and perception. These include • Shadow lobbying-when an individual who is paid to engage public officials on behalf of clients does not register as a lobbyist. Shadow lobbying may raise questions about what practices and activities should trigger lobbyist registration requirements. • Grassroots lobbying-attempts to persuade government decisionmakers and influence policy outcomes by shifting public opinion and motivating citizens to take action, often by contacting Representatives and Senators. Grassroots lobbying is generally unregulated, although legislation has been introduced in the past that would require grassroots lobbying activities be registered and disclosed. • Revolving door-when federal employees leave the government for employment in the private sector or the government hires former private sector employees for government jobs. There are a number of post-employment restrictions that impose limits on federal employees moving to the private sector, or former lobbyists moving to the public sector. Analysis of whether current restrictions strike a suitable balance, are too restrictive, or too permissive, may be instructive. As these issues evolve, Congress has many options available to potentially amend existing lobbying laws. These include options to • change the definition of lobbying; • change disclosure thresholds for registered lobbyists; and • adjust resources available for implementation and enforcement. Additionally, Congress could choose not to amend existing lobbying laws and maintain current standards.

N2  - The article discusses the characteristic features of the party system in
Japan in 1955-1993, which give the grounds to describe its distinctive
nature as a dominant party model that was unique to the global
historical experience of democratic countries.
Special attention is paid to the unique toolkit used by the Liberal
Democratic Party to preserve its dominant positions in the Diet. An
emphasis is put on the electoral technologies, and, first of all, on the
personalistic orientation of Japanese voters, as well as on the lobbying
capabilities of influential LDP MPs, which provided them with
significant advantages in electoral mobilization. The
personality-oriented relationship with electors allowed the LDP to
recruit representatives of various social strata. The feedback
mechanisms of the ruling party with the society made it possible for the
LDP to effectively address increasingly complicated interests and values
of individual social groups and strata by means of a consolidated state
policy.
The ruling party created a powerful political planning apparatus and
maintained close ties with the bureaucracy. An important role in the
system of power of the LDP was played by the mechanisms of inner-party
democracy and the pluralism of opinions, ensuring a consensus within the
party ranks based on the interfactional balance of power.
The article gives several reasons for the end of the era of the ``1955
system{''}. First of all, due to the collapse of the USSR and the end of
the bipolarity era, the dividing line of ideological confrontation
between parties disappeared. Another reason was the fact that, by the
end of the 1980s, due to the change of the model of economic
development, it became impossible to finance numerous infrastructure
projects in depressed regions of Japan, resulting in substantially
decreased role of political authorities as the subject of redistribution
of surplus social product. Electoral psychology had also changed, and
the traditional methods of mobilizing votes used by the LDP had lost
their effectiveness. Finally, a certain role was played by mass
discontent with the ruling party, associated with the rapid expansion of
political corruption, in which the entirety of the LDP leadership was
involved.

N2  - Laws that restrict and disclose the actions of lobbyists are attempts to protect elected officials from undue influence and preserve public trust in lawmaking processes. Imposing too many campaign finance restrictions and reporting requirements on registered interest groups, however, might discourage them from registering. I use an original data set compiled from several decades of lobbyist lists to determine whether these laws suppress registration rates among interest groups. More limits on campaign finance activities, but not heavier reporting burdens, are shown to be associated with depressed registration of interest groups. As unregistered interests are not subject to these regulations, this presents a paradox of political reform. Reformers can either restrict the campaign finance activities of organized interests or disclose their lobbying activities more fully, but not both. I provide estimated totals of registered interest groups given a set of laws that maximizes compliance.

N2  - This chapter examines whether a shift in the orientation of farmers' groups in the Netherlands has occurred, from sector-specific interests to a focus on the defence of rural identity. Attention is also paid to the question of whether rural protest groups have evolved into political parties. The chapter distinguishes four types of rural protest group found in the Netherlands in the postwar period. The first are the anti-modernist farmers, known as the Free Farmers, who were dissatisfied with continuing government regulation of the agricultural sector and who strongly opposed agricultural modernisation policy. The second group were action-oriented farmers, who challenged the existing farmers' unions, arguing that the official organisations were too soft and too much involved with government. They aimed at strict production controls and higher agricultural prices. The third group, progressive farmers' coalitions, had deep concerns about the environmental consequences of agricultural practices and the impact of the CAP on farmers in less developed parts of the world. The fourth group consists of non-farmers' coalitions, including both rural and urban residents who wished to conserve those aspects of the countryside which represented their specific interests. Protests by these coalitions concerned issues such as biodiversity, national nature conservation areas, high-speed railways, wind farms and mega farms for intensive husbandry. The chapter concludes, firstly, that the clear shift in the orientation of rural protest groups from sector-specific interests to a focus on the defence of rural identity which took place in the UK, France and the USA is only partially reflected in the Netherlands. To a certain extent this can be explained by the fact that the Dutch rural space has always been close to urban centres; the rural has never been isolated. Secondly, the chapter also finds that the Free Farmers are the only group among the protest groups discussed that evolved into a political party: the Farmers' Party. The main reason for this was that their position was not represented by any of the existing political parties in parliament. Other protest groups, in particular the direct action-oriented farmers and the progressive farmers' coalitions, appeared to be more successful in achieving their aims through existing political parties.

N2  - The current experience of lobbying interests in Europe requires a detailed study of legislation to provide open public access to the Transparency Register and to promote the use of lobbying transparency mechanisms in European countries and EU institutions. These mechanisms ensure the implementation of relevant regulations and political decisions by political actors with the assistance of interest groups for the effective implementation of public policy. The purpose of the study is to establish the patterns of implementation of interest lobbying policy in Europe and assessing the reliability of lobbying activities in European countries and EU institutions to check the effectiveness of lobbying interests' modern experience in Europe and mechanisms in ensuring transparency and its integrity in the EU. Research methods: comparative analysis; regression analysis; systematization, generalization. Results. Availability has established the relationship between disclosure by lobbyists and oversight of compliance with the rules of the register and transparency in lobbying. Lobby transparency has been identified as too weak across Europe, as the implementation of the Transparency Register, which aims to regulate lobbying, has not protected against its excessive influence. The largest expenditure on EU lobbying for the period 2017-2018 falls on countries such as Belgium, Germany, and Italy. The current expenditure of EU member states is 91%, more than €2 billion. It was found that lobbying in Europe helps to solve current problems by further improving the legislation that will ensure the implementation of effective EU policy, where the main topics on the agenda are the implementation of the Law on Digital Services and overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been established that lobbying in Europe should address barriers to access to public sector information and public data faced by citizens, and require the implementation of measures to regulate the further activities of officials between the public sector and lobbying.

N2  - In 2003 the policy development process in Bosnia and Herzegovina was characterised by international community (IC) dominance. The IC provided the vast majority of the analysis of problems facing the country and drafted many of the laws. This article documents developments from fall 2003 to fall 2006 in the use of evidence and analysis in the policy development process and the role of local policy research organisations (PROs-often called think tanks) in it. The likely relation between these changes and the activities of a PRO mentoring project that operated over the same period is also assessed. Evidence comes as a series of interviews in both years with government officials and members of parliament, on the one hand, and leaders of PROs and advocacy NGOs on the other. The broad picture that emerges from the above review is of a substantial positive development in the policy development process in Bosnia and Herzegovina over the period. Factual evidence and analysis are playing a much greater role, and PROs have been a major provider of this information. The evidence indicates that PROs have been successful in convincing the policy community that they are purveyors of objective, disinterested advice and analysis. The improvements occurred in a conducive environment that steadily placed greater responsibility for policy formation on Bosnian officials. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Discussions on the appointment of woman as mufti in Malaysia are new and uncommon. In the history of the institutions of fatwa in Malaysia, woman has never been appointed as mufti, however there aren’t any, neither in the Islamic nor Malaysia laws prohibiting women from issuing fatwas and being a mufti. This study was aim at finding the views of Fatwa Members and Syariah Experts with regards to the appointment of female mufti in Malaysia. This study was of a qualitative type and utilizing focus group discussion’s method. It was found out that the focus group members enormously agreed to the point that it was possible for women to issue fatwas. However in reality, several issues should be first considered and solved before the appointment of woman as mufti could be realized. Thus, for the realization on the appointment of female mufti in Malaysia in the near future, a model of female mufti’s jurisdiction should be design and develop.

N2  - Private firms are of growing importance in virtually all transition economies but operate in market and institutional conditions that are still far from competitive and transparent. Although firms have at their disposal various alternative strategies for dealing with their problems, in this paper we focus on two: making unofficial payments to officials and joining business associations. Choices between these strategies may be affected by both firm and industry characteristics and institutional conditions. This paper has two objectives: (1) to compare the effects of two alternative strategies (unofficial payments and association memberships) on various alternative measures of firm performance; and (2) in the case of association membership, to determine which particular functions-lobbying, information, or other-have the greatest effects on several different measures of firm performance. To accomplish these objectives, we make use of the 2002 and 2005 waves of the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys in twentyeight transition economies. Estimates are obtained from both separate cross sections for 2002 and 2005 and a smaller panel of firms for which the information is available for both years. The estimates show that memberships in business associations, and especially access to their information functions, contribute more to firm performance than unofficial payments and lobbying, despite the fact that much of the literature asserts the opposite and assumes lobbying to be the primary function of business associations, especially in transition economies.

N2  - Bureaucracy is a much-maligned feature of contemporary government. And yet the aftermath of September 11 has opened the door to a reassessment of the role of a skilled civil service in the survival and viability of democratic society. Here, Ezra Suleiman offers a timely and powerful corrective to the widespread view that bureaucracy is the source of democracy's ills. This is a book as much about good governance as it is about bureaucratic organizations. Suleiman asks: Is democratic governance hindered without an effective instrument in the hands of the legitimately elected political leadership? Is a professional bureaucracy required for developing but not for maintaining a democratic state? Why has a reform movement arisen in recent years championing the gradual dismantling of bureaucracy, and what are the consequences? Suleiman undertakes a comparative analysis of the drive toward a civil service grounded in the New Public Management. He argues that "government reinvention" has limited bureaucracy's capacity to adequately serve the public good. All bureaucracies have been under political pressure in recent years to reduce not only their size but also their effectiveness, and all have experienced growing deprofessionalism and politicization. He compares the impact of this evolution in both democratic societies and societies struggling to consolidate democratic institutions. Dismantling Democratic States cautions that our failure to acknowledge the role of an effective bureaucracy in building and preserving democratic political systems threatens the survival of democracy itself.

N2  - Do authoritarian governments' responses towards different civil society organizations (CSOs) reflect policy differentiations? Building on the existing literature of graduated control, diversification of civil society, and consultative authoritarianism, this paper utilizes an online field experiment,(1) and interviews with government officials and CSO leaders to demonstrate that local governments have the tendencies to intentionally treat different CSOs with different policy responses, referred to as ``deliberate differentiation{''} in this paper. However, contrary to what the existing literature would suggest, this study reveals that at the local level, such differentiation is driven more by the state's interest in extracting productivity and outsourcing responsibility for the provision of public goods and less by the state's need to acquire information from CSOs, including politically sensitive advocacy groups.

N2  - Motivation Affirmative action policies have attracted significant academic and policy interest worldwide. One of the key criticisms of such policies is that they undermine meritocratic principles, but there is little evidence and analysis on how such policies are being implemented and shape meritocracy, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Purpose Drawing on a case study of an affirmative action policy designed for the inclusion of members from marginalized groups in Nepal's civil service, the article critically examines whether this erodes meritocracy and productivity. Methods and approach The article draws on empirical insights and data collected through a critical policy analysis, complemented by surveys and interviews with civil servants benefitted from affirmative action and other civil servants, including policy analysts and public intellectuals. Findings Our findings challenge a narrative that affirmative action in the form of reservations or quotas erodes meritocracy and reduces the quality of public services. Rather, we argue that an affirmative action policy can enrich meritocracy by addressing its inherent deficits, including its blindness to horizontal inequalities and forms of social exclusion, which tend to sustain the monopolization of bureaucracy by a dominant group in an already unequal society. Policy implications Reconceptualizing an affirmative action policy applied in Nepal's civil service as a tool of ``meritocratic inclusion,'' we argue that it rewards competence and promotes workforce diversity and social justice. Our evidence suggests that affirmative action, when it is carefully designed, can be an effective policy tool both to enhance representative bureaucracy and enrich meritocracy.

Our empirical study revealed Turkish judicial system, despite its push toward centralization and professionalization in the name of identification by the European impact, has a serious lack of translation and interpretation facilities, procedural incompleteness as the issue of bureaucracy in overloaded functions, and incompetency in migration-specific jurisdiction. We claim these shortcomings associating with manifestation of discrimination toward Syrians disallow to overcome the exclusionary mechanisms toward irregular migrants, except for some attorneys' professional efforts.

N2  - The American administrative state has become a cost-benefit state, at least in the sense that prevailing executive orders require agencies to proceed only if the benefits justify the costs. Some people celebrate this development; others abhor it. For defenders of the cost-benefit state, the antonym of their ideal is, alternately, regulation based on dogmas, intuitions, pure expressivism, political preferences, or interest-group power. Seen most sympathetically, the focus on costs and benefits is a neo-Benthamite effort to attend to the real-world consequences of regulations, and it casts a pragmatic, skeptical light on modern objections to the administrative state, invoking public-choice theory and the supposedly self-serving decisions of unelected bureaucrats. The focus on costs and benefits is also a valuable effort to go beyond coarse arguments, from both the right and the left, that tend to ask this unhelpful question: ``Which side are you on?'' In the future, however, there will be much better ways, which we might consider neo-Millian, to identify those consequences: 1) by relying less on speculative ex ante projections and more on actual evaluations; 2) by focusing directly on welfare and not relying on imperfect proxies; and 3) by attending closely to distributional considerations-on who is helped and who is hurt.

N2  - Communal violence against the minority communities of Ahmadiyah and Shi'a was on the rise during the government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (2004-14). This article discusses state responses to this violence. Previous studies commonly attributed communal violence in post-New Order Indonesia to the failure of local officials to stop the violence due to the security officials' kinship and local ties with the perpetrators. Some argue that the violence broke out due to, first, the role of local elites who provoked violence; and second, the role of local state officials who supported the mobilisation of the people by vigilante groups to stage the protests that led to violence. This article expands on these studies by arguing that the state complicity in violence stems from security officials' entangled relations with vigilante groups. These entangled relationships hampered the officers' ability to prevent incidents of religious violence before they occurred, and to bring charges against perpetrators afterward. The entanglement was the result of a blurred boundary where police officers and vigilante groups often ended up pursuing areas of mutual material and political interest. This study is based on seven months of PhD fieldwork in Ahmadiyah and Shi'a communities in West Java Province and East Java Province in 2013.

N2  - Migrant integration policies in the Netherlands have become increasingly restrictive over the past two decades. This development has been prompted chiefly by the strong politicization of the subject of integration and, as a consequence, a growing political interference with policymaking. Policy design and construction is predominantly carried out by policy officials in state bureaucracies. Some of these actors, however, have great difficulties with the restrictive turn in integration policies and the associated political discourse. Policy officials use the concept of professionalism to describe how they cope with the ambiguity between their personal convictions and the professional role they are expected to play. Thus, professionalism symbolizes cultural orientations, norms and values that are important in the bureaucratic organization. In this paper, we argue that the discourse of professionalism functions as a disciplinary logic that controls policy officials, but that simultaneously endows their work with meaning and creates a feeling of belonging.

N2  - Objective: To investigate managerial barriers and challenges facing East Azerbaijan Province health system. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in Tabriz, Iran, from August 2014 to August 2015, and comprised professionals, experts and informants working at the East Azerbaijan Health Centre. Data was collected through focus group discussions and semi-structured, face-to-face, individual and group interviews were conducted. Interviews and focus group discussions were taped, transcribed and analysed using content analysis method. Results: Of the 46 participants, 29(63%) were male and 17(37%) were female. Moreover, 15(33%) participants were head of their respective units and 8(17%) were district health managers. Managerial barriers witnessed during the study period differed between the three managerial levels of interest, i. e., district health centres, provincial health centre departments and top levels of provincial health centre and macro-management systems outside the health centre. Lack of management training, inadequate resources, unclear duties and responsibilities were considered to be the most common barriers facing district health centres. Unclear budgeting mechanisms, instability of management positions and shortage of trained staff on provincial and district levels were reported to be managerial barriers in provincial health centre departments. Political interference in technical decisions, treatment-based approaches, lack of clear career paths on all levels of health system management, unnecessary bureaucracy lying within inter-organisational relationships and ineffective employment legislation were identified as managerial barriers on top levels of the provincial health system and in macro-management systems independent of the health system. Conclusion: Diverse challenges influenced the performance of health managers.

N2  - Why has the internationally promoted Weberian-style bureaucracy failed to replace patronage as the dominant principle of state organization in post-war Kosovo? This article explores how international actors' rule-promotion activities and local actors' strategies of resistance play out and interact to explain the failure. The empirical analysis focuses on rules of recruitment in the civil service system in the period 2000-2016. The analysis juxtaposes two consecutive stages of the state-building process, which are marked by different degrees and forms of international involvement: the pre-independence period, 1999-2008; and post-independence period, 2008-2016. Evidence from the case suggests that during the pre-independence period, legal inconsistencies embedded in the internationally promulgated legislation enabled local actors' formal and informal strategies to recruit political cronies in the newly created civil service system. The transfer of authority from international administrators to elected local authorities, especially after Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008, did not solve the problem of legal inconsistencies, and instead, served to consolidate governing parties'strategies of control over recruitment in the state bureaucracy. More often than not, patron-client relationships that thrive at the borderline between formality and informality of political behaviour, continued to undermine external rule transfers.

N2  - Drawing on accounts of regulatory capture in which an industry's influence activities pull regulation in its direction, apart from incentives or information, this article develops a formal model of capture as a shift in a policy-making agent's preferences, due to costly actions by the industry. One type of action is rentseeking that produces only capture, whereas the other type also improves regulatory quality by producing information that reduces policy uncertainty. The model shows how the ability to capture the agent can incentivise the interest group to produce more information. Thus, aligning an agent's preferences with a political principal's and immunising him from capture is not generally optimal; instead, the principal prefers an agent who is susceptible to capture associated with quality improvements but also initially more opposed to the group than the principal. A comparison of two Securities and Exchange Commission rulemakings illustrates the logic of the model.

N2  - While there is broad consensus that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) sometimes succeed in influencing policy making within international organizations (IOs), there is much less agreement on the factors that make NGO lobbying effective. This article makes two contributions to this debate. First, the determinants of influence among NGOs active in different IOs, issue areas and policy phases are examined. The analysis builds on original survey data of more than 400 NGOs involved in five different IOs, complemented by elite interviews with IO and state officials. Secondly, the article advances a specific argument about how the strategic exchange of information and access between NGOs and IOs increases NGO influence in IOs. This argument, derived from theories of lobbying in American and European politics, is contrasted with three alternative explanations of NGO influence, privileging material resources, transnational networks and public opinion mobilization, and the broader implications of these results for research on NGOs in global governance are explored.

N2  - Background: Namibia is typical of low-income and middle-income countries with growing tobacco use, but with limited capacity to impose comprehensive tobacco control legislation. Despite initiating dialogue on national tobacco control policy in 1991, the country took nearly 20 years to pass the Tobacco Products Control Act. Objective: To use Namibia as a case study to illustrate challenges faced by low-income countries working to forward tobacco control legislation.Method: Face-to-face and telephonic interviews were conducted with 13 bureaucrats and advocates currently or previously engaged in tobacco-related work in Namibia. Tobacco-related news articles from national newspapers were examined. Results: The constitutional obligation of the government to promote public health laid the foundation for Namibia’s tobacco control policy. Staff capacity constraints greatly delayed the passing of tobacco control legislation. It is unclear what influence the tobacco industry’s involvement as a stakeholder had on policy; however, in at least one instance, the tobacco industry actively misled government. Namibia’s ratification of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was instrumental in passing legislation that meets most provisions of the international treaty. The media have generally played a supportive role in pushing the government to pass tobacco control legislation. Conclusions: The fact that Namibia was able to pass fairly comprehensive tobacco control legislation with such meagre resources is commendable. The government must now implement the regulations that make the legislation effective. Tobacco control progress in low-income and middle-income nations can be encouraged through use of the media and improved staff and legal capacity within health ministries.

N2  - Objective: This case series describes tobacco industry tactics and strategies used to interfere, derail, delay, and weaken the development of effective health warning regulations in Malaysia, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Methods: A historical review of official reports, news articles, and gray literature was undertaken to identify tobacco industry tactics and strategies to hamper government efforts in implementing stronger pictorial health warning regulations in four Asian jurisdictions (Cambodia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and the Philippines). Results: Nineteen countries/jurisdictions in the WHO Western Pacific region currently require pictorial health warnings on cigarette packs, including some of the world's largest, in line with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Article 11 Guidelines. In the four jurisdictions examined, tobacco industry interference consisted of lobbying and misinformation of high-level government officers and policy-makers, distributing industry-friendly legislative drafts, taking government to court, challenging government timelines for law implementation, and mobilizing third parties. Strong political leadership and strategic advocacy enabled governments to successfully overcome this industry interference. Conclusion: The tobacco industry uses similar tactics in different jurisdictions to derail, delay, and weaken the implementation of effective health warning policies. Identifying and learning from international experiences can help anticipate and defeat such challenges.

N2  - While public colleges and universities have a long history of engaging
in the political process, relatively little is known about their
activities. This study attempts to examine, both theoretically and
empirically, the relationship between state economic, demographic,
political, and policy contexts and state public higher education
interest group density. This study applied a conceptual framework which
borrowed heavily from the Energy-Stability-Area Model of state interest
group systems and recent thinking regarding state higher education
interest group systems. The empirical results provided general support
for each aspect of the conceptual framework.

N2  - This article argues that weak local governments increase levels of taxation by ``borrowing{''} institutional capacity from certain types of businesses. While many businesses lobby against taxation, businesses that are locally owned, nationally connected, and logistically complex build robust associations that support taxation. These types of businesses benefit from improvements in public infrastructure, so they empower their associations to monitor members' tax compliance and to pressure officials to uphold their spending commitments. The article demonstrates the necessity of business support for taxation in the absence of state capacity by comparing two Philippine cities that differ in their ability to tax despite a number of similarities between them. The case studies show that tax increases co-varied with business support, and that business support waxed and waned depending on over-time variation in the capability of business associations to discourage tax evasion and to enforce official commitments to spend on infrastructure.

N2  - This paper examines the reasons for the early dominance of the bureaucratic élite in Pakistan and the downsizing that was brought about by the administrative reforms of 1973. The perceptions of bureaucrats and ministers indicate that loyalty to political establishment is now regarded a crucial requirement in a bureaucrat. This shift from the principle of political neutrality to the practice of political allegiance has affected both the development agenda as well as the institutions of the country.

N2  - This contribution explores the strategies used by popular movements seeking to advance social reforms, and the challenges once they succeed. It analyzes how a strategic alliance between the Brazilian Landless Workers Movement (MST) and the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG) transformed the Ministry of Education's official approach to rural schooling. This success illustrates the critical role of international allies, political openings, framing, coalitions and state–society alliances in national policy reforms. The paper also shows that once movements succeed in advancing social reforms, bureaucratic tendencies such as internal hierarchy, rapid expansion and ‘best practices’ – in addition to the constant threat of cooptation – can prevent their implementation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - The Landless Workers' Movement (MST) has been the principal protagonist developing an alternative educational proposal for rural public schools in Brazil. This article analyzes the MST's differential success implementing this proposal in municipal and state public schools. The process is both participatoryactivists working with government officials to implement MST goalsand contentiousthe movement mobilizing support for its education initiatives through various forms of protest. In some locations, the MST has succeeded in institutionalizing a participatory relationship with government actors, while in other regions the MST has a more limited presence in the schools or has been completely banned from participating. Drawing on the concept of coproductionthe active participation of civil society actors in the provision of public goodsthe author argues that coproduction is a joint product of high levels of social mobilization and government orientation. The former is necessary in all cases, while the latter can take the form of either a left-leaning or clientelistic government.

N2  - This article discusses the topical problem of cooperation in the separation of powers between the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and the President of the Russian Federation, the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, the Government of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court. The author suggests improving the regulation of cooperation of the Constitutional Court and the head of the state, the legislative, executive and judicial branches taking into consideration its status. On the basis of the constitutional legislation and law enforcement practice the author concludes that the leading role in cooperation of the President of the Russian Federation and the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation belongs to the head of the state, who influences the composition of the Constitutional Court and the appointment of its heads, assignment of additional social guarantees of judicial independence, execution of rendered judgments. The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation has an opposite influence on the activities of the President of the Russian Federation in the execution of expert advisory, constituent, statutory and regulatory functions giving expert opinions over complicated constitutional matters, certification of the act of oath of the newly elected head of the state, participation in the procedure of impeachment of the President of the Russian Federation, judgments of other categories, referring the competence of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation. Analyzing relations between the Constitutional Court and the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, it can be noted that it can actively assist in the elaboration of the legislative activities of the Russian parliament by means of realization of the right to legislative initiative, submission of messages and summarized judicial practice, legal background of its judgments and positions which contain suggestions and recommendations necessary for the consideration of new laws. The Federation Council can also influence the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation in a similar way, when it takes part in the appointment and juration of judges, early termination of their powers and holding joint representative, scientific and international meetings. Considering the features of the relations of the Constitutional Court and the Government of the Russian Federation, it is necessary to note the circumstantial character of these relations. It is worked out in the participation in trials, carrying out legal monitoring and exchange of information over the status of rendered judgments of the Constitutional Court in law enforcement practice, which are legal grounds for improving the law-making of the federal executive authorities. The form of relations between the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation is described separately. It assumes making suggestions on personal staff of judges of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation to the President of the Russian Federation. Besides, cooperation of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court implies a wide participation of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation in hearing cases during constitutional justice administration by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation. Other aspects of this cooperation are rendering acts on the official explanation of issues of the order of the Constitutional Court judgment execution by the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which have a decisive meaning for general jurisdiction and arbitral jurisdiction courts. A prospective direction of the cooperation of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation is the obligation to invite the Chairman of the Constitutional Court and its representatives to the sessions of the Plenum of the Supreme Court over the issues of explanation of the order of application of laws according to the legal positions of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation. The author supports the suggestion over the reasonability of creation of a special legal expert or a State Council of Justice as a coordinating and consulting authority from heads of superior judicial institutions to carry out a single judicial policy in the judicial system of the Russian Federation.

N2  - This contribution builds on the insights provided by the literature on sub-national mobilization in the European Union (EU) to assess whether the 2004-2007 rounds of enlargement have changed anything in this respect. Empirical analysis uses two types of data sources. The first is a survey of over a 100 regional offices in Brussels, and the second consists of 29 semi-structured interviews with Commission officials led in the aftermath of the 2004-2007 enlargements. These data are used to answer the following two research questions: (1) is there a 'new' versus 'old' cleavage at the territorial level in Brussels? (2) Is there anything like an 'enlargement effect' on sub-national mobilization? Analysis reveals that, while there is fading evidence of a 'new' versus 'old' cleavage in Brussels, enlargement has nevertheless had an impact on sub-national mobilization at the EU level, reinforcing older but also newer trends.

N2  - This article seeks to identify which factors lead local governments to use corporate public sector organizations, particularly municipal corporations, for service delivery. The authors argue that local officials trade off bureaucratic costs of in-house production with agency costs of external delegation to municipal corporations when deciding how to deliver local public services. Econometric models are employed to test this explanation for the adoption of municipal corporations by 278 Portuguese local governments. The results indicate that organizational size, financial independency and fiscal surplus, as well as ideological concerns and the activity of local interest groups, drive choices of local governance structures.

N2  - While medical identification and treatment of gender dysphoria have existed for decades, the development of transgender as a "collective political identity" is a recent construct. Over the past twenty-five years, the transgender movement has gained statutory nondiscrimination protections at the state and local levels, hate crimes protections in a number of states, inclusion in a federal law against hate crimes, legal victories in the courts, and increasingly favorable policies in bureaucracies at all levels. It has achieved these victories despite the relatively small number of trans people and despite the widespread discrimination, poverty, and violence experienced by many in the transgender community. This is a remarkable achievement in a political system where public policy often favors those with important resources that the transgender community lacks: access, money, and voters. The Remarkable Rise of Transgender Rights explains the growth of the transgender rights movement despite its marginalized status within the current political opportunity structure.

N2  - The women, peace, and security agenda is contested ground for activists, academics, and practitioners. With the issue of women and conflict the locus of tension between feminists, bureaucrats, military actors, and government officials, assessing WPS advocacy provokes a series of questions. Whose goals count in advocacy on women, peace, and security, and what counts as success when these goals are deeply contested? Drawing on the advocacy efforts of the NGO Working Group on WPS at the UN Security Council, this chapter looks to answer these questions. It examines the capacity of advocacy to effect change via multilateral institutions, including the UN Security Council. Ultimately the effectiveness of these tools hinges not just upon the creative and strategic design of policy frameworks, but upon the political will in the UNSC to utilize them. As such, any advocacy approach that seeks to move accountability forward in the Council needs to be resilient to the political ebbs and flows within the Council. © Oxford University Press 2019.

N2  - Every occupation the menibers of which succeed in gaining a fair measure of autonomy from its environment is on its way towards professionalization. According to this view, the process is a matter of changing the relationship between occupation and environment, and especially - autonomy being at stake - the power/dependency aspect of this relationship (Mok, 1973). Many tools can be used to widen the sphere of autonomy for the occupational group, but it is on the other hand not to be expected that the ‘environment’ will react passively to these occupational endeavours. Accordingly, it is of great importance to know whether the occupational members, striving after autonomy, offer their services collectively or not. In other words, whether they perform their services as an organized group or not. When using the concept of ‘profession’ one usually thinks of certain occupations the members of which act and work individually, or at the most in rather small and egalitarian groups (e.g. physicians and lawyers). Military officers on the other hand clearly belong to another professional category. For it is evident that their occupational services are rendered collectively, by the hierarchically organized armed forces as a whole. Strikingly, in the case of the armed forces, a fusion of profession and organization, of professional and managerial groups, has been effected, quite unknown to other professional occupations (van Doom, 1965). Second, it is of equal importance to know whether the ‘environment’ has been organized to resist the autonomy claims of the professional occupation. Usually no organized bodies of patients and clients have emerged to face physicians and lawyers, leaving these ‘consumers’ without an organizational weapon to defend their interests. Strikingly, again in the case of the military profession, it is opposed not to splintered interest groups but to an organized body. This is the state. The state sees the military occupation in need of checks and balances, and wants to keep the military subservient to itself (Teitler, 1974).

N2  - Administrative elites in Spain constitute a genuine political force which has survived regime changes. Senior civil servants use both their wide range of skills and their family networks to control administrative and political life. This is why the democratic transition after 1975 left the structure of the administrative elite structures intact. The administrative elite has provided the main recruiting ground for political staff during the various governments of the democratic era. In addition, high-level positions are heavily politicised, a situation which has persisted under both socialist and right-wing governments. There is a similar politicisation of the civil service of the autonomous communities. There has never been any separation between administrative and political elites in Spain, and this has jeopardised attempts to reform public management.

N2  - The Spanish bureaucracy suffers from a lack of deep historic roots. It has been nothing more than a continuous effort to recreate ex nihilo a homogeneous public service at the European level. The Spanish tradition of instability, of permanent conflict between political factions, of the selling of public jobs and, finally, our typical ‘spoils system’, were not the best foundations for the establishment of a professional modern civil service. On the other hand, the public employees affected by the spoils system were always a group interested in the fall of the government, which had been the cause of their spoil retirement, and this situation certainly did not contribute to political stability. Favouritism and patronage were the principal means of recruiting and organising the civil service and political class. In these circumstances of instability and protectionism, some civil servants monopolised the exercise of the authority of the state, including fundamental public tasks such as the budget, tax policy or public works. This situation of monopoly was intimately connected with the knowledge and experience that only these public officials had, which enabled them to enjoy stability against the instability of the other public officials and also to achieve an ius singulare as a legal base of their situation. This circumstance made it possible for certain groups of public officials, due to their professional competence, their political affiliations, the importance of their functions and their group solidarity, to create special corps, from which some became powerful members of the political class, crystallising into an elite structure which has remained until now.

N2  - To counter negative publicity about the tobacco industry, Philip Morris has widely publicized its philanthropy initiatives. Although corporate philanthropy is primarily a public relations tool, contributions may be viewed as offsetting the harms caused by corporate products and practices. That such donations themselves have harmful consequences has been little considered. Drawing on internal company documents, we explored the philanthropy undertaken as part of Philip Morris's PM21 image makeover. Philip Morris explicitly linked philanthropy to government affairs and used contributions as a lobbyingtool against public health policies. Through advertising, covertly solicited media coverage, and contributions to legislators' pet causes, Philip Morris improved its image among key voter constituencies, influenced public officials, and divided the public health field as grantees were converted to stakeholders.

N2  - This study critically discusses the practices and challenges of converting the former Eritrean fighters into civil servants and their management afterwards. The study finds that, although both categories of the Eritrean civil servants (ex and non-ex-fighters) have been working together since independence, ex-fighter civil servants were given special privileges in a number of human resource management (HRM) practices, such as recruitment and selection, placement, promotion, training and compensation. That is, the political involvement in the management of the ex-fighter civil servants was considerable, which in turn has led to a certain degree of politicisation in the civil service. The Eritrean experience draws a number of lessons with regard to process, treatment within the workplace and different perceptions on the part of the two categories of civil servant.

N2  - This paper studies the impact of bicameralism on the level of corruption of elected officials. The relationship between parliamentary organization and corruption is analyzed in a two-period game between legislators, citizens and a lobby group, which delivers several predictions that we empirically investigate using a panel of 35 democracies during the period 1996-2004. Assuming that legislators choose a multidimensional policy on which citizens and a lobby group have opposing interests, we show that bicameralism improves the accountability of legislators to the electorate when the same party controls the two chambers and party polarization is high, while the opposite holds if the two chambers are controlled by different parties. These predictions find strong support in our empirical analysis.

N2  - This essay investigates two bitter antagonists in the turbulent politics of contemporary Thailand: the People’s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), with its members labeled the “Yellow Shirts,” and the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), or the “Red Shirts.” Each of the two foes, typically regarded only as a social movement, actually has a vast network connecting supporters from many quarters. The Yellow Shirt network is associated with the monarchy, military, judiciary, and bureaucracy. The Red Shirt network, organizationally manifest in a series of electorally triumphant parties, is linked to exiled ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, his “proxies,” and groups and individuals who opposed the military coup that ousted Thaksin in 2006. The significance of the two antagonistic networks can be gauged from their different influences on democratic processes over several years. Using concepts of political networks to examine the PAD and UDD within the socio-political context in which they arose, the essay focuses on several aspects of the networks: their political conception and perspectives, their organizational structures (for decision making and networking), and the strategies and activities of their members. The essay critically analyzes key and affiliated characters within the PAD and UDD, as well as the functional mechanisms of the networks, in order to evaluate the positions of the two networks in contemporary Thai politics. © Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University.

N2  - In 2002 Nepal's parliament passed a liberal abortion low, after nearly three decodes of reform efforts. This paper reviews the history of the movement for reform and the combination of factors that contributed to its success. These include sustained advocacy for reform; the dissemination of knowledge, information and evidence; adoption of the reform agenda by the public sector and its leadership in involving other stakeholders; the existence of work for safe motherhood as the context in which the initiative could gain support; an active women's rights movement and support from international and multilateral organisations; sustained involvement of local NGOs, civil society and professional organisations; the involvement of journalists and the media; the absence of significant opposition; courageous government officials and an enabling democratic political system. The overriding rationale for reforming the abortion low in Nepal has been to ensure safe motherhood and women's rights. The first government abortion services officially began in March 2004 at the Maternity Hospital in Kathmandu; services will be expanded gradually to other public and private hospitals and private clinics in the coming years. &COPY; 2004 Reproductive Health Matters.

N2  - The drive to 'root out' corruption has become a predominant feature of the 'save Africa' discourse currently enjoying a high level of exposure in international debate. This article begins by stressing the importance of the conventional distinction between 'grand' and 'petty' corruption, not least because each solicits rather different policies of containment. Focusing upon petty corruption it is argued that current efforts at containment are still strongly influenced by the Weberian concept of rational-legal bureaucracy (RLB) and that a configuration close to RLB continues to be widely regarded as the necessary and likely destination of administrative reform. This despite the fact that there does not seem to be a clear view as to the distinctive components of this 'bureaucracy'. In particular the discourse of development administration tends not to take account of the significance for bureaucracies of informal networks. Accordingly, this article moves on to examine the inter-relationship between formal and informal manifestations focusing particularly upon the politicisation of 'bureaucratic' relations. Given the apparently high levels of politicisation of the administrative apparatus in sub-Saharan Africa, what are the prospects for its reform and ultimately the containment of petty corruption?

N2  - In the European Union (EU), rights advocacy NGOs increasingly seek to influence supranational policy making. The success of immigration and asylum NGOs in inserting themselves into policy making depends on existing (in)formal ties to EU institutions. In contrast, human rights-based NGOs received institutional support through the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) containing a civil society platform that aggregates NGO claims. This article applies a comparative framework derived from the literature on transnational advocacy, using the distinction between venues and frames as starting points for analysis. It compares both sets of NGOs, exploring issues of institutional access and agenda-setting, and examines the strategies and objectives of advocacy NGOs in these two different political settings: while immigration and asylum advocates rely mainly on pluralistic lobbying strategies and pre-given, exogenous institutional opportunity structures, Fundamental Rights Platform NGOs engage in a novel approach in which civil society actors endogenously co-constitute aspects of participatory governance in the EU. On the basis of interviews with NGOs and EU officials, we conclude that each of these strategies exhibit specific trade-offs based on the nature of the relationship to the EU institutions. It is argued that each type of access has its idiosyncratic drawback: while immigration and asylum advocacy may result in dispersed opportunities to steer outcomes at the EU level, the inclusion of rights-based NGOs in the FRA limits their strategic repertoire. Finally, issue-specificity also conditions agenda-setting as higher issue convergence enables more focused framing, while a diffuse issue spectrum yields weaker frames and authority. .

N2  - Do bipartisan contributions by corporations and trade associations reflect strategic considerations or ideological moderation? In this article, I leverage lobbying disclosures in Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin to provide a new measure of ideology that allows me to adjudicate between the two accounts. These states’ legislatures permit or require lobbyists to declare their principals’ positions on lobbied bills. I combine these data with roll call votes to estimate the ideal points of legislators and private interests in the same ideological space. I find that the revealed preferences of most corporations and trade groups are more conservative than what would be implied by their contribution behavior. This shows that a moderate contribution record need not imply moderation in policy preferences. Thus, such interests may not reduce polarization overall. Further, the divergence between contribution and position-taking behavior indicates that many business interests employ sophisticated strategies to influence public officials whom they disagree with.

N2  - The H-2A temporary agricultural guest worker program has become the
primary source of labor to harvest citrus. An estimated 80\% of the
2016-17 citrus crop was harvested by H-2A workers. This paper outlines
an ongoing project to interview and summarize the economic and political
perspectives of competing interest groups regarding H-2A and temporary
guest worker programs in general. Three interest groups are targeted to
solicit opinions about the H-2A program administration and how well the
economic interests of growers, domestic workers, and foreign workers are
being met. The groups surveyed are agricultural employers, including
growers and farm labor contractors, worker advocates, and government
officials charged with overseeing the H-2A program. Results of the
survey provide insights into how the existing program could or should be
modified as part of a comprehensive immigration reform package.

N2  - The article presents observations from a 2006 township election experiment in Ya'an Municipality, Sichuan Province. Gradual institutionalization of elections to Chinese village committees has for two decades fascinated those interested in social and political development in rural China. Elections at the next level-the townships-were seen by many, in China and outside, as a natural next step. For this reason, the election of a township mayor in Buyun in 1998 attracted considerable attention, but the official reaction was negative. The elections in Ya'an juxtaposed against this background are of considerable interest as they can be seen as a way of testing the direction and limits of future reforms. The Ya'an elections were not only for the mayor, but also for the entire township leadership, including the township Party secretary. However, the final selection was-as previously-made at higher politico-administrative levels with the voting results serving as just one input to the decision-making process. For this reason, these elections should be termed "consultative, " and we suggest that such consultative elections can become an important tool in the party-state's cadre management.

N2  - Recently, many scholars in public administration have argued for a participatory turn: the introduction of deliberative arrangements to include citizens in policymaking. In this article, the arguments and likely consequences of these proposals are assessed by using Max Weber’s classical analysis of the interplay between democracy and bureaucratization. It is argued that advocacy for a participatory turn contains blind spots. In consequence, the proposed measures are likely to increase the problems that they were intended to remedy. Points for practitioners: The conclusion for practitioners is that direct participatory arrangements are not the panacea to the multiple problems they are often presented to be. The view through a Weberian lens urges caution on those who consider introducing such arrangements, as they might lead to a diminishing of predictability and accountability of public administration, a decrease in (substantial) expertise within government, and a general dissatisfaction with arrangements that do not provide citizens with what they were led to expect. More direct participation, then, easily contributes to the problems they were meant to remedy. © The Author(s) 2015.

N2  - This article examines the career of the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) as a policy instrument. Looking at the European Employment Strategy and the Lisbon Agenda, it shows that more has been accomplished than is often realised. It argues that the OMC's apparent fragility reflects an intrinsic tension, termed here the 'soft-law dilemma': it must ensure a constant supply of items to feed the EU agenda, whilst at the same time guaranteeing a level of institutional stability sufficient to allow effective policy delivery. To maintain both legitimacy and effectiveness, the OMC has learned to navigate between the extremes of all-out policy activism and bureaucratisation. As a result, the OMC has become an established form of socio-economic governance at EU level. A decade later, EU actors have the resources to take action in areas long associated with national sovereignty, thereby widening the scope and potential for a politicisation of the EU. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - From a political economy perspective, politicians often fail to implement structural reforms. In this contribution we investigate if the resistance to reform is based on the differences in the risk preferences of voters, politicians, and bureaucrats. Based on three surveys among the German electorate, 175 members of the Federal German Parliament and 106 officials from German ministries, this is not the case. Since both politicians and bureaucrats have a higher risk appetite than the voters, their risk preferences cannot be seen as an explanation for the resistance to structural reform. Hence, it must be caused by other reasons. These could be interventions by veto players, wars of attrition by powerful interest groups, or reform logjams initiated. However, as during times of populist campaigns, the election process can put forth candidates with very high risk appetites, the constitutions of democracies turn out to be rather effective if hazardous actions and measures by political rookies and gamblers are inhibited by checks and balances.

N2  - This chapter explores the continuing challenge of holding to account an institution, the proposed Public Service Ombudsman (PSO), which is itself a mechanism of accountability, while ensuring its independence is not impaired. The model of Officers of Parliament, as developed in the UK and New Zealand, is used as the template for an examination of the provisions in the draft Public Service Ombudsman Bill. While these provisions draw heavily on the first official to be considered an Officer of Parliament, the Comptroller and Auditor General, there are variations relating to the arrangements for appointment and corporate governance. As well as suggesting specific changes to the draft legislative provisions, the conclusions recommend a wider debate on both (a) Officers of Parliament as a distinct unit of our constitutional watchdogs and (b) best practice in corporate governance in the ombudsman sector.

N2  - Medicaid is vastly more important than Medicare or private insurance in funding long-termcare (LTC). However, states vary tremendously in their commitment to Medicaid LTC. This article advances knowledge of the origins, nature, and implications of this variation. After examining the degree of variation in state spending on Medicaid LTC, we show how federal policy has over the past fifty years steadily increased state discretion to shape these services. This decentralization largely reflects the potency of the intergovernmental lobby-governors and other state officials-in influencing federal policy. While fueling state variation, the intergovernmental lobby has also provided valuable political support that has helpedMedicaid growand resist retrenchment. After considering policy options that could mitigate Medicaid LTC inequities rooted in state differences, we assess how the catalytic forces that have fueled growth in Medicaid LTC may be insufficient to protect the program from future erosion.

N2  - This article analyzes the influence of the media on the central Norwegian immigration administration. Through behind-the-scenes ethnographic methods, it explores how key bureaucratic values such as impartiality, neutrality and loyalty are challenged and modified by the impact of the news media. A key question is to what extent this process of mediatization overlaps with a more general trend of politicization of the civil service. The article first documents that media pressure generates comprehensive strategies aimed at servicing the press, but also different types of information control and internal steering. Second, it describes how media management has become an important concern within public administration, which identifies strongly with the bureaucratic system and its values, and protects and defends it in the media. The article introduces the term 'administrative loyalty' to describe these practices and standards that go beyond the imperative to loyally serve the media-related needs of political superiors.

N2  - There is no doubt whatsoever that sheep farming will have a part to play in the UK farming scene for a very long time into the future for it is supported by some of the most dedicated and entrepreneurial people in agriculture. They are blessed with the indomitable spirit and determination needed to ensure a real future for sheep in spite of the difficulties and impediments put in place by urban orientated politicians and civil servants and in spite of the highly professional lobbying of bodies of people who are dedicated to hold sway without understanding the problems which they create for farming. This is especially so when that involves extensive livestock keeping. Examples abound with a great deal of new legislation having a serious impact on the way in which the industry has to operate in order to survive. Included in this is the ability which the general public now has to access farmland whether it is in sole occupation or else common land. Both are problematic and create difficulties for farmers usually through ignorance, when dogs are allowed to roam amongst stock without proper control. In addition to the daily needs of shepherding and running a farm there is the ever growing burden of paperwork which is not only alien to the practical approach of hands-on farmers and largely seen by them as unnecessary and tiresome, but which encroaches on lives which are already short of breathing space and so-called quality time to think and plan for the future. The ban on foxhunting will cause particular problems for sheep farming simply because hunting the fox, a particularly vicious predator of young lambs can only be done with a pack of hounds of adequate size, so that the fox, a wily animal, can be followed and disposed of in a sensible way. The Act allowing only two hounds in a wooded area is totally inadequate. Copyright © 2005 Royal Agricultural Society of England All rights reserved.

N2  - African states have been in a state of transition since gaining independence from their colonial powers since the 1960s. Some of them commenced their independence with a little more experience in governing than others. However, they all inherited the governing culture of their former colonial powers with limited prior experience in the relationship between government and administration that is required to obtain an efficient and effective public sector. Since independence, each country had to craft its own system of “democracy” but often succeeded only in establishing a semblance of democracy. The newly created democracies were characterized by volatility in communities endeavouring to maintain their identities and appointed officials failing to implement policies due to political involvement/interference. This chapter attends to the political/administrative interface as a debilitating factor in constitutional efforts to provide a stable state with the capacity to satisfy societal needs. Public sector institutions are characterised by the need for cooperation by two sets of role players. On the one side the elected political office bearers determine policy, set priorities according to their convictions and have to satisfy the electorate that their needs are being addressed. The other set of role players in the policy domain consists of appointed officials who have to give effect to policy (which may only contain vague guidelines) and ensure that the correct procedures are followed, that expenditure can be accounted for and that the promised services are delivered effectively and efficiently as viewed from society’s perspective. This results in an interface between politics and administration. However, there is no clearly delineated dividing line between the two functions, making the identification of the respective contributions by the two sets of participants complicated. The two functions may even be considered as complementary. This chapter discusses the interface from an African local government perspective. It is argued that the interface is diffused as a result of political involvement and interference of politicians in managerial matters, e.g. through the utilization of deployees (appointments based on political affiliation) or through the interference of higher levels of government in municipal matters. The arguments concerning the topic mainly use published and electronic sources. .

N2  - Widespread scandal and public opinion helped to fuel Senator Barack Obama’s nonstop attack on the role of lobbyists in American politics, starting as the Democrat’s ethics and lobbying reform leader in the US Senate in 2006, continuing in his 2008 election campaign, and repeated in 2009 and 2010 with his sustained attempts as president to change the culture of lobbying and influence in Washington. Lobbying is a profession that has been deeply sullied in the last five years by the illegal actions and conviction of Jack Abramoff, the criminal convictions of Representatives “Duke” Cunningham (bribes for earmarks) and Bob Ney (accepting illegal gifts from lobbyists), the resignation and conviction of Representative Tom DeLay (illegal use of corporate campaign funds from lobbyists), the conviction (later overturned) of Senator Ted Stevens (illegal gifts from lobbyists), as well as the criminal conviction of 21 lobbyists, former congressional aides, and executive branch officials (illegal gifts to members of Congress). More recently in 2009 and 2010, Congressman Charles Rangel (DNY) was asked to step down as chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, and after a lengthy investigation and trial before the House Ethics Committee, he was convicted on 11 counts related to breaking House Ethics gift ban and travel rules associated with lobbyists. In 2009, the House Ethics Committee investigated Representatives Todd Tiahrt (R-KS), Peter Visclosky (D-ID), John Murtha (D-PA), Norm Dicks (D-WA), and Jim Moran (D-VA), all on the House Appropriations Committee, for the reciprocal exchange of campaign contributions for earmarks from corporations through PMA, a now defunct lobbying firm owed by a former House Appropriations subcommittee committee staff director.

N2  - The development of Thailand’s bureaucracy began from the time of the old old Kingdom of Sukhothai (late 13th century). The bureaucracy was formally organized on the premise that it existed to serve the King. The staff was comprised of close relatives of the King and commoners who rose to high—ranking posts on their own merits or through the King’s personal patronage. Thai bureaucracy continued relatively unchanged until the second half of the 19th century. Threats from colonial powers forced first King Mongkut and then his son King Chulalongkorn (1868–1910) to make major changes to strengthen internal unity in order to face this external challenge.

Symposium on the Cost and Value of New Medicines in an Era of Change,
TUFTS UNIV, TALLOIRES, FRANCE, JUL 25-27, 2001
N2  - It is widely recognised that the Japanese healthcare system has been ranked as one of the best in the world because of its excellent efficiency and equity. The longevity and low infant mortality of the Japanese population have been achieved with a relatively low ratio of health expenditure to gross domestic product. All Japanese are covered by universal medical care insurance and all are provided with completely free access to the same medical care. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the medical care service is not as good as it looks. Owing to lack of competition between both hospitals and powerless insurers - the outcome of too many regulations - there is only a small incentive to improve the efficiency and quality of medical service. Furthermore, because of Japan's rapidly aging society and low birth rate, together with the long depression the economy has experienced, it is very difficult to maintain the 'pay-as-you-go' health system. For health system reform, our proposals are as follows: deregulating health markets, including pharmaceutical markets; strengthening the role of insurers; introducing information technology; and restructuring the healthcare of the elderly. We are expecting the new cabinet, which enjoys much popularity, to have the courage to initiate health reform along these lines, in spite of opposition from powerful interest groups, bureaucrats, and even members of ruling parties.

N2  - I address public choice from the perspective of economics in this essay. The perspective of economics is taken to mean the application of the principles of maximizing behavior and demand and supply to institutions and behavior in the political world. I begin with a discussion of this familiar methodology, and then proceed to illustrate how the principles of maximizing behavior and demand and supply can be applied to the various component parts of a representative democracy, including the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, as well as interest groups, bureaucracy, and voters. This will be in no sense a review of the literature. The point is to illustrate how economic principles can be applied to political behavior in each of the above contexts. In each case a single and simple illustration will be given. In such a way, the reader can decide whether the economic perspective really adds anything to the understanding of political behavior over and above alternative analyses. For example, do we learn more about a legislator's behavior with an assumption that he acts in his self-interest or in the public interest? Finally, although many of the illustrations are related to U.S. political processes, I endeavor in each case to generalize the discussion to an international setting. © 2008 Springer-Verlag US.

N2  - The article examines the introduction of socialist name giving
ceremonies in the GDR in order to pose broader questions about
church-state relations and the politicization of everyday life in the
late 1950s. Based on extensive archival material, the article focuses on
the contingencies often obscured by historical narratives that treat
socialist rites of passage as mere substitutes for church rites. An
analysis of the deliberations of party officials and state bureaucracies
about the name giving ceremony reveals a complex of trial and error and
experimentation and a series of unanswered questions about the specific
meaning of the new ritual. Unlike the socialist confirmation, the
Jugendweihe, which fulfilled a concrete function in the political
education of the youth and received continuous state support, the name
giving ceremony sheds a different light on the socialist state as an
altogether reluctant participant in ritual practices.

N2  - The phenomenon of corruption is common in Mali declining through-rights and other acts of patronage implies unequal treatment, a personification of trade. It embodies the basic rules of a court society and thus prevents the proper functioning of the bureaucratic state based on standards impersonalization, guaranteeing equal treatment. From these two separate registers, some anthropologists explain the recurrence and spread of the phenomenon of corruption by a common historical phenomenon of entrenchment of separate registers normative. In other words the principles of the court society precolonial were added, without removing them, the principles of the functioning bureaucracy set up by the French colonization. However, analysis of archives in the area of Bandiagara in Mali shows, on the contrary, the colonial power was never put in place rules of a game. It has reinforced the principles of individual companies to court and has perpetuated the favorite figures of the banned and the courtier. And that continuity was not always made consciously and without allowing slander to moral judgments such as the idea of decolonization too early to view the extent of corruption usually present.

N2  - The financialization of sovereign debt management has received attention in comparative political economy studies. While previous studies have highlighted the cross-national commonality of this process and the congruence of interests between finance and governments, the analysis of the role of finance and state agency in domestic reform processes is still under-exposed. By analysing the financialization of government debt management in the two early adopter countries, New Zealand and Ireland, this study seeks to close this gap. The study shows that differences in the structure of financial markets and the civil service systems resulted in different policymaking processes through which Treasury civil servants brought financial economics into the reforms. In New Zealand, economists had an in-house position within the Treasury and were able to frame the decision-making process (ideational explanation), while in Ireland, finance successfully lobbied senior civil servants who sponsored these efforts (interest explanation). With this finding, this article reveals the multiple channels that lead to sovereign debt management financialization.

N2  - Top bureaucrats are the nexus between politics and administration. Besides being the chief operating officer of the ministry, they are technical experts and political advisors to the minister. This makes them central actors in bureaucratic studies. Despite their powerful position, few have studied their path to power. Utilizing sequence analysis, I analyze the career trajectories of permanent secretaries, providing a rich measure of career paths. Denmark is used as a case of a European parliamentary system, and a novel dataset has been collected containing career information on permanent secretaries from 1925 to 2020. The analysis reveals five ideal-typical career paths and illustrates how career trajectories have become more diverse over time. Fewer top bureaucrats are rising through the ranks within a single ministry; instead, there has been an increase in inter-ministerial shifts and in experience providing political craft. Finally, the position is becoming a steppingstone rather than the final position.

N2  - In the 1970s policy making in the Netherlands took place in sectoral networks, consisting of professional interest groups and like minded civil servants, advisory councils, mp's and departmental ministers. In this article the author examines whether such a sectoral policy network still exists in Dutch health care by comparing past and present data on the background of civil servants, mp's and departmental ministers. Next she describes the political fight against the health care sectoral network, which has gone on for decades. She concludes that the health care sectoral network has been severely weakened, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a substantial reduction of health care costs, which was one of the main reasons why politicians fought against sectoral interests in the first place.

N2  - In this article, we explore the determinants of reforms intending to integrate policies and coordinate administrative units by focusing on necessary conditions. Firstly, we elaborate theoretical expectations about potential necessary conditions for cross-sectoral reforms. Secondly, we conduct a condition-oriented fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to examine our expectations, based on an original data set comparing policy integration and administrative coordination reforms, in environmental and unemployment policy, across 13 countries over 29 years. Our results indicate three necessary conditions for high reform intensity: external problem pressure is necessary for policy integration and administrative coordination in employment policy; either the strength or weakness of the reference party can take the role of necessary conditions depending on the policy field; low politicization of bureaucracy is necessary, especially for administrative coordination in environmental policy. These findings contribute to the development of a systematic theory of cross-sectoral policy and administrative change.

N2  - The federal government claims that the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) negotiations have been the most transparent and participatory in Canadian history. Labour, environmental, social justice, and other civil society groups that are critical of the proposed agreement for various reasons would argue that their perspectives have been excluded from the official federal dialogue. This article looks at some of the efforts of non-governmental (civil society) actors, and in particular the Trade Justice Network and its member organizations, to affect the CETA negotiations in other ways, with an emphasis on contact with provincial governments, municipalities, European decision makers, and other non-governmental groups in Canada and Europe. It is argued that the exclusion of critical views shows an inherent democratic deficit in the CETA negotiations that privileges corporate insiders at the expense of civil society, the public, and even elected officials. Notwithstanding this deficit, the success of the civil society campaigns can be seen in the problem areas delaying a successful conclusion of negotiations, including new public procurement restrictions for Canadian municipalities and pharmaceutical patent term extensions. For the Trade Justice Network, these areas also help explain how the agreement narrows the fields of economic, environmental, and social governance in Canada.

N2  - Dynamic science and technology development of Taiwan since 1970-s was entailed by the number of internal and external factors, the main of them, however, was the government policy. Till 1987, while the state of emergency remained valid and under the conditions of authoritarian political regime of Kuomintang, it was Taiwanese technocrats who worked out science and technology policy. The technocrats being loyal to presidents Chiang Kai-Shek and Chiang Ching-Kuo, to some extent were under the ideological influence of the Western science schools, had extensive personal and business relations with the Western, mostly American, businessmen and officials. The technocrats faced little influence from local interest groups as the latter were weak and discrete. Taiwanese technocratic government set up a strong science and technology base, promoted the establishment of state-funded research institutes (ITRI, III) and Hsinchu Science Park, which became the basement for the rapid S\&T development of Taiwan. Political and social changes started in the second half of 1980-s resulted in democratic transition, emergence of legal opposition in 1986 (Democratic Progressive Party) and the transformations of how political decisions were taken. Democratization of Kuomintang regime has led to complication of science and technology policy: on one hand, the competition between various governmental agencies has started, on the other hand, different interested groups gained enough power to put pressure on the government. Taking biotechnology as an example, in 2000-s, under the democratic conditions Taiwan's S\&T policy has been a compromise of the following political powers: 1) executive agencies (National Science Council, Council of Agriculture, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Academia Sinica, etc.); 2) political parties (green coalition under DPP, blue coalition under Kuomintang); 3) business groups: small and medium-sized enterprises as they are the most wide business layer, 4) academics, scientists and experts. Each power strives for promotion of its interests, allocation of resources and subsidies, carries out independent researches in its own realm. The power of the technocrats has eroded in the 2000-s, and this term is now seldom used to describe politicians in Taiwan. Although democratic transition has undermined the power of technocrats who created science and technology system of Taiwan in 1970-1990-s, by the 2000 the private sector has become mature enough to sustain S\&T development. The quantitative S\&T indicators show that Taiwan S\&T system remained its growth pace and become more private-funded and independent.

N2  - In recent years, increasing reference has been made to the issue area of
`women, peace and security', reflecting a set of norms that are
gradually becoming institutionalized within the UN. This article
explores the validity of such claims through an empirical study of the
relatively newly established UN Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) and the
extent to which gender language and concerns have been integrated into
the latter's founding resolutions and deliberations on peacebuilding
strategies. The article suggests that `women, peace and security'
concerns have emerged as a legitimate normative framework in the
peacebuilding context. The PBC has served an important role in
reinforcing this normative framework. However, the actual inclusion of
women in strategic thinking and policy development is still dependent on
the lobbying of dedicated norm entrepreneurs among member states, UN
bureaucrats and nongovernmental organizations.

N2  - The remarkable economic growth in Taiwan has served as a model of the developmental state as well as a source of scepticism about neoliberal policy for many less developed countries. However, since the mid-1980s Taiwan has gravitated from its previous statist model to the universally embraced 'market-orientated' restructuring. This study seeks to explain this neoliberal transition. A disaggregated approach is employed to break neoliberalism down into three distinct dimensions: Market openness, fiscal austerity, and privatisation of public sector enterprises. The analysis results confirm that: (1) Taiwan's trade dependency on the USA constituted a decisive factor in the state opening its domestic market; (2) distributional politics was forged in a new but weak democracy to incorporate more interest groups in the fiscal expansion of the postauthoritarian era; and (3) the slow but increasingly steady progress of privatisation plans was influenced not by a 'back-to-the-market' idea but by the statist legacy with which bureaucrats attempted to manage public sector enterprises even after they became de jure private firms. The theoretical implications of this transition are discussed in the conclusion.

N2  - How are bureaucrats controlled by their superiors in the Chinese political system? ``Leading small groups'' are among the most important mechanisms for integrating the interests and opinions of various government and Party departments so that superiors can ensure that their policies are implemented. This article analyzes the roles of the three main actors in the leading small groups: group leaders, the heads of the lead departments, and the office directors. We discuss how these individuals operate through formal institutional approaches and informal political channels. Group politics of this kind is moving China's decision-making process toward ``integrated fragmentation.'' We conclude that compared with previous Chinese regimes, Xi Jinping is making greater use of leading small groups to promote further reforms and to practice individualized centralization.

N2  - The article is devoted to the investigation of the formula for the appointment of officials in the French royal administration of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries: ``to introduce into office possession and seisin{''}. It's appearance in the 1360's. is established, as well as the stages of the posts'transformation into the object of ownership (fixing the staffs of departments and services of the crown of France, formalizing the contract with the king, developing criteria for selection for service on the principle of professional suitability, etc.) in the context of the transformation of the nature of the royal authority towards public power. The legal status of the offices changed under the influence of canon law ({''}clericalization of services{''} and their conversion into benefices). At the same time, private legal practices developed in the transfer of posts: a lifetime salary, a concession and the sale of offices. They were allowed to officials after a long period of service and impeccable performance of their official duties. To attract officials to the service was introduced a rule on the right of possession and seizin for positions held. Both components of the formula, taken from Roman and customary law, underwent a transformation within the framework of the medieval legal space. The article gives an analysis of the origin and evolution of both concepts in French law. As a result, it was shown that the introduction to the seizin of the office guaranteed the retention of the status of an official if he held a position for a long time and flawlessly fulfilled all the obligations on it, enshrined in the oath that he swore upon admission to the service. The conversion of office into possession on the status of the seizin gave the officials then the right to dispose of them from the moment they took office. The ritual of taking possession and seizin of the post reflected the public-legal nature of the royal administration: the publicity of the act of acceptance for service, performed not by the monarch, but by authorized agencies. As a result, the royal administration received legal guarantees of autonomy from the person of the monarch and political neutrality.

The wills of officials fix their specific group norms of behavior, particular culture and system of values. Corporate unity and group solidarity of officials were expressed in the form of choosing colleagues as executors with broad powers; through giving friends and colleagues money and valuables, uniforms and books as a common cultural fund; through deductions in favor of bureaucratic brotherhoods (St. Nicholas in Parliament, the four Evangelicals in the Chancellery, the Virgin Mary in Chatelet); testament money to pay services for the souls of colleagues. The ``collective executor{''} was the Parliament of Paris, defending the interests of colleagues and the group value system at all stages of the execution of wills.

N2  - From the end of World War II to the late-1980s, Macau was a Portuguese colony under Chinese patronage, together with an insulated bureaucracy and a passive political culture. Meanwhile, Macau was characterised by an official non-interventionist policy, a fragmentation of educational provision, and a lack of formal citizenship education. From 1987 onwards, Macau has been undergoing decolonalisation and an impending change of sovereignty, which resulted in the first official document concerning citizenship education issued by the government in 1995. But citizenship education has been less developed in Macau because of the problems of state capacity, autonomy and initiative in delivering education. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - Motivated by China's experience in the reform era, we study the fiscal relations between central and local governments embedded in a vertical control system with local officials appointed by the central government. The probability of their re-appointment depends, in part, on how well they perform in fulfilling their mandates from above. Self-interested local bureaucrats decide on the amount of predatory charges to be collected and the amount of public goods provided to increase their chances of survival, while at the same time maximizing the expected surplus accruing to their private agendas. Within the framework of this model, we explore how such issues as fiscal decentralization, local accountability and regional disparities interact with the stringency of the vertical control system. The paper also contributes to the discussion of the divergent experience of China and Russia.

N2  - This article discusses two recent cases of environmental civic participation in Georgia involving resistance to development projects and the attempts to protect public space in the capital city of Tbilisi-the cases of Vake Park and "Panorama Tbilisi." Despite their distinct lifecycles and levels of policy success, the two cases illustrate the same challenges to environmental civic participation in Georgia. The top-down challenge derives from government officials' reluctance to involve outside actors in environmental policymaking and their strategy of labeling environmental activists as politically biased and controlled by the officials' political opponents. The bottom-up challenge derives from environmental activists' limited policy advocacy capacities, in terms of both strategic diversity and evidence-based argumentation. These two challenges, reinforced by a cultural context of civic participation characterized by social nihilism, work together to encourage the exclusion of activists from environmental policymaking.

N2  - Among civil servants, are women less corrupt than men? The established
literature suggests that there is no gender gap in officials' attitudes
toward corruption when they are exposed to ample opportunities and
networks for corruption. Drawing on an original survey of Chinese civil
servants, this study explores the gender gap in tolerance for corruption
and the mediating effect of clientelism on the gender-corruption link.
The findings indicate that women's tolerance for corruption is
significantly lower than that of men in China, a country consistently
plagued by corruption. The study reveals that clientelism is a crucial
explanatory variable in the relationship between gender and tolerance
for corruption. Women are more likely to be excluded from clientelist
networks that facilitate corruption, meaning that they are less likely
to be exposed to a culture of corruption or to take advantage of
corruption. Women's lower acceptance of clientelism partly contributes
to their stronger inclination to reject corruption.

N2  - In this paper, I study the effect of political elites' career incentives
on China's trade policy formation. I propose a theoretical dynamic view
in which China's authoritarian leaders can preempt protectionist actions
of their selectorate (bureaucrats) by offering them future promotion
opportunities within the authoritarian hierarchy as long as the leaders
can credibly commit to these political promises. Drawing on a database
of China's sectors for 1999-2007, the empirical results support the
dynamic perspective that while political organization still matters for
China's trade policy outcomes, it is less likely for a sector with a
higher promotion expectation score to get politically organized.

N2  - This article demonstrates how theory can be built to explain cases of public administration reform failure in Asia. Drawing on the methodologies of middle range theory and grounded theory, qualitative data are gathered from the case of Cambodia and then analyzed. The result is the proposition that a specific constellation of reform-inhibiting factors explains the slow progress of public administration reform in Cambodia. At the center of the constellation is patronage. The cluster of surrounding and interrelated factors includes weak accountability, hegemonic political regime, high and legitimate power distance, low wages, and bureaucratic dysfunction. The chances of reform success increase with the removal or absence of these inhibiting factors. The analysis emphasizes the importance of political economy factors in determining the success or failure of public administration reform.

N2  - Under the authoritarian rule of President Suharto, Indonesia built one of the world's largest bureaucracies. However, it suffered from a range of problems including rampant corruption, inefficiency, poor service delivery and process orientation. Following democratization in 1998, the country's political leaders have experimented with various modes of public administration reform culminating in the system-wide bureaucracy reform of Presidents Yudhoyono and Jokowi that commenced in 2010. This article examines the nature of Indonesia's public administration reform in the democratic era using ideal type constructions that facilitate identification of what the reforms are and what they are trying to achieve while simultaneously setting out the current bureaucratic structures and behaviours and the difficulties they pose for the reformers. The article concludes that while progress has been made, Indonesia will not achieve its declared goal of creating a ``world class{''} public service by 2025 largely due to powerful forces resisting reform.

N2  - The article shows that modern corporate structures utilize all the possibilities of the territory of their presence and can lobby their interests through officials and deputies, use media resources and support protest activity. The neopluralistic approach to the relationship of the substantive need for professional GR and the dynamics of relations with the power environment at the regional level has undergone comprehension and systematization. Corporate policy is interpreted as a space constructed in the course of communication processes with various stakeholders. By analyzing the reproducing interactions between business and government at the regional level, conflictogenic factors and risks of GR-communications were revealed. As sources of information about GR, official documents of state bodies and business structures were examined. Non-financial reports of large companies operating in the Siberian Federal District contain information on corruption and risks of spot checks by officials. In these cases, officials can represent their commercial interests or the interests of competitors and others. Mass media can also prepare publications of a commissioned nature. In the framework of court proceedings, attempts are made to influence the judge outside the procedure, which is prohibited by law, but in 30\% of cases such appeals are made by commercial organizations and entrepreneurs. Such protest behavior is associated with economic activity in the territory, factors of legal culture and the availability of other means of resolving disputes. Corporate structures ensure direct representation of their interests in the regional parliament when this is not limited by the actions of competitors and the attentive public. In the Siberian Federal District, GR-communications are effective due to the limitations of the conflict nature of the political environment, the exclusion of the public from the discussion of many issues. As a result, GR-technologies are difficult to distinguish from the professional activities of legislators and experts in the interests of voters. The conclusion of the study is that the effectiveness and conditions of GR-communication are important for a holistic understanding of the mechanisms of representation of interests. It is also necessary to consider in more detail the reasons for the paradoxicality of GR-activity, which are rooted in the contextual characteristics of interaction with the authorities.

N2  - The objective of this paper is to examine the implementation of Colombia's tobacco control law. Methods involved are triangulated government legislation, news sources, and interviews with policy-makers and health advocates in Colombia. Colombia, a middle-income country, passed a tobacco control law in 2009 that included a prohibition on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship; and required pictorial health warning labels, ingredients disclosure, and a prohibition on individual cigarette sales. Tobacco companies challenged the implementation through litigation, tested government enforcement of advertising provisions and regulations on ingredients disclosure, and lobbied local governments to deprioritise policy responses to single cigarette sales. A transnational network including international health groups and funders helped strengthen domestic capacity to implement the law by; promoting public awareness of Ley {[}Law] 1335; training local health department staff on enforcement; facilitating health agencies' sharing of educational strategies; and providing legal defence assistance. This network included vigilant efforts by local health groups, which continuously monitored and alerted the media to noncompliance, engaged government officials and policy-makers on implementation, and raised public awareness. Support from international health NGOs and funders and continuous engagement by local health groups enhanced implementation capacities to counter continued tobacco industry interference and ensure effective tobacco control implementation.

N2  - Despite the dubiousness of most Spanish discourses of exceptionalism, Catalan politics in the 1930s was different. From the birth of the Spanish Republic in 1931, this difference was testified by the existence of a subsidiary political system – an autonomous regional government which acquired its own parliament and law-making powers in 1932. Within this institutional framework, the interacting pressures of leftist Catalan nationalism, a strong anarcho-syndicalist movement, and the eventual appearance of Marxist parties generated an original political demand which may be called populist. Starting with its overt politicisation in 1901, Catalan nationalism introduced the ideal of a new kind of regional administration. This administration was born of devolution and was carried out in the Catalan language. It was capable of substituting the failing central bureaucracy with the offer of better services (such as education) and of serving as a means of social promotion. Barcelona was the centre of the rise of modern rival corporativisms in Spain, as well as the debate surrounding the viability of civil society (and therefore of civic culture) in the face of state intervention. This had a surprising potential for peculiar (and often contradictory) understandings between the ideological and organisational polarities that developed and matured in the years during and after the First World War. The cultural protectionism of ‘Catalanism’ was offered especially to internal Catalan immigrants from the local countryside to the big city. © Cambridge University Press 2005 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to analyze the evolution during the 1930's of workers' unions in the sugar industry in Tucuman, a province located 1,200 kilometres north of Buenos Aires. It aims at examining the patterns of unionization and the consequences it brought with it in terms of representations, struggles and demands, through the study of newspapers, official documents, interviews and union and industrial sources. In a protected industry as the sugar production was, the fixation of profits had always been negotiated by those who were able to lobby through their organizations and corporations, at least until the arrival of Peron to power. In Tucuman, factory owners were the first ones to organize themselves, a path then followed by cane growers. Workers had historically protested and fought for better wages and working conditions, but their associations were weak and intermittent, and they faced serious difficulties to sustain them over time, a circumstance that undermined their chances to uphold their demands in the middle and long term and monitor agreements. This situation, however, started to change in the mid-thirties, when workers set up a stable union within a nationwide process of union growth. In real terms their accomplishments were limited but their main achievement was giving a counter-hegemonic sense to the traditional discourse about the sugar workers.

N2  - Background: Healthy-food financing initiatives have been endorsed as a way to improve food access, but relatively little research exists on understanding the formulation of such policies. Purpose: This paper investigates the development of the New Orleans Fresh Food Retailer Initiative (FFRI) to highlight factors that enabled and impeded its enactment. Methods: In 2010 and 2011, semistructured interviews were conducted with 22 key informants with firsthand experience of this case, including representatives from the private sector, nonprofit organizations, and government. A participant-observer approach was used to synthesize these observations with archived written materials and the authors' own observations. Results: Historical disparities in food access in New Orleans were exacerbated by Hurricane Katrina, which also generated neighborhood activism and a pressing need to rebuild the city. A Food Policy Advisory Committee (FPAC) was formed from diverse groups. This paper describes the evolution of FPAC, its deliberations and report to the City Council, and actions to promote a financing initiative, as well as delays encountered in the process. Conclusions: Enactment of the FFRI was facilitated by a window of opportunity that opened in the storm's aftermath, broad-based stakeholder buy-in, the existence of political champions, and policy-relevant information that was simple and convincing. Impediments to success included the constant turnover of city staff, a skeptical state bureaucracy, and the many competing priorities in New Orleans. This study highlights the importance of having a clear policy objective to address a well-defined and illustrated problem, key advocates in diverse organizations, and broad-based support for its implementation. © 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

N2  - A "hybrid democracy has evolved in Cambodia in which elections are regularly held and internationally endorsed. However, there are inherent defects beneath the facade of free and fair elections that result from the domination of the electoral arena by a single political party - the Cambodian People's Party (CPP). The intertwining of the CPP and the state initially offered the party a coercive mechanism that coopted and coerced voters and restricted opposition parties' activities in rural areas. Subsequently, as internal and external political legitimacy has increasingly been linked to democratic procedures, the CPP and Prime Minister Hun Sen have used their domination of the state machinery to cultivate patronage politics that not only links them to voters but also to government officials and business tycoons.

N2  - Private-sector planners in Turkey have been operating in a planning system that has been restructured within the framework of neoliberal urban policies for the last forty years. Especially after 2000, while the model of growth over construction was adopted as a basic economic policy, the planning practices that implemented these policies were seen as a means of capital accumulation by wider social groups. In this economic political environment, private-sector planners have entered into new relationships with politics, markets, and bureaucracy, and have settled in the centre of criticism with professional practices that fall behind the basic principles of the profession, such as land speculation and serving certain pressure groups instead of the public interest. This article focuses on the conditions in which private-sector planners realize their planning practices and the problems they encounter in their plan-making processes. According to private-sector planners, the most important problem is the increase in the determination of rent-oriented interest relations between public institutions and local market actors instead of public benefit in the planning process. Private-sector planners believe that at every stage of the planning process, politicians and market actors exert pressure on planners, and that these forces have caused Turkey's planning practices to decline. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - The article examines the origins of the arts council movement in the ideas of the Bloomsbury Group and John Maynard Keynes. The Bloomsbury Groups' sense of experimentation and flexibility, their willingness to take action to create new institutions, and their distrust of bureaucracy, influenced Keynes's development of a new model for state patronage of the arts in 1946. He took an organization established during the Second World War to employ artists and organize morale‐boosting tours of the performing and visual arts, and oversaw its development into the Arts Council of Great Britain, the first such arts council. His model–making grants of public funds through semi‐autonomous government bodies to private individuals and privately operated arts institutions–became a standard form of public funding for the arts by the end of the twentieth century in many countries around the world. © 2004, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - The article deals with the patronage network of the first Caucasian
Viceroy Michael Vorontsov. The research is based on the patronizing
letters of the Viceroy to the Director of the Caucasian Committee
Vladimir Butkov, as well as on the correspondence between Michael
Vorontsov and employees and supporters. Michael Vorontsov's fraction
consisted of representatives from various social groups: military,
officials, local nobility, religious leaders, merchant circles. This
diversity is explained both by the peculiarities of the personality of
the Caucasian Viceroy, who combined the qualities of a nobleman, an army
leader, a manager, and the socio-political conditions of the region
which was led by Michael Vorontsov. The Caucasian Viceroy managed to
form a reliable patronage network, which excluded the opposition and was
the basis of the regional autocracy of the Viceroy. The administrative
apparatus was made up of experienced officials who served with Vorontsov
in the Novorossiysk region. Among the local population who supported the
Viceroy was the Georgian princely clans, including the Orbeliani family,
as well as the Armenian merchants. The formation of a loyal fraction was
also necessary in the context of a confrontation with the Ministerial
bureaucracy, whose ties with local institutions were suppressed or
extremely formalized. Loyalty of clients was provided by promotions,
awards and material prosperity. The system created by Vorontsov proved
to be durable. His successors also relied in the capital on the
Caucasian Committee and its Director, and within the Viceroyalty - on
the same corporations and individuals who were patronized by the first
Caucasian Viceroy.

Its prominent characterizing features are discussed, with an emphasis on both the achievements and problem areas. Turkey has a long history of strong traditional bureaucratic practices and culture, from which its contemporary public administration system has emerged since the Republic was established almost a century ago. Despite its many achievements, public administration has its problems, generally the product of conflicts between tradition and modernity. Due emphasis should, however, be given to addressing the challenges of its over-politicization, strengthening governance practices, enhancing the human factor, and instituting further modern administrative reforms.

N2  - Approaching the notary public in Cadiz at the beginning of the 16th century, especially after a lawsuit followed by the Royal Council of the city against the royal notary public Diego González on the possession of a local notary office. The study is carried out in both its institutional and, to a lesser extent, documentary aspects, preferably from the point of view of practice documents, without, however, disregarding the legal framework. Thus, at the institutional level, aspects such as the number of notaries practising, appointment and access to the office are dealt with, as well as requirements and official channels with the relevant casuistry. In the documentary field, the work of notaries is outlined through the vision of their fellow citizens and, fundamentally, through the protocols they drew up and authenticated.

N2  - Firms spend a substantial amount on lobbying—devoting financial resources on teams of lobbyists to further their interests among regulatory stakeholders. Previous research acknowledges that lobbying positively influences firm value, but no studies have examined the parallel effects for customers. Building on the attention-based view (ABV) of the firm, the authors examine these customer effects. Findings reveal that lobbying negatively affects customer satisfaction such that the positive relationship between lobbying and firm value is mediated by losses to customer satisfaction. These findings suggest a dark side of lobbying and challenge current thinking. However, several customer-focused moderators attenuate the negative effect of lobbying on customer satisfaction, predicted by ABV theory, including the chief executive officer’s background (marketing vs. other functional area) and the firm’s strategic use of resources (advertising spending, research-and-development spending, or lobbying for product market issues). These moderators ensure consistency between lobbying and customer priorities or direct firm attention toward customers even while firms continue to lobby. Finally, the authors verify that lobbying reduces the firm’s customer focus by measuring this focus directly using text analysis of firm communications with shareholders. Collectively, the research provides managerial implications for navigating both lobbying activities and customer priorities, and public policy implications for lobbying disclosure requirements.

N2  - Economists have adopted two broad perspectives on the state: contractual (i.e., provider of public goods and services) and predatory (coercive and extractive). By a predatory state, we mean a state that promotes the private interests of dominant groups within the state (such as politicians, the army and bureaucrats) or influential private groups with strong lobbying powers. Neo-institutional economists support an extended version of the contractual perspective in which the state is not simply a ‘benevolent dictator’ but may itself be composed of predators. However, it considers predation as only a means to promote protection. By contrast, a predatory vision of the state argues that while protection and predation are two faces of the same coin, a predatory state protects only to promote its predation on the private sector. This symposium explores how a predatory approach to the state can shed light on all types of state, from liberal democratic to authoritarian and failed ones, both in the past and present.

N2  - In academic discussions it is widely noticed that lobbying is one of the public policy elements indicating quality of governance. However, in practise the concept often acquires negative connotations. The article discusses the lobbying phenomenon in Lithuania, examines the tendencies of lobbying activity and its development in 2000-2013 and analyses challenges for the public policy embedded by various interest groups in Lithuania. The analysis is based on the results of semi-structured in depth interviews with lobbying experts carried out in 2013. The study revealed the challenging issues about the gaps in lobbying legal regulation system in Lithuania. Despite the fact that Lithuania is one of a few countries in Europe which has legal regulation of lobbying activity, as a result of above mentioned issues it could be noticed that the official numbers of registered lobbyists do not represent the amount of lobbying activity in reality.

N2  - Purpose: The cooperation of interest groups in higher education and research sector enables economic growth and social development through implementation of innovative systems. Nevertheless, the empirical researches show a rather passive cooperation between stakeholders in higher education and research policymaking process. Moreover, interest groups representing society, various non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are left behind in the policy making process. The aim of this article is to disclose the existing NGO's role and to disclose the possible role of NGOs in the higher education and research policymaking process. Design/methodology/approach: The comparative analysis of the NGO's role in higher education and research policymaking process in Austria, Denmark, Great Britain, Finland, Hungary and Lithuania was conducted by applying the selected theoretical models. The study is concluded with recommendations concerning NGO's possible role in the higher education and research policymaking process. Findings: The analysis proved that NGOs fall into the cluster of Often Forgotten Players, which has little or no influence on higher education and research policy development. However, Finland, Denmark and Austria are distinctive in this respect, where NGOs are rather active players in higher education and research policymaking process. NGO's representatives of the mentioned countries illustrate the way of how to influence the higher education and research policy as well as to make an impact to socio-economical development. NGOs in the analysed countries can influence the higher education and research policy by performing the following functions: Creating a background for the development of internationally competitive clusters of excellence and expert panels (e.g. Finland ``Finn Sight 2015{''} project); Creating the national insight networks by cooperating with field experts and higher education and research institutions; Improving national competitiveness of innovation systems and developing the scientific research abilities by allocating the funds for high quality research projects. (e.g. Austrian Science Fund); Participating in strategic planning process by initiating the dialogues with interest groups and higher education and research policymaking institutions (e.g. Denmark); Acting as an independent expert for the evaluation and monitoring of the results created by higher education and research policy. The analysis of foreign experience of NGOs participation in the higher education and research policymaking process has illustrated several constructive examples. After analysing the experience of Finland and Austria in higher education and research policymaking process, we recommend the facilitation of active NGO's participation by creating the permanent working groups, which analyse economical, social, market trends and form the insights for the development of these areas. This would create a national insight network for ensuring the cooperation between NGOs, field experts as well as higher education and research policymakers. NGOs could act as supervisors of higher education and research policymaking via active cooperation with institutions. This would ensure the proper implementation of higher education and research policy tools. However, those tools could require the adaptations to specific context of countries' administrative cultures in the countries. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on the analysis of the official policymaking documents, which might be distant from reality. Originality/value: There is a lack of the empirical research done in the area of NGO's role in the higher education and research policymaking process. This study summarises previously performed researches and adds value by outlining the best practices of analysed countries.

N2  - Available studies on the accountability relation between social work and the government are mainly conducted in Anglo-Saxion countries. This limits the generalizability of these findings to other countries. Moreover, these studies hardly descent to the street-level, making the perceptions and actions of social workers barely visible. To address this gap, this article explores how three elements of governance interact with street-level accountability of social workers in homeless care in three country cases (the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany). The data (N26) was gathered by means of a mixed method design (interviews, focus groups and document analysis). By combining a street-level bureaucracy research approach with a relational definition of accountability, we opened up the black box of what happens in these organizations and bridged the gap between macro-level mechanisms and street-level accountability. Our study adds three important insights to street-level research of accountability in social work. First, elements of governance cannot be studied in isolation. Mechanisms should always be explained in relation to the context in which they are embedded. Second, the social workers in our cases do not perceive their accountability to the government as a professional obligation. They see it as a strategic mechanism to secure funding. Third, interaction is an important condition for the engagement of the social workers in their accountability relation with the government. More research is needed to develop a multi-level theory that identifies which mechanisms play a role in the accountability relation between the government and social workers.

N2  - In this article, I ask how senior civil servants (SCSs) practice functional politicisation. The literature suggests that they balance responsiveness with astuteness towards ministers, while maintaining neutral competence. However, functional politicisation is prone to affect this balance. Drawing on 160 h of ethnographic shadowing in Dutch government, I show three faces of functional politicisation; while directly advising ministers, in the preparation of policy advice and while working in the public eye. The findings suggest that senior civil servants actively try to align their fellow civil servants with their version of the minister's wishes. This practice of `proxy politics' calls for a shift in functional politicisation research from political `skills' to `authority claims' among senior civil servants. I conclude with urgent implications for politicisation theory and civil service practice.

N2  - Purpose This paper presents the results of an action research with a Brussels' police force. This research aimed to identify elements or mechanisms within police selectivity that put pressure on the relationship between the public and the police and affect the equal treatment of individuals and groups. Montjardet (1996) looks to understand structural, organisational of other factors as weighing on police selectivity. This article focusses more precisely on the interaction between organisational justice on striving to improve procedural justice. Design/methodology/approach This study was made possible through a partnership between UNIA, the PolBruNo police force and the National Institute for Criminalistics and Criminology (NICC). The methodology of this two-year action research around two phases. The first one led through (22) interviews with management, (200 h of) observations and three group analysis to a shared diagnosis of problems regarding police selectivity. The action part centered on intervisions with the patrol officers based during further (over 420 h of) observations, giving extra information that has been integrated in the analysis. Findings This research points out that even when police interventions are oriented by the demands of the public - public that sometimes formulates demands based on (ethnic) stereotypes - the intervention can be problematic. Organisational aspects played an important role in how the intervention unfolded: if those demands will be treated rather as orders given by the caller or as problematic situations needing analysis by the police officers. The paper arguments that organisational justice as experienced by the police officers impact how much consideration will be given to procedural justice. Originality/value Many scholars have shed a light on the various situations patrol officers deal with and identified problems regarding police selectivity. Procedural justice was developed as an interesting notion to look at the relation of police officers and the (diverse groups within the) public as well as the broader impact of these encounters. The importance to look to the organisational level in the decisions made by the police officers has also been established. The paper arguments that organisational justice as experienced by the police officers impact how much consideration will be given to procedural justice.

N2  - Motivation: Governments commonly support the advocacy role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in development, but studies argue that close linkages between government and CSOs are problematic. The Netherlands’ Dialogue and Dissent policy programme brings together the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs (NMFA) and 25 (alliances of) CSOs as advocacy partners. The programme is set up from an awareness of the challenging nature of such collaboration. Purpose: We contribute to understanding the ways in which issues with donor–CSO collaboration can be engaged in donor policies. This article addresses two questions: To what extent and how does this programme confront and overcome the challenges of close collaboration between government and CSOs? What practical lessons can be learned?. Approach: We conducted 33 (group) interviews with CSOs and policy officers involved with the Dialogue and Dissent programme, exploring their understandings, expectations and strategies as partners in the programme. We also analysed CSO programmes, policy documents and publicly available information. Findings: In Dialogue and Dissent, space for dissent, flexibility and relative equality between government and CSOs positively address mutuality and institutional pressures. Challenges remain as estimated strategic significance, diverging capacities and risks to autonomy work against mutuality. Certain challenges are engaged with, but we identified no strategies countering pressures that stem from managerialism within the NMFA, external political pressures and conflicting government objectives. While the programme counters tendencies towards institutionalization of CSOs as insiders, some important challenges to public engagement identified in the literature remain insufficiently addressed. Conclusions: Conditions built into policy can address challenges identified in the literature. However, challenges remain that are rooted in wider organizational and political realities. Lessons for practice are: (1) the advocacy role of CSOs can be advanced by building in certain formal conditions and advancing these informally; (2) flexibility allows for collaboration to develop as government and CSOs negotiate their roles, cognizant of pressures that get in the way; (3) challenges rooted beyond the support policy and government agency involved in the collaboration will constrict the power of policy design; (4) public engagement as a foundation for CSOs’ advocacy roles deserves much more attention.

N2  - This paper analyses the role of Cuban Americans and Iraqi Americans as
allies of like-minded public officials in the marketing of contested
foreign policies to the United States public. Each of these ethnic exile
communities played a traditional lobbying role as would be expected of
interest groups, but the argument here is that the interactive
relationship between the ethnic interest groups and government officials
in advocating policy is the more interesting development in these cases.
While there are differences in the two cases, the similarities between
marketing an embargo and an invasion suggest that foreign-policy
analysts may want to pay closer attention to the interactive
relationship between exile communities and government officials in
policy advocacy. I suggest in conclusion that we need to be wary of
according defectors and exiles privileged positions in future
foreign-policy debates.

N2  - Members of Parliament (MPs) request policy evaluations and use the resultant findings to inform law-making and hold the government to account. Since most elected representatives have developed strong ties to interest groups, one might wonder whether these privileged relationships influence MPs’ parliamentary behavior. This study investigates how MPs’ affiliations to groups affect their demand for policy evaluations. Empirical evidence shows that, regardless of respective party or individual characteristics, MPs are more likely to request evaluations in those policy domains where they have a group affiliation. This effect holds even when controlling for a classical measure of MP's policy specialization, such as legislative committee membership. These findings suggest that ties between MPs and specific types of interest group should be considered when explaining parliamentary behavior across different policy domains. Point for practitioners: To influence the policymaking process, interest groups participate in consultation procedures and parliamentary hearings, they lobby elected officials and deliver policy expertise to decision-makers. These advocacy strategies are well studied. This article innovates by showing that, in addition, interest groups foster the development of policy evaluations. MPs affiliated to an interest group active on a specific issue are likely to request policy evaluations in that policy domain. Interest groups strengthen the parliamentary demand for evaluation studies and, thus, may potentially contribute to the accountability of government and public administration.

N2  - Nowadays society requires new competencies of its specialists and citizens. The competencies of civil service employees must meet the requirements of the professional sphere and take into account the demands of the digital economy. The purpose of the study is to determine the key competencies of civil servants required in the conditions of digital transformation of the civil service, and to make recommendations for their development through the introduction of a competence-based approach to the assessment and formation of personnel, diversification of training areas, covering the issues of training in the workplace, exchange of experience and knowledge with colleagues, the introduction of modern analytical tools to support the functions of recruiting, building career tracking and individual competence development of the employee. The article provides a review of the main positions of the competence approach to the formation of human resources. The group of competences is defined. Based on the survey, a rating of the competencies of civil servants is compiled; the characteristic problems of the civil service that prevent successful career advancement and development of the civil service in general are highlighted. The results indicate the inertia of the public civil service system in the field of talent management and career tracking, insufficient or complete lack of interest in new formats of communication and training to form soft skills. The competency-based approach to talent management and career planning can be implemented within a single digital platform. The basis of such a platform should be formed by the ontological model. Data research tools will enable to carry out an objective selection of personnel for the position, determine the development program and build career tracking, as well as measure the effectiveness of the head of the department. The results of the study can be useful in setting professional standards in the field of public administration.

In public choice theory, the actors are individuals (such as voters, politicians, bureaucrats and lobbyists), not countries or states. As individuals, they may be members of collective organizations. Within these organizations, they may take collective decisions according to the rules which they or others have agreed upon. © Michael Reksulak, Laura Razzolini and William F. Shughart II 2013.

N2  - Euro-lawyers can appear as an enigma to anyone studying the EU polity. While European studies have given law a critical role not only as the engine of the integration process but also as the principal source of legitimacy of the EU itself, we actually know very little about the people whose task it is to control and develop European law. The invitation issued more than twenty years ago by prominent scholars from the field of European studies to analyse the ‘community of EC lawyers’1 (that is, those who ‘create’ everyday law, such as the judges at the Court of Justice, law professors, business lawyers, barristers or the legal advisors to the EC institutions, and so on) has hardly been accepted.2 In comparison with other professionals whose role in the European construction is widely known (such as national and EU civil servants, journalists, lobbyists or unionists3), Eurolawyers remain a sort of terra incognita.4 While jurists appear in some respects to be omnipresent in the European construction-their contributions are noticeable everywhere-they are at the same time almost invisible, as the ‘social ensemble’ they constitute fails to exist as an organized and unified group or profession. Decades of mobilizations in building a dense network of transnational legal associations like the Fédération internationale pour le droit européen (FIDE), professional bodies such as the Conseil consultative des barreaux de l’Europe, and specialized law journals or research institutes such as the Académie de droit européen de Trèves have not succeeded in building a common understanding of what a Euro-lawyer is-or should be. © Hanne Petersen, anne Lise Kjær, Helle Krunke and Mikael rask Madsen 2008.

N2  - In this article, we examine the difficult leadership position President Barack Obama inherited as he took office with respect to science and technology policy making and implementation, particularly following the Bush administration and years of the so-called ``war on science.{''} We contend that the Obama administration's challenge is not only to take substantive policy action, but also to reform certain administrative practices, particularly in light of the previous administration's practice of the politics of strategic vacancies, a managerial technique that rearranges an agency's ideological inclinations not through the usual forms of active politicization (i.e., by filling the appointee ranks with like-minded ideologues) but instead by ``starving{''} the agency of staff and co-opting its agenda that way.

N2  - This paper investigates to what extent East Germans are represented in the German administrative elite. Based on an original dataset of 512 appointments of top civil servants (TCS) in the Eastern German Länder and Berlin between January 2000 and December 2019, it is investigated (1) whether the descriptive representation of East Germans increases over time and (2) how commonalities and differences between TCS with East or West German origin develop over time. The focus here is on their educational and career background as well as on party politicisation. Findings reveal a clear temporal effect: the descriptive representation of East Germans in top positions in the civil service increases over time. Still, East Germans remain highly under-represented in Eastern Germany’s administrative elite. Another important finding is that TCS increasingly converge over time in terms of their educational and career background. A similar converging trend is observable with regard to party politicisation. These findings indicate a trend towards ‘normalisation’, i.e. an increasing adaptation to West German standards. This adaptation process, however, is taking longer than expected as the after-effects of the West German ‘elite imports’ in the early 1990s are enduring and profound. © 2022 Association for the Study of German Politics.

N2  - This article explores the influence of two types of signalling on the career success of civil servants in the federal ministerial bureaucracy of Germany. Whereas ‘ability signalling’ displays bureaucratic expertise in the sense of both political craft and administrative management competencies, ‘intention signalling’ indicates party politicization. Data are drawn from the biographies of 341 civil servants within the two highest ranks in federal ministries and the chancellery who held office between 2002 and 2013. Taking gender, formal education and career patterns into consideration, we are able to find clear evidence for ‘intention signalling’, whereas ‘ability signalling’ plays only a minor role. Over time, the accelerating effect of ‘intention signalling’ on administrative careers is increasing. Points for practitioners: How important is political loyalty for senior civil servants in merit bureaucracies? This article investigates the relationship between the merit principle and politicization in the German federal bureaucracy. By analysing the importance of certain career steps, we find clear evidence for party politicization. Employment in positions that signal party political loyalty accelerates the careers of ministerial officials, even if the data also prove that there is no distinct ‘fast track’ to leading administrative positions in Germany. Moreover, our analysis reveals an under-representation of women in administrative top positions, as well as the continuing dominance of lawyers. Regarding career patterns, considerable differences between state secretaries and directors-general are evident.

N2  - The article analyzes the extent to which democratization increased the level of legislative control over the budget process during the first twelve years of democracy in Mexico. Two components of legislative oversight are examined in detail: Hacienda's financial information available to legislators and the legislation regulating the government's capacity to allocate and reallocate federal funds. The article finds that while legislators have formal rights to control the bureaucracy, public officials have informal leverage over members of Congress, as well. By distributing resources that legislators can use for patronage purposes, bureaucrats obtain legislators' consent to implement programs at their convenience.

N2  - Aims: This case study identifies the influence and mechanisms that the alcohol industry in Brazil has been able to bring to bear to maintain self-regulation in the marketing of beer and many wines set against a trend of increasing alcohol consumption in Brazil, particularly among young people and women. It identifies the forms of power and strategies used by the alcohol industry in Brazil that may be useful for other countries to consider in seeking to move from self-regulation to state regulation of alcohol marketing. Method: A review was conducted of recent legal documents and court cases, as well as the activities of alcoholic beverage industries. Results: Because of an exemption, Brazilian law had established that both beer and many wines are not alcoholic beverages for marketing purposes. These beverages are subjected to industry self-regulation codes. Research shows that beer and wine marketing often violates industry codes, with little or no enforcement of penalties for non-compliance. Attempts to include beer and wine in the legal definition of alcohol have been opposed by the alcohol industry, and the courts have delegated responsibility to the legislature. The recent legal activities surrounding alcohol sales during the 2014 World Cup games in Brazil provide evidence of the alcohol industry's influence on the legislative process. Conclusion: The alcohol industry in Brazil plays a significant role in the formulation of public policies on alcohol, especially regarding the regulation of marketing. This power is exercised by strong lobbying of government officials responsible for public policies.

N2  - This article reviews lobbying in the political sciences and public relations literature, and it also provides a conceptualization for the regulatory practices of lobbying around the world. Then, it presents the newest law on lobbying instituted in 2010 in the Republic of Slovenia, the Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act. This Act treats lobbying in two ways: (1) as a communication technique used by interest groups to privately influence government officials and (2) as a process of access to information by the same interest groups. This inconsistency follows the same trend for lobbying regulation in Europe and raises important questions regarding lobbying practice and regulation. Lobbying is fundamentally a public relations practice exercised in private and public sectors, and it uses direct and indirect communication between interest groups and their respective government.

N2  - In post-2000 Zimbabwe, the rule of law was undermined as ZANU(PF) dismissed the importance of judicial independence in order to promote its land reform programme. The assumptions of disorder and a lack of institutional strength that mark understandings of the postcolonial African state may thus appear appropriate to the analysis of the negotiation of power and authority within the Zimbabwean state. A focus on a politics of disorder does not, however, further our insights into the practical and conceptual place of law and judicial institutions in Zimbabwe. Examining the dynamics within one state institution, the Attorney General's office, I explore the circumstances under which, and the manner in which, the office was politicised, and how those working in or with the office made sense of this process. Officials invoked two registers, one of corruption and politicisation and another of professionalism and 'justice', to explain their experiences with, and expectations of, the Attorney General's office. These views highlight the centrality of contestations over the nature of the judiciary in the imagination of Zimbabwe's state by civil servants, rather than simply demonstrating a weakened, disordered, or hollowed-out state institution. © 2013 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.

N2  - Plain language summary In 2005, Ethiopia's government, health advocates, and service providers secured a more liberal abortion law that has been instrumental in reducing maternal deaths due to unsafe abortion. However, these fragile gains are vulnerable because the in-country sexual and reproductive health sector has relied heavily on external funding. The U.S. government has been an important development partner to Ethiopia for global health and, in particular, reproductive health and family planning. As a result, the Global Gag Rule, reimposed and expanded by the Trump administration in 2017, impacted sexual and reproductive health and rights in Ethiopia. U.S. agencies and departments attached this policy to U.S. global health assistance for nongovernmental organizations that were critical partners in service delivery and advocacy. In a country like Ethiopia with a progressive environment for sexual and reproductive health, including safe abortion care, it remains important to examine the impacts of the Global Gag Rule, despite being rescinded in January 2021 by the Biden administration, as the policy has still not yet been permanently repealed and could be reinstated by future administrations. PAI's research sought to document the impacts of the expanded Global Gag Rule on sexual and reproductive health in Ethiopia, with a focus on safe abortion care. Study participants reported that nongovernmental organizations serving rural populations, adolescents and youth, sex workers, and people living with HIV/AIDS were impacted by the loss of U.S. government funding due to noncompliance with the policy. Organizations that chose to comply with the policy were forced to stop critical activities like training on safe abortion care. Outcomes also included self-censorship out of fear of the policy and dismantled partnerships between compliant and noncompliant organizations. Background Ethiopia's government and civil society have driven crosscutting initiatives in the last 15 years to improve sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including passing a 2005 abortion law that facilitated reduced rates of maternal death due to unsafe abortion. However, both the government and nongovernmental organizations have relied on external funding for sexual and reproductive health and rights, particularly from the U.S. government, which has been Ethiopia's largest global health donor. This article explores how the implementation and expansion of the 2017-2021 U.S. foreign policy "Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance," also known as the Global Gag Rule-which attached itself to a nongovernmental organization's funding-impacted sexual and reproductive health and rights, including safe abortion care, in Ethiopia. Methods This article is based on research conducted by PAI staff in Ethiopia in 2018 with follow-up in 2019. PAI held in-depth semistructured interviews with representatives of 30 organizations in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. Among these groups were U.S.-based and non-U.S. nongovernmental organizations, including community-based organizations, non-U.S. government donors, and Ethiopian government officials. Results Nongovernmental organizations have been essential to sexual and reproductive health service provision and advocacy in Ethiopia. Because of the sector's reliance on U.S. global health assistance, these organizations; their activities; and, consequently, the wider health system were negatively impacted by the Global Gag Rule. Certain vulnerable groups, particularly adolescents and youth, have traditionally relied on the private sector for sexual and reproductive health services. PAI's research demonstrates that U.S. policy disrupted activities and service delivery, threatened the closure of private clinics, stalled mobile outreach, and impacted safe abortion training of health personnel. Additionally, the Global Gag Rule dismantled partnerships, affected non-U.S. government donors' investments, and caused confusion that limited activities permissible under the policy. Conclusions The Trump administration's Global Gag Rule forced non-U.S. organizations to choose between providing comprehensive care or losing U.S. global health assistance, ultimately impacting populations in need of services. Ethiopia provides a clear example of how the Global Gag Rule can threaten a country's domestic health agenda by targeting nongovernmental organizations that are vital to health service delivery and safe abortion care.

N2  - The article sheds light on the circumstances preceding the enactment of explicit deposit insurance in Russia in December 2003. It may help to understand the subsequent performance of this institution. The author relies on available banking statistics as well as qualitative information of different natures. The formal deposit guarantee emerged in countries with advanced market economies and financial systems in the absence of state-owned banks. In Russia, a small group of politicians and experts started promoting deposit insurance since 1993. The main interest groups, such as core deposit-taking banks and their depositors, presented little demand for law in this domain. The advantages of an explicit scheme were unclear in the Russian context because the bulk of household deposits were kept in a state-owned savings bank. Material conditions were not mature in the 1990s: the government was financially weak, market economy institutions were missing, and the banking sector embraced many improper players. Deposit guarantee was incapable of addressing the main concern of the households, namely how to recover the savings lost due to hyperinflation in the early 1990s. The author assumes that the champions of deposit guarantee in Russia were driven by a combination of motivations: idealism and good intentions influenced by the experiences of the United States and other countries, or the ``demonstration effect{''}; the desire to disrupt the monopoly of Sberbank and boost the competitiveness of privately-owned commercial banks in order to boost bank competition, just for the sake of it; and the search for a new field of activity for a certain clan of civil servants and politicians. The conclusion is that subjective factors were the ones underpinning the debate around deposit insurance law.

N2  - This article investigates the way in which the World Bank constructs knowledge on poverty by identifying analytic institutions inside the organisation where ideas are developed, 'anti-poverty advocates' that populate these institutions and the strategies they employ to foster their agenda. By doing so, the article challenges two common critiques against the organisation. First, the Bank is often seen as an instrument of powerful industrialised countries to impose Western norms on developing countries; second, the Bank has contributed to worsening the situation in developing countries through the policies adopted. I argue that both assumptions are overstated. First, an in-depth analysis of the organisation's operational and organisational level shows a high level of internal advocacy that provides evidence that the Bank as a bureaucracy independently shapes global politics. Second, comparing the discursive level with developments on the policy and operational level reveals that the poverty or social agenda has grown incrementally from the late 1960s even in times when neoliberalism dominated world politics and economy. The article goes beyond such an organisational analysis in critically assessing how the Bank, by making developing countries 'legible', has provided standardised responses that ignore local social knowledge with the consequence of crude and self-defeating interventions.

N2  - The aim of the following article is to analyze how the composition of the cabinets affects the creation of centralized bureaucracies in the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil. I argue that the higher the cost of managing the coalition, the greater the likelihood of the centralization of public bodies in the Presidency. The study analyzes 172 bodies created by the Brazilian federal public administration from 1990 to 2009, with individual bodies serving as the unit of analysis. With the aim of gauging the extent to which centralization shapes the Presidency, my binary dependent variable is whether a body created within the hierarchy of the Presidency or reallocated from the ministries to the Presidency. In order to assess the effects of the degree of conflicts among the coalition's preferences on the probability of presidential centralization, four binary logistic regression models were estimated, with the degree of ideological dispersion in the cabinet; the degree of politicization in the coalition; the degree of party fractionalization in the cabinet, and the degree of ideological extremism analyzed as key factors to the study.

N2  - In this article I discuss the conditions under which social equality may arise and be reproduced, while focusing in particular on the institutionalization of states. Taking three ethnographic examples from Norway as my point of departure, I investigate how political scientist Stein Rokkan's perspective on cross-cutting cleavages may be used to provide a deeper insight into the management of power in public institutions. I further discuss how people's values and interests are translated into political alliances and how the patterns of conflict generated influence institutions formally and informally. A methodological argument forwarded in relation to this is that in order to gain analytical insight into how institutions are embedded and in part controlled in (more or less local) social systems and networks, we have to investigate how people move across formal institutional boundaries, roles and loyalties. Alliances that generate shifting and cross-cutting conflicts may give rise to horizontal forms of solidarity within formal, hierarchical institutions and in this way contribute to controlling power from below, but also to delimiting the effects of politicization processes and insensitivity in public bureaucracies.

N2  - There is growing interest in how activist bureaucrats change policies; however, it remains unclear how bureaucrats become activists. This article develops a framework for the emergence of bureaucratic activism using the case of Brazilian prosecutors in the Belo Monte dam, a project that drew attention due to its social and environmental impacts. I show that two different types of prosecutors were involved in this case: activist prosecutors, who were committed to the proactive defense of affected communities, and conventional prosecutors, neutral agents that resorted to traditional tactics. Based on 82 interviews, document analysis, and participant observation, I argue that rather than being self-selected, prosecutors within conducive settings engaged in activism after they joined the state by developing long-term ties with local groups. By discovering the problems faced by affected communities and mediating their struggles with other policy actors, prosecutors internalized the grievances of these groups, building commitments to defend their causes.

N2  - Scholars traditionally frame presidential efforts to politicize the federal bureaucracy as the result of divergence between the president's preferences and an agency's output. The authors argue that presidential concern with agency output is dynamic and is in part conditioned by the president's relationship with the public. To assess the relationship between politicization and public opinion, the authors use a data set that combines information on presidential efforts to politicize the Council of Economic Advisers from 1989 to 2004 with that of public attitudes concerning the president's handling of the economy. Their results indicate that public opinion does indeed bear a marginal, yet statistically significant, influence on presidential efforts to manage the federal bureaucracy, thus, providing a new contribution to the debate concerning presidents and the politics of bureaucratic structure.

N2  - This chapter describes, both from a personal and historical perspective, the ascendancy and incumbency of Leroy D. Baca as sheriff of Los Angeles County, comparing and contrasting his leadership, ensconced in new age terminology, with that of his predecessors, Sherman Block and Peter J. Pitchess. Of immediate concern were his personal decisions, in particular the appointment of Paul Tanaka to be his under sheriff after many years serving as his campaign treasurer. What was considered a marginally functional merit-based promotional system was transformed into a political patronage model, with the attendant loss of organizational legitimacy and tarnished public reputation. The chapter will compare and contrast life within the "car as the term is commonly used within the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and life outside the car, through first-hand accounts, testimony from the Citizen's Commission on Jail Violence, depositions, and published reports. Using the concept of representative bureaucracy, I will track organizational diversity as a performance measure using the relative inclusion of all employee groups in the rank structure of the department and how each group fared under the Baca/Tanaka administration. In conclusion, this chapter will present different coping mechanisms utilized by employees confronting serious corruption issues that impacted them directly, and indirectly through the organization.

N2  - Foreshadowed by the anti-war cause, women’s and gay liberation struggles, and the conservation movement, and inspired by Peter Singer’s 1975 book Animal Liberation, a fresh wave of animal activism emerged in Australia in the mid-seventies. In the struggle for animal rights, campaigners used a range of methods, but what characterised the eighties was their lobbying. They engaged politicians, built alliances, and participated in the state. By doing so, they changed Australian politics: they extended the political agenda; influenced public policy; and reshaped the state bureaucracy to include new avenues for addressing animal protection. At the same time, their outcomes were limited, sometimes founded on compromise and failure. The property status of animals was a fundamental constraint that produced differentiated and contradictory policy outcomes. The degree to which the animal movement succeeded in reducing animal suffering is a contentious matter that divides minimalist and maximalist accounts. Ultimately, however, animal advocates were instrumental in advancing the basic animal protection framework evident in Australia today.

N2  - The United States is enamored of the culture of opportunity, usually cast as the chance for individuals to improve their economic lots in life. In this culture, individuals can always remake themselves. And in rare circumstances, cities can, too. While the opportunity to remake implies betterment, it can involve erasure of things people take to be central to their lives. When openly debated, the meanings of opportunity and the role of government in creating opportunities are not a given; they may be highly contentious because individuals and groups have differing, even conflicting, interests and visions about courses of action if not the meanings of opportunity. To some observers, the human catastrophe following Hurricane Katrina forced a moment of "opportunity" to remake New Orleans. So much of the city had been damaged or destroyed that it was if not a blank slate, certainly a space where much reimagining and redoing of the city's infrastructure, neighborhoods, and housing could take place. Proposals for New Orleans ranged from Dennis Hastert's (2005) notorious comment that perhaps it should not be rebuilt at all to plans for a smaller footprint for the city (Meitrodt and Donze 2005) to more inclusive ideas for most neighborhoods to be largely reconstituted. But one person's opportunity may be another's catastrophe; one New Orleans Katrina survivor, for example, remarked, "This isn't an opportunity. It's a goddamned tragedy" (Klein 2007: 4). Responding to the tragedy or opportunity, the many plans for the future New Orleans expressed distinct interests, values, and visions. Because a planning process frequently begins with a willingness to think outside the box or to reject the usual socioeconomic and cultural constraints, a plan of an expression of hope, a statement of how the city can be not marginally but drastically improved. In this time of environmental concerns, for example, many plans proposed green ideas-open spaces, new types of housing, nonautomobile- based transportation. One plan, however, may negate others' aspirations. As two observers write, "But the vision of New Orleans' poorest neighborhoods being remade as mixed-income meccas, with tree-lined streets and bustling parks, has run smack up against another imperative of the post-Katrina era: building back low- income housing so that poor New Orleanians can return home and land jobs in the recovery economy" (Maggi and Filosa 2006). Eradicating the "blight" of public housing and building mixed-income housing runs against the "right of return, " asserted in different forums and derived in part from the United Nations statement on displaced persons (Inniss 2007).1 The earliest plan, Bring New Orleans Back (BNOB), drawn up by a group appointed by Mayor Ray Nagin in the weeks after Katrina, advocated more green spaces for the city, particularly in low-lying areas. Residents rejected the idea since those spaces would have eliminated their neighborhoods.3 One door opens only to close another; opportunities create and erase. Planning for a new New Orleans has suffered from many constraints that intensify this dynamic of creation and erasure and raise questions about government's contributions to this effort. The hurricane devastated the city and destroyed or severely damaged neighborhoods and the physical, economic, social, and governmental infrastructure. The city was and is poor, the tax base low, and the school system and criminal justice systems dysfunctional; residents struggle with day-to-day survival. Neither New Orleans nor Louisiana is noted for efficient or effective government, and since Katrina, the federal government has seemed to pay little constructive attention to the state or city. Some think that the George W. Bush White House was convinced that government cannot govern well and so did not try to make federal agencies competent (Wolfe 2006). Blunders by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) during and after the storm are the federal government's best-known failures, but such failures continued after the storm. Another "deadly blow" was "Treasury Secretary [John W.] Snow's refusal to guarantee New Orleans municipal bonds, forcing Mayor Nagin to lay off 3, 000 city employees" (Davis 2006). Mike Davis wrote that by April 2006, "saving New Orleans was no longer high on the Bush agenda, " if it ever had been. The stakes for rebuilding a post-Katrina New Orleans are high. The future of one of the most deeply rooted African American cities is at risk, as is the role of government in supporting its citizens in times of crisis. Indeed, the politics of planning for this city casts serious doubt on government's ability and willingness to play a major part in reconstructing New Orleans in any kind of equitable fashion. With white flight from the 1950s on, New Orleans became a black-majority city in the 1960s and began to experience population loss.3 The city has long struggled with economic and political adversity but nevertheless has a history of vital neighborhoods across classes and deep connections of people to place.4 Until Katrina, New Orleans was a vibrant African American community. And post-Katrina, residents' reactions and activism, rooted in this community, have enlivened democratic culture and civil society and tested their role and government's in the ways in which democracy works in the United States. Contestation of visions enriched the civic culture of the city. The planning processes prompted energetic political engagement, especially around issues of neighborhoods and housing. Broad, impassioned political debate took place among those who lost the most as well as among those who thought they could profit the most in the rebuilding. The assemblies, actions, plans, and hopes of those participating brought people out to face one another in struggle over whose plans should prevail. Democratic engagement, even among the most marginalized, was notable as all kinds of different people entered civic space to have a role in rebuilding homes and communities. Democracy in its grandest visions requires a participatory public sphere in all its dimensions, and even a minimal level of democracy requires a functioning, vocal, and organized public sphere. Public here encompasses both government and civil society and speaks to the relationships among government and residents. In a democratic public sphere, people across class, race, and other hierarchies are actively involved with government and with one another in determining visions, opportunities, and outcomes. Some visions may prevail, some may be modified, and others may fail to win support, but everyone's voice can be expressed and should be respected. Silencing or erasure-where people's voices are widely excluded from the development and implementation of plans-does not occur in a vibrant public sphere. Further, a lively and open public sphere means that major decisions about social investment and rebuilding are not left solely or primarily to the market, where inequalities continually reinforce themselves. Those without property or the ability to invest funds in redevelopment are just as much a part of a genuinely public planning process as the more privileged members of society. In a fully functioning democracy, the public sphere offers protections against erasure of visions, communities, and neighborhoods through open debate, consideration of policy alternatives, and adoption of broadly representative policies. In post-Katrina New Orleans, government failures and rejections energized civil society. Intense community organization among Katrina survivors and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) assured that their visions for their neighborhoods and homes have had a public airing and that they have been part of political action on the ground. Residents and NGOs have moved ahead with rebuilding, sometimes with governmental assistance, like the Road Home program, 5 sometimes independently of or in opposition to government.6 Advocates of public housing determinedly acted through protest and litigation to resist its demolition. Continual pulling and hauling has occurred over visions of opportunity and realities of responses. Government actions and inactions roiled residents, who organized to start rebuilding and to resist making New Orleans anew when doing so meant erasure of their neighborhoods or homes. The failures of one segment of the public sphere, government, have spurred action in another, civil society. While the civic culture of post-Katrina New Orleans has been greatly enriched, it has yet to produce the policy effects desired by many of those involved. Visions for housing have encountered other visions. And in some instances, government officials have directly thwarted goals for rebuilding. For example, federal and local public housing officials, including the city council, have decided to tear down the four major remaining public housing communities. Although New Orleanians have moved well beyond their initial shock from the devastation into action and sought a substantial role in rebuilding the city, the city, state, and federal governments have either failed to act on or have rejected many of the residents' visions.7 A democratic culture should but does not necessarily result in broad government responsiveness to the aspirations expressed by those actively involved. Democracy may work at one level but not at another. The civic culture may run up against government's limited resources, entrenched interest groups, bureaucracy, and lack of experience with an engaged citizenry. All of these factors have influenced the planning process in post- Katrina New Orleans and resulted in great disappointments for many of the participants. © 2010 by University Press of Mississippi.

N2  - On the one hand, political corruption has very negative effects on the economy and development of countries and societies. Perceived corruption is significantly associated with less satisfaction with democracy, less satisfaction with government, more of a sense that breaking rules is justifiable, less institutional trust, less interpersonal trust, and less interest in politics. On the other hand, organized crime has a pernicious impact on governance and economic development. Organized crime and political corruption go together because mafia type activities tend to erode the integrity of those holding a public office, including those responsible for upholding the rule of law. Where organized crime groups are powerful, legislation, policy-making and legal rulings no longer serve the general interest but the interests of the few. These dark networks are very dangerous for the rule of law and can produce failed states. Tolerating organized crime implies letting grand corruption penetrate into government and destroy the bedrock of the State. The research question of this article is: Is it possible to fight against the organized crime without a professional and meritocratic bureaucracy? The hypothesis is that it is essential to have a meritocratic State infrastructure so that the fight against dark networks will be effective. According to different studies, well performing police services and independent, professional judiciaries seem to make a difference in controlling organized crime. In order to validate these statements, it has been chosen the case of Mexico's fight against drugs. This war is having serious strategic problems and risks a possible failure. Following the line of discussion, the author believes that one of the most important causes of this situation is the lack of a bureaucratic police system. It has been studied the human resources management of the Mexican police and it has been found very serious breakdown in the system. Building on this research and previous scholarly studies of State formation processes, the basic proposition of this paper is that a bureaucratic infrastructure affects institutions and social outcomes. Mexico's fight against drugs shows us how important is having a meritocratic and professional police when confronting organized crime.

N2  - Until the oil-based `energy crisis' of 1973, the American Petroleum Institute and other private interests created the vast majority of energy statistics consumed in the United States. As the OPEC embargo set in, however, the American Petroleum Institute and the petroleum companies fell under a pall of perceived conspiracy. The US executive branch began creating its own statistics as part of the newly created Federal Energy Agency, but legislators quickly came to believe that the agency was purposely skewing the data to support the president's policies. In this context, Congress set about, again, to create a statistics-building group, which became known as the Energy Information Administration, that would be `independent' from both presidential and legislative politics and that could manufacture trust. This article argues that federal bureaucrats used various means, both interpersonal and mechanical (mathematical and statistical), to build credible energy information and analysis.

N2  - This work aims to study the growth of Italian central bureaucracy in the years of Fordism «punto di rottura strutturale dei processi post-bellici di crescita in un gran numero di paesi, tra i quali l'Italia» (De Cecco e Pedone 1995). The main variable is the ministerial civil service; the objective is to measure the growth of this part of public service in Italy during the expansion cycle in Fordism, with an approach that allow to highlight the unphysiologic growth, due to the political patronage - compared with the development cycle of industrial democracies - in the time of substitution of traditional bureaucracy with new industrial and social bureaucracy. By studying this variable and several controls, as demography, parliamentary majority and GPD, we exclude that the growth has been physiologic, and provide several alternative hypotheses for this result. © 2019 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

N2  - The term ``honorary citizenship{''} refers to historical homonyms-in the second half of the nineteenth century. This phrase has two meanings. One concerned the social status established in 1832, the second-the awards granted by the city councils in agreement with the emperor since the 1860s. The social status of honorary citizenship was a unique phenomenon and is more studied by historians. The award from the city council is a more universal phenomenon and exists till nowadays. The problem of honourable citizenship is not among the most important ones in the history, but it may be a kind of a showcase of the trends of the evolution of the urban society in late imperial Russia. The goal of this research is to analyze the award, which has not been in the focus of the historians. It reflects, on the one hand, the will of certain city dumas to pay tribute to one or another benefactor, on the other-the loyalty strategies and bureaucratic traditions that existed in the empire. The number of recipients in the entire empire reaches about 3000 people. During the study, the method of comparison and contextual analysis, as well as the method of typologies, was used. Case studies of honorary citizenship were considered in several cities of Ukraine under Russian rule-Kyiv, Katerynoslav, Sevastopol and Mykolaiv etc. Conclusions. All honorary citizens can be divided into three groups-bureaucracy (their award was a manifestation of just bureaucratic laws and loyalty strategies of city dumas; this category was the biggest one), benefactors (receiving them awards was already a manifestation of their strategies for building the image and the city's desire to express gratitude for patronage) and public figures. The prestige of the title was undeniable (that's why in reality many sought to get it), as well as the understanding of the urban elites of the need to focus on the central government. The author uses cases of Kyiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Sevastopol. Honorary citizenship in the cities of Ukraine in the imperial version lasted until 1917.

N2  - In the postwar era, Japan benefited from an unusually competent, public-minded, and powerful central bureaucracy that contributed to rapid economic growth, high education and health standards, domestic stability, and peaceful international relations. The regime combined democratic politics with strong administrative capacity and partial insulation from interest group pressures. Central ministry officials developed a compromise between autonomy and inclusion whereby they played a distinctively political role of arranging bargains among key interest groups. Yet the bureaucracy’s power and insulation also restricted the participation of civic groups and minority interests in the policy process, limited accountability to the broader public, and fostered collusive partnerships with politicians and favored interest groups. Bureaucratic dominance began to wane in the 1970s as politicians pushed beyond Ministry of Finance budget limits to expand the welfare state and boost public works spending for their constituents. Bureaucrats confronted even greater challenges in the 1990s, including a devastating financial crisis that abruptly ended the high-growth period, an electoral system reform that transformed political dynamics, and a gradual erosion of prestige. Meanwhile, political leaders enacted administrative reforms to strengthen their control over the bureaucracy and to centralize power in the Prime Minister’s Office and the cabinet. Nevertheless, Japan’s elite civil servants have preserved some core powers, including control over substantial elements of the policy process, the capacity to forge political bargains, and a knack for manipulating politicians to pursue their own policy preferences. © Oxford University Press 2022.

N2  - Significant variation in the institutions and efficiency of public bureaucracies across countries and regions are observed. These differences could be partially responsible for divergence in the effectiveness of policy implementation, corruption levels, and economic development. Do imperial legacies contribute to the observed variation in the organization of public administrations? Historical foreign rule and colonization have been shown to have lasting effects on legal systems, political institutions, and trade in former controlled territories. Imperial legacies could also explain variations in the performance of public administrations. The author uses the case of Poland to investigate the long-term effects of foreign rule on bureaucratic systems. Historically, Poland was split between three imperial powers with very different public administrations: Prussia, Austria, and Russia. Statistical analyses of original data collected through a survey of more than 650 Polish public administrations suggest that some present-day differences in the organization and efficiency of bureaucracies are due to imperial legacies.

N2  - Empirical analysis has lagged behind theoretical advancement in the study of legislative delegation of power to bureaucracies. This article analyzes why state legislatures delegated advisory and policy-forming powers to bureaucracies for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program from 1935 through 1996. The analysis supports various theories of bureaucratic discretion, while painting a complex political picture of delegation decisions. Legislators rely on bureaucrats to resolve uncertainty, especially when internal legislative information is scarce. Contrary to recent wisdom, however, delegation is not found to be associated with the general condition of unified government. Rather, delegation occurs under both divided and unified government, but the procedures chosen and appointment powers granted vary under these two conditions.

N2  - A common argument against privatization is that private providers will self-interestedly lobby to increase the size of their market. In this Article, I evaluate this argument, using, as a case study, the argument against prison privatization based on the possibility that the private prison industry will distort the criminal law by advocating for incarceration. I conclude that there is at present no particular reason to credit this argument. Even without privatization, actors in the public sector already lobby for changes in substantive law - in the prison context, for example, public corrections officer unions are active advocates of pro-incarceration policy. Against this background, adding the "extra voice" of the private sector will not necessarily increase either the amount of industry-increasing advocacy or its effectiveness. In fact, privatization may well reduce the industry's political power: Because advocacy is a "public good" for the industry, as the number of independent actors increases, the dominant actor's advocacy can decrease (since it no longer captures the full benefit of its advocacy) and the other actors may free ride off the dominant actor's contribution. Under some plausible assumptions, therefore, privatization may actually decrease advocacy. Under different plausible assumptions, the net effect of privatization on advocacy is ambiguous, but in any event, privatization does not unambiguously increase advocacy. The argument that privatization distorts policy by encouraging lobbying is thus unconvincing without a fuller explanation of the mechanics of advocacy.

N2  - The media have become such an indispensable part of modern democratic life that they often seem to dominate the political process. In 1997 Iyengar and Reeves published a book entitled Do the Media Govern? - and many observers would answer the question positively, pointing to numerous instances where media campaigns have put pressure on policymakers to revise their decisions. For example, when in summer 2006 the then British Home Secretary John Reid announced the government’s new ‘criminal justice package’ of longer sentences and more prison places, members of independent interest groups accused him of ‘letting tabloids dictate home affairs’ (Guardian 2006). Reid’s position appeared even more questionable since he had previously stated that prisons were not an effective instrument to combat crime. In the same year, a group of high-ranking former politicians and civil servants founded the Better Government Initiative that aims to develop proposals to improve the efficiency and transparency of British government institutions. According to this group, the media are one of the problems government is facing: The context within which Britain is governed has altered almost beyond recognition. The unavoidable pressures of round the clock press and television leave government less time to take coherent legislative and administrative decisions.

N2  - While not necessarily actual in the contemporary administrative divisions, vernacular regions are an integral part of regional identities. As such, they are a type of perceptual regions based solely on the inhabitants’ inner perception of a region. Vernacular regions are usually articulated through the occurrence of a region's name in various informal narratives such as labels of interest groups. The aim of the paper is to use the official online databases as a means to identify and extract interest groups such as businesses, companies and public associations with labels containing the name of Zagora region in southern Croatia. The extracted data is used to map the vernacular region and reach conclusions about the applicability of the method and the utilised data sources, as well as to find out how external perception influences regional affiliation in a traditional region without institutional frame.

N2  - Launching the rules for lobbying practice is mostly seen as a measurement for defining the ``playground{''} for lobbyist itself but moreover rules are a measure of curbing corruption potential. Both points of view could be described by the transparency idea. This paper tries to focus on regulation of the lobbied side of lobbying dealing - the post-separation employment measures, revolving doors, codes of conduct and other measures taken in order to improve transparency of decision-making and governance, integrity of lobbied public officials and indirectly to limit room for corruption.

N2  - The article analyses the political and legal phenomenon of lobbying, and corruption lobbying as its most destructive and dangerous deviance along with the negative consequences of the latter. Nowadays, lobbying in Russia remains unregulated, which causes problems in drawing a line between acceptable and unacceptable lobbying, and in preventing unacceptable lobbying. In order to prevent unacceptable and corruption lobbying, the author hypothesized that a system of permissive and prohibitive measures, with the focus on permissive measures, should be used. He proposes to define legislatively the concept ``lobbying{''}, to regulate acceptable and unacceptable methods of lobbying, to control the status of some persons, whose powers may be used in bad faith in lobbying. The author identifies the attributes of lobbying, and on the basis of these attributes formulates the concept ``lobbying{''}, which means a social and legal phenomenon, in which a person or entity uses certain methods to make an attempt to influence central or local authorities with the purpose of promoting or blocking certain law-making decisions. The following methods of lobbying are proposed as acceptable: citizen petition; information distribution in all media; independent anticorruption examination of legal acts and draft laws; research; social research and presentation of its results in order to influence certain law-making decisions. The following methods of lobbying are proposed as unacceptable: commission of offences and indecent acts in order to influence certain lawmaking decisions; formation of expert councils under the committees of legislative bodies from representatives of one interest group. The author also examines possible corruption risks associated with the activities of former public officials and proposes to suspend these persons from lobbying. The author notes the absence of rules controlling the unpaid advisors to the chairs of committees of the State Duma of the RF Federal Assembly and the possibility of an unfair use of these unpaid advisors' powers in lobbying. The issue of an unfair use of the powers of the chairs of committees of the State Duma is also considered.

N2  - This paper presents findings from interviews with US Research Integrity Officers (RIOs) on their overall responsibilities as well as perspectives on Data Management Plans (DMPs). DMPs are formal documents describing the roles and activities for managing data during and after research. DMPs are now a required research criterion by many funding agencies globally. A purposive sample of Research Integrity Officers (RIOs) from the top ten US private and public universities were recruited for interviews using an open-ended questionnaire related to their job duties and perspectives on data management plan implementation and evaluation. Responses from 12 participants were transcribed, anonymized, and coded in NVivo. RIO backgrounds, duties, and perspectives varied. The mode number of staff/ faculty people dedicated to the RIO role at these institutions was a halftime appointment. All RIOs had some responsibilities related to Authorship, Publication, and Inventorship and Integrity and Information with 11 participants also responsible for offering some Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training. Most RIOs assumed that Principle Investigators are responsible for DMP compliance during sponsored projects as well as the long-term data management after a project ends. None of the twelve participants has received any Research Data Management training. Given the sea change in research practices, RIOs should have more training as data-intensive research emerges and DMPs become commonplace. © 2021, Society of Research Administrators International.

N2  - The current global economic crisis has been disastrous for many millions of people. But it has also had the desirable effect of prompting a little more skepticism towards the economic beliefs that have constituted the mainstream view about public economic strategy for the past three decades, both in themajor western states and in international lending organizations like the World Bank and the IMF. They have at their core the proposition that 'government failure is generally worse than market failure', which supports the default policy setting of 'more free market' in most countries most of the time. The new crisis-induced skepticism is good news because the previous confidence rested more on what J. S. Mill called 'the deep slumber of a settled opinion' than on a solid empirical base. The present article begins by summarizing some powerful pieces of evidence that challenge core mainstream propositions in the context of developing countries, which have received less attention than they deserve. Having shown why the mainstream prescription for the role of government in development is questionable, the article describes some key points about the nature of industrial policy in East Asia and about the general rationale for a certain kind of industrial policy even where state capacity is relatively weak. The rationale is all the stronger in the world economy after the crisis, when a major surge of innovation around energy, water, nanotechnology and genetics is likely, rendering many existing specializations unviable. The article then presents an argument about the institutional arrangements of a 'developmental state' through which national strategies can be formed and implemented. It ends by describing small signs of new flexibility in World Bank and IMF thinking. Policy Implications: • Liberalizing markets, attracting FDI and promoting good governance are not necessary conditions of long-term economic growth and development in low-income countries. • In the wake of the global financial crisis and the impending surge of new technologies, the role of industrial policy - promoting some sectors or products ahead of others - should be expanded. • Import replacement as well as export orientation are crucial components of a successful industrial policy. • Four organizational features are important in a developmental state: (1) an even balance between the state and business groups; (2) a public service mindset among state officials; (3) delivery of patronage resources separately from the economic bureaucracy; and (4) an industrial extension service, with tight limits on its officials' discretionary control of resources. • Developing country governments and firms should be prepared to push back against the shrinking latitude for industrial policy instruments allowed in international trade and investment agreements.

N2  - The past few years have witnessed a wave of unrest in Egypt toppling down two regimes in less than three years. Yet was this sufficient to bringing the demanded change and meeting people’s expectations? In several Arab countries, citizens are offered patronage through public sector employment, subsidies, and limited taxation (Razzaz and Razzaz, 2012). The social contract imbalance offers little support to citizen voice and representation of all segments of society in holding governments accountable. Given the numerous challenges ranging from an overinflated bureaucracy resulting from the guaranteed employment since Nasser’s era, to the declining quality of the available pool of workers and to regulations that hinder its development, capacity building of would pose as one of the least costly areas of potential quick reform (Beissinger et al, 2013; El Baradei and Newcomer, 2008; ETF, 2011; Radwan, 2012; World Bank, 2013). Public management literature implies that a political will and government-endorsed reforms tend to have a higher rate of success (Meyer-Sahling 2011; Nakroŝis, 2014). This reflects on the organizational willingness and commitment to training and training transfer (Lim and Morris, 2006; Nakroŝis, 2014). Based on previous research in the field that links institutional enabling factors and a committed political will to effective capacity building (Adetunji, 2012; Lim and Morris, 2006; Majeed, 2010; Meyer-Sahling 2011; Nakroŝis, 2014; Newcomer et al., 2010; OECD, 1997, Rondineli, 2004) this research will examine the institutional challenges to capacity building in Egypt post the Arab Spring. The methodology utilized depends on a literature review of primary and secondary sources for grounded theory qualitative research on capacity building and institutional enabling factors. The findings are linked to a qualitative analysis to probe the perceptions of public service mid-career managerial level professionals and to identify their perceived expectations of whether training institutions would be effective in transforming public service. Managerial levels were selected to enable probing the commitment of institutions. Two empirical tools were utilized: interviews and surveys. The first tool was a number of in-depth face-to-face structured interviews conducted with 24 informed sources representing senior managerial level public service managers. The second tool was a survey which was distributed both online and in hard copy. The survey targeted a purposive sample of 350 mid-managerial level public service managers of which 324 were received. Thus, exceeding the critical sample size of 200 identified by Joseph Hair and his colleagues (1998) in deciding about the sufficient sample size for empirical research. Data collection took a total of seven months, from June to December 2013, and was approved by the American University in Cairo Institutional Review Board.

N2  - Introduction: Citizens, Informality and Urban Governance Citizens occupy an uneasy position in the major theories of urban governance and democracy, among them pluralism, elite theory and regime theory. Urban politics, at least in these three theories, is the domain of big actors and big institutions: politicians, bureaucrats, large administrative agencies, behind-the-scenes business elites, developers and construction companies, housing corporations, and pressure groups of all stripes. The one constant in this pluralist give and take is that urban policy pays heed to the requirements of a favourable business climate and, following currently popular neoliberal claims of irresistible pressures for change, to globalization and the escalating competition between 'global cities' (Lindblom 1977; Judge 1995, 28; Dryzek, 1996; Sassen 2001; Fainstein 2010). In this hard-nosed game there is hardly any room for the influence of citizens. They either sporadically combine in associations to exert pressure on specific issues or are largely indifferent to politics (Harding 1995, 43). Citizens do play a central role in another chapter of urban theory: the informal city. Informality is a key concept in theories of planning that concern themselves with urbanization. Informality refers to 'informal modes of organizing space, livelihood and citizenship' (Roy 2010). It is usually associated with hyper-urbanization in the Global South, and it has been most extensively studied in these contexts (Roy 2003; Corbridge et al. 2005; Simone and Abouhani 2005; Chatterjee 2006; Holston 2008). In the absence of state institutions that are sufficiently strong to provide essential services to the poor, the latter have to rely on their own practical skills to create such services. Born of necessity, informality also contains hope however. Informality becomes the expression of another kind of urban politics, a 'deep democracy', a 'countergovernmentality' (Chatterjee 2006) that, informed by local knowledge of the conditions and experiences of the poor, allows them to construct an alternative 'insurgent' citizenship that destabilizes 'entrenched' forms of citizenship (Holston, 2008). © Cambridge University Press 2014.

N2  - The government of Bangladesh has introduced several initiatives seeking to develop participatory governance at the local level in order to maximise the outcomes of aid-assisted development projects. This article examines the impact of these initiatives and demonstrates that participatory local governance faces a number of challenges in Bangladesh, in particular, absence of democratic culture and tradition and disengagement of citizens, asymmetric distribution of patronage and weak institutions. In theory, political elites and bureaucrats in Bangladesh advocate democracy, accountability and local-level participation, but in practice, they have an affinity for power and centralised authority. Their reform initiatives seem half-hearted and disjointed restricting the growth of democratic culture and participatory local governance at the local level in Bangladesh.

N2  - Originally published in 1968, this book deals with the process of public legislation in modern Britain at the time, not in terms of constitutional formulae, but by a realistic appraisal of the relationships between the political institutions and forces which gave the process its shape. It concentrates particularly on the procedures and conventions which operated at the preparatory stages of legislation, and established that legislation was almost exclusively a governmental function, Parliament playing only a minor role. It is particularly concerned to stress the extent to which consultation by the government with pressure groups was now a major feature of the legislative process, and concludes that subordinate departmental legislation, developed as a result of collaboration between pressure groups and Civil Servants, was the most characteristic and important stage of the legislative process in Britain. The book brought together the conclusions of recent scholarship in this field, and the result is a balanced perspective of an important decision-making process of British government at the time. Today it can be read in its historical context. © 1968 George Allen & Unwin Ltd.

N2  - The European Commission is trying to salvage the basic terms of a passenger data-sharing agreement with the US to avoid new negotiations. A bridging mechanism is required to continue the flow of information and unimpeded transatlantic airline operations, before final resolution can be found. The European Court of Justice upheld a European Parliament claim that the deal was negotiated improperly and that the legal argument underpinning the EC-brocered pact was flawed. The court has allowed the current provisions to remain in force until the end of September 2006, with the US and European Union government officials both noting that this this will provide time to craft a new arrangement. Airline advocacy groups on both sides of the Atlantic are urging a quick solution.

N2  - The universal nature of conscription ties or anchors broad segments of society to the military. What happens to societal anchoring after the draft ends? Using in-depth interviews with two groups of elites, this article explores factors that promote and hinder the Swedish Military's societal anchoring post-conscription. The first group consisted of 18 executives at the Swedish Armed Forces (SAF) headquarters with strategic positions in relation to societal anchoring. The second group consisted of 15 representatives from the corresponding political level: members of the parliamentary Committee on Defense and their officials. The interviews were semistructured and analyzed according to a grounded theory-inspired approach. Main themes concerning obstacles were the public's low interest and dated knowledge, an unclear political debate resulting in vague expectations concerning the SAF, as well as unclear responsibility for informing the public, and confidence gaps between the military and the political elite.

N2  - This article examines the Irish fiscal-military state in the eighteenth century. It locates the Irish state within a broader imperial context showing how Ireland contributed to the wider British imperial project. In particular, this article looks at the development of an efficient tax-gathering apparatus, showing how the revenue board, the most pervasive agency of the eighteenth-century Irish state, extracted increasing levels of taxation from a sometimes hostile population. Drawing extensively on the records of the Irish revenue commissioners, a very rich if under utilized source, it demonstrates for the first time the levels of taxation raised in Ireland, while also exploring how these taxes were collected. It concludes that this period saw the expansion of an increasingly professional bureaucracy, challenging existing interpretations that have focused predominantly on politicization. The final section looks at issues of evasion and compliance, showing the difficulties faced by the Irish state in this period, as it expanded deeper into Irish society.

N2  - The performance of public services is now more closely scrutinised than ever before. In the current age of hyper-accountability – what Michael Power (1999) memorably termed the ‘audit society’ – every teacher, doctor, social worker or probation officer knows that behind them stands a restless army of overseers, equipped with a panoply of league tables, star ratings, user opinion surveys, performance indicators and the like with which to judge them. It can seem to these public servants as if regulators, inspectors, government, politicians, the media, pressure groups and assertive service users line up to berate them for their shortcomings, criticise their failings and make ever more challenging demands on their services. Those who lead public organisations – chief executives, head teachers, directors and others – may with reason feel acutely vulnerable and personally exposed to the risks of any failure, whatever its cause, within their organisation. The era of passive, compliant, respectful and grateful public service users; authoritative, distant and unchallengeable professionals; and comfortable, complacent, conservative and unchanging public bureaucracies is long gone. Those who feel a tinge of nostalgic warmth for times past should remind themselves that, rather than this being a halcyon age for public services, it was a time when mediocrity and incompetence were tolerated or ignored in public services, when poor standards or inadequate performance often persisted for years, and when a ‘club culture’ evolved in which public services often seemed to be organised to benefit their staff, not their users or the public (Kennedy 2001). © Cambridge University Press 2010.

N2  - The paper questions from an Austrian perspective the hypotheses that enjoy widespread support in mainstream economics that business groups are a symptom of imperfect competition and a threat to competition with negative impacts on social welfare. For this, an Austrian theoretical framework is developed and then applied to analyze the interaction of competition and business groups regarding the case of "agroholdings" in Russia. It is maintained that the orthodox literature does not adequately account for the characteristic features of competition in the real world, and therefore may lead to wrong normative conclusions on the relation between business groups and competition. It is argued that also in transition economies for competition to function as an entrepreneurial discovery process, no perfect markets are needed but only freedom to entry and property rights security. Then there is no pattern of action, which in and of itself is inconsistent with competition. Therefore, unless there is evidence for government support, business groups must principally be seen as the result of competitive entrepreneurial discoveries. It is further argued that the only real danger of business groups for competition does not come from their ability to raise non-legal barriers to entry, but from government protection. This may either result from successful lobbying of business groups or from the preference of government officials for this particular form of business organization. Case studies evidence from business groups in Russia's agro-food sector illustrates these arguments.

N2  - This study combines resource-based view and institutional theory to clarify the relationship between corporate political strategy and performance in transition China. We analyze the hypothesis using a multiple regression analysis approach, and 198 Chinese private firms are selected as the samples. The results conclude that: (1) Corporate political strategy will significantly impact on firm performance; (2) Financial incentive strategy, information strategy, lobbying strategy and political support strategy will significantly impact on firm performance; (3) Top management orientation moderates the relationship between corporate political strategy and firm performance; (4) Social capital developed from government officials moderates the relationship between corporate political strategy and firm performance. We explore the implications of these results for future research and practicing managers.

N2  - This study identifies the critical role of guanxi with government officials in helping firms gain favorable policy support and shape positive competition environment in transition China. We postulate that the positive relationship between guanxi with government officials and organizational performance is mediated by lobbying. In a sample of 127 Chinese private firms, we find that guanxi with government officials is positively related to lobbying, which is positively related to organizational performance. Finally, implications for researchers and practitioners are presented. ©

N2  - This article presents a qualitative empirical study of the impact of corruption and anti-corruption on the efficiency of China's bureaucratic system in developing a local economy. Drawing on 40 in-depth interviews and 98 days of participant observation, it first investigates the significance of extravagant position-related consumption in building personalized bureaucratic ties (patronage networks) and mobilizing resources for local economic development. It then examines the causal link between President Xi's campaign against corruption and extravagance and the rise of bureaucratic slack in local governments. The anti-extravagance campaign reduces the level of corruption in local government but it discourages local officials, who are motivated primarily by the desire to avoid risk and ensure political survival, from using banquets and gift-giving to build patronage networks, attract investment and mobilize development resources. The article concludes that corruption may contribute positively to the efficiency of a fragmented Chinese bureaucracy in fostering development at the local level, while the anti-corruption campaign compels local cadres to develop a new coping strategy - bureaucratic slack - for implementing policies and developing local economies.

N2  - Existing studies of state-led industrial development argue that state autonomy is essential for formulating consistent and coherent industrial policies. This article shows that autonomous bureaucracy, while useful for fending off the politics of interest groups, is not free of politics in itself. Using Chinese industrial policy-making as a strategic case study, this article uncovers the competitive dimension of bureaucratic decision-making and the extent to which it serves as a driving force for industrial policy paradigm change in China. Equipped with a theory of policy articulation, this article details the strategies used by multiple superagencies and groups of career bureaucrats to vie for industrial policy authority within the Chinese state. In sum, this article seeks to expose the role of intrabureaucracy competition in mediating international political economic environment and national policy outcomes. Looking forward, this article proposes that the renewed focus on industrial policy by many national governments compels an analytical re-engagement with the role of large bureaucracies in economic decision-making and the kind of organizational and cognitive frameworks by which bureaucrats mobilize to chart our industrial landscapes.

N2  - Background: Properly implemented evidence-based clinical and public health guidelines can improve patient outcomes. WHO has been a major contributor to guideline development, publishing more than 250 guidelines on various topics since 2008. However, well-developed guidelines can only be effective if they are adequately and appropriately implemented. Herein, we aimed to explore whether and how WHO guidelines are implemented in local contexts to inform the success of future guideline implementation. Methods: Seventeen interviews were carried out between March 2018 and December 2018 with WHO guideline developers, headquarter staff, and regional and country office staff. Participants were purposely sampled from a variety of WHO guidelines and snowball sampling was used to identify regional and country office staff. The deidentified transcripts were analysed through three phases of coding, using grounded theory as the analytic approach. Results: WHO guidelines played a variety of roles in the work of WHO at all levels. WHO officers and local government officials used WHO guidelines to influence health policy. We categorised the uses of guidelines as (1) directly changing policy, (2) justifying policy change, (3) engaging stakeholders, (4) being guarantors of legitimacy, (5) being advocacy tools, and (6) intertwining with WHO's various roles. Participants refuted the perception of the guidelines as mere lists of technical recommendations that needed to be implemented in different contexts. We found that the existence, quality and credibility, rather than the content of the guidelines, are the keys to health policy change initiatives in different local contexts. Conclusions: Used as a guarantor of legitimacy by policy-makers, WHO guidelines can be better positioned to influence health policy and practice change. Understanding the various roles of guidelines can help WHO developers package guidelines to optimise their effective implementation.

N2  - This paper is primarily concerned with development of data protection legislation in the United Kingdom from the late 1960s through to the enactment of the 1984 Data Protection Act. Following a series of private members' bills calling for varying degrees of privacy legislation, the UK government commissioned two significant reports in the 1970s. The first, the Younger Report on Privacy (1972), established 10 principles for the handling of personal data that were to influence data protection statutes in Europe. The Lindop Report on Data Protection (1978) examined public- and private-sector computer systems, recommending a flexible legislative environment - with a set of broad principles guiding a data protection authority in its development of codes of practice aimed at various sectors of the economy. The far-reaching nature of those recommendations can now be appreciated in the work of the modern Information Commissioner's Office, 25 years after the publication of the Lindop Report. However, the momentum created by the two studies faded during the period 1979 82. Labour and Conservative governments respectively consulted further and objected to additional bureaucracy involved in creating a data protection authority. During this period of entropy, unpublished memoranda and correspondence demonstrated how former members of the Lindop Committee maintained the pressure on government, ensuring that their work was not forgotten. Eventually, overseas legislation and the need for the UK to maintain its position at the 'crossroads of the information highway' ensured that the UK, albeit grudgingly, enacted a Data Protection Act in 1984. By that time, the UK had lost the lead in defining data protection law and policy established by the Reports of Younger and Lindop. In highlighting findings from the Committees and efforts by dedicated individuals in lobbying successive governments in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the authors demonstrate the importance of preserving historical memory. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

N2  - Democratic theorists commonly distinguish between direct democracy and representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens rule themselves, while in a representative democracy they elect representatives to rule on their behalf. Today s democracies are all representative in structure-a form dictated by scale and complexity-with some direct elements such as initiatives and referendums, as well as some forms of citizen engagement. The concept of participatory democracy usually refers to these latter two elements: Direct decision-making as well as citizen involvement in decisionmaking within representative structures. If, however, we consider these two forms of participation from the perspective of representation, the first involves citizen participation in government or other formalized decisionmaking, on the assumption that citizens represent themselves within these processes. The second involves citizens themselves serving in representative capacities: lay citizens represent other citizens. I shall refer to these roles as citizen representatives-a form of representation that is increasingly common in practice, but almost untheorized in democratic theory. To be sure, the idea that citizens are best represented by other lay citizens serving as representatives is an old democratic ideal. It justified early notions that elected representatives should be salaried so as to enable ordinary citizens-not just the rich-to serve in public office, as well as the more recent idea that term limits will prevent elected representatives from becoming professional political elites. These and other devices are based on the presumption that when citizens represent other citizens, the representative relationship is secured through common experience. The presumption is not a good one, however. Common experience usually gives way to the realities of running for and holding office, which subject lay citizens and professional politicians alike to the same constraints of campaigning, brokering, and responding to interest group pressures, and lead to very similar behaviors (Fisher and Herrick 2003). Moreover, as Max Weber noted almost a century ago, governing complex societies provides little room for amateurs and dilettantes, who are at best ineffective and at worst more easily manipulated by interest groups and bureaucrats than are professional politicians. Over the last few decades, however, new forms of citizen representation have been rapidly evolving (Fiorino 1990; Rowe and Frewer 2000; Warren 2003; Brown 2006). These forms involve nonprofessionals who are selected or self-selected, rather than elected, for representative purposes. The oldest form of citizen representative is the legal jury, which represents the considered judgment of peers within courtroom proceedings (Dzur 2012). We can now add to this limited form more recent experiments with citizen juries and panels, advisory councils, stakeholder meetings, lay members of professional review boards, representations at public hearings, public submissions, citizen surveys, deliberative polling, deliberative forums, focus groups, and advocacy group representations (Fung 2006b; Fiorino 1990; Rowe and Frewer 2000). Citizen representatives typically function not as alternatives but rather as supplements to elected representative bodies or administrative bodies in areas of weakness, usually having to do with limitations of communication, deliberation, legitimacy, governability, or attentiveness to public norms and common goods (Brown 2006; Warren 2009). Although it has been common to refer these forms of political activity under the category of "participatory democracy" or (more recently) "participatory governance," the term fails to identify what is perhaps their most important feature: Each involves a form of representation that depends upon the active participation of a relatively few citizens who function as representatives of other citizens. Thus, whereas the notion of participatory democracy suggests that most citizens participate in self-rule-a worthy ideal-what is most important about these new forms is their representative qualities. Accordingly, they should not be measured by how many citizens are enabled to participate through these forms (although this remains a valid measure of democracy), but rather by the nature and quality of democratic representation achieved through these forms. Theories of participatory democracy are not equipped to guide these judgments (Urbinati 2006). This theoretical deficit is highlighted by the case of the British Columbia Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (CA), a remarkable political experience convened in British Columbia, Canada, in 2004, precisely because it was constructed as a body of nonprofessional citizens who would represent other citizens in the fundamental constitutional matter of assessing and designing an electoral system. In this chapter, I address this theoretical gap first by highlighting deficits in democratic representation through elected legislative bodies. Second, I suggest that strategies for increasing citizen participation often frame the democratic deficit problem in ways that are unlikely to be successful. At the same time, the lens of participatory democracy tends to obscure the increasingly important concept of representative relationships among citizens-usually, between the active few and the passive many. Third, if we approach citizen-based political venues through the framework of representation, we can ask about how well emerging forms of citizen participation measure up as citizen representatives: Who authorizes citizen representatives? How egalitarian are their effects? How are they held accountable? Using these criteria, I assess the CA model as a citizen representative body. Considered as a representative body, the CA shows strengths in areas where both elected legislatures and other kinds of citizen representative bodies tend to be weak. Finally, I conclude that, owing to certain weaknesses of CA-style citizen representative bodies-particularly with respect to accountability to constituencies-they should be viewed as supplements to, rather than replacements for, other forms of representation (Lang and Warren 2012).

N2  - Objectives: While there is great deal of scholarship on the nature of presidential appointments in the realm of domestic policy (e.g., cabinet departments and regulatory agencies), foreign policy appointments have received far less attention. Yet, these appointments are important because they have global implications, dealing with such basic issues as trade, diplomacy, war, and peace. We examine one type of foreign policy appointment, the ambassadorial appointments of Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Methods: We employ data provided by the U.S. Department of State and data collected from various sources on the background characteristics of their U.S. ambassadors. Results: We find that while both presidents promoted loyalty over competence in their ambassadorial appointments, they did so in different ways. The first President Bush used a personal "friends and neighbors" approach, while Clinton rewarded former campaign officials. Though it generally is assumed that presidents reward key contributors from their presidential campaign with key assignments, we find that Clinton was more likely than Bush to reward contributors with appointments to choice countries. Finally, we demonstrate that women and minorities received appointments of lesser quality during the Bush administration. Conclusions: The determinants of ambassadorial appointments are more complex than previously assumed. While presidents appoint ambassadors on the basis of campaign contributions, they do not reward them equally with plum assignments.

the Czechoslovak state had to appear before local loyalty commissions to
prove their loyalty to the Hungarian state. The commissions' task was
complicated by two competing conceptions of loyalty - one investigating
civic loyalty, the other national loyalty - and the politicisation and

N2  - Corrupt government hiring is common in developing countries. This paper
uses original data to document the operation and consequences of corrupt
hiring in a health bureaucracy. Hires pay bribes averaging 17 months of
salary, but contrary to conventional wisdom, their observable quality is
comparable to counterfactual merit-based hires. Exploiting variation
across jobs, I show that the consequences of corrupt allocations depend
on the correlation between wealth and quality among applicants: service
delivery outcomes are good for jobs where this was positive and poor
when negative. In this setting, the correlation was typically positive,
leading to relatively good performance of hires.

N2  - In recent years, commentators have complained about what they regard as an increasingly dysfunctional confirmation process for judges and high-ranking executive officials, and the proper role for the Senate in the confirmation process has been much debated. This Article suggests that confirmations have been contentious throughout American history, and that the focus on ideological issues in today's confirmation proceedings is not anomalous. Indeed, historically, both Republicans and Democrats have used the confirmation process to delay or oppose nominations when the President hails from a different political party, and, sometimes, even when the President comes from the same party but there are ideological objections to the nominee. That the appointments process has, at times, been difficult and contentious should come as no great surprise. The Framers of the United States Constitution intentionally created a governmental structure that was more prone to obstructionism than other comparable systems. Relying on concepts like ``separation of powers,{''} and ``checks and balances,{''} the Framers sought to constrain the federal government in ways that would limit the possibilities for governmental abuse. The appointments power reflects this approach. Like many other constitutional powers, it is a shared power. Although the President has the power to nominate Article III judges, as well as ambassadors and ``officers,{''} nominees can only be confirmed with the ``advice and consent{''} of the Senate. By placing the power to appoint in two politically elected entities, the Constitution establishes a system whereby political influences will sometimes have a major impact on the confirmation process. Although contentiousness can arise during any type of nomination, some Supreme Court nominations have been particularly bitter. Both the Senate and the American public have increasingly become aware that the courts make law and that the political and judicial attitudes of nominees matter. Under such circumstances, the Senate's inquiry quite naturally goes beyond the simple question of whether a nominee is qualified or unqualified. However, the confirmation process is more difficult,today, even for nonjudicial nominees, because of the bitter partisanship that has infected the U.S. political system.

N2  - The rise of ‘ecological consciousness’ from the late 1970s onwards has complicated the already hugely contentious field of development policy and studies by adding a reflectivist dynamic, which seems impossible to avoid (see, for example, Beck 1992, 2009; Beck et al. 1994). In this chapter, I want to trace broadly why environmental questions are today central to development debates, and what this means for political debates over the future of our contemporary civilizations. The chapter begins with an outline of the reflectivist challenge posed by ecological concerns, and provides a basic account of the contradictions this raises for development policy and analysis. This is followed by a discussion of some case examples, which help to highlight central problems in the environment/development debate. In the third part, I step sideways to take a look at some of the reasons why the debates take on the forms they have, and investigate the intellectual, practical and political conditions that sustain things in this way. The final part concludes by drawing out three broad ideas central to reconciling environmental and developmental concerns. Before proceeding, I want to put a few preliminaries in place, which will help to scope and evaluate the exposition below. In developing the observations and points that follow, I won’t be able provide any arguments regarding some rather large issues. For example, whether anthropogenic climate change is or is not ‘happening’ is one of the questions that has-rightly or wronglyoccupied most of the headline news on environmental concerns, and has underpinned much political work in multilateral forums. (Think, for instance, of the importance assigned to the allocation of, and trade in, emission permits; see United Nations 1998; HM Treasury 2006). Beneath such pre-eminent, global concerns, others occasionally gain public exposure, such as the problems of ‘food security’, the provision of drinking water, disease control, deforestation and desertification, the integrity of oceanic ecosystems, and waste management; all are intermittently prominent concerns in debates involving scientists, interest groups, governments, bureaucracies, businesses and laypersons. For the purpose of the discussion that follows, I want to move away from one aspect of these discourses that has been fairly pervasive, namely the tendency to treat the issues in question in terms of an either/or logic. On such a reading, for instance, either climate change is (significantly) down to the active transformation of ecological conditions through human activity, or it is a coincidental occurrence, contingent upon cosmic or geological cycles and their implications, but beyond (decisive) human influence. The general expectation is that either of these two positions will eventually be validated on the strength of evidence produced through scientific research. In the meantime, politics revolves around people throwing their lot behind either one of the two approaches, sometimes out of conviction, but more often than not out of selfinterested motives. Once the truth about climate change is established, the condition of uncertainty that feeds the political debates will be removed, and social and political organization be conducted in the light of the new scientfic consensus. This strikes me as unhelpful for the question of how environmental and developmental imperatives may or may not contradict one another, what to do about it, and how to construct an analysis for such purposes. While the question of human agency in climate change is eminently important, for example, for considering some really rather tough questions about justice, both intergenerational and intercultural, the effects of alterations in climatic conditions require responses, whether these particular justice dimensions can be explicated with the help of scientific consensus or not: some of the Pacific Islands, which are threatened by rising sea levels, for example, are home to populations for whom assistance will be essential, whatever the expediencies of the ‘blame’ question might be (COP15 2009). For the purpose of this chapter, I will then assume that the main challenges posed by the ecological question for thinking about development are social and political, rather than about scientific validation, and epistemological arguments over what sorts of criteria should count in the latter. Lest I be misunderstood in this move, this is not to suggest that the debates about the science of climate change and about the ethics of responsibility and guilt are not important and worthwhile; instead, I want to suggest that a rather large part of why environmental questions have the effect of complicating and altering the ‘development’ narrative retains its plausibility and importance irrespective of settling on the science of either climate change, or any of the other constellations alluded to above. As we will see below, the paradoxes posed by considering developmental and environmental imperatives next to one another occur in a variety of contexts with discernible impacts, and are therefore already a persistent part of what people have to negotiate in their day-to-day lives around the world (Bass et al. 2005). Having said this, I should also point out that a constitutive assumption I do make for the purpose of this chapter is that human societies in general do have the proven capacity to alter their natural environment in ways that are potentially, and frequently were, actually detrimental to their ‘interests’. Overexploitation of natural resources has been a frequent contributory cause for the collapse of civilizations, not to speak of smaller communities (indicatively, see Diamond 2006). Once we step inside human history for orienting our frame of reference, we will thus find ample reason for proceeding very carefully with claims regarding links between ‘know-how’ and technology, and ecological sustainability.1.

N2  - Building on the seminal contributions by Pigou (1920), Coase (1960) and Baumol and Oates (1971), economists have extensively explored the role that economic incentives might play in bringing a more efficient allocation of natural resources. The theory of environmental economics suggests that pricing instruments are an adequate means to internalize external costs. More specifically, there is widespread agreement within the scientific community that from a theoretical point of view pricing instruments are preferable to alternative measures, owing to their efficiency advantages (Frey et al., 1985). However, though economists see pricing instruments as an attractive policy tool, most attempts to introduce economic incentives in environmental policy have failed, and the acceptance of these mechanisms in the political debate is still rather limited (Hahn, 1989; Schneider and Weck-Hannemann, 2005). There are many possible reasons why incentive instruments as a means to internalize external costs have been rarely applied in the past. It certainly would be too simple just to refer to imperfect information on the part of decision-makers about the advantages of incentive-based instruments. On the contrary, there seem to be good reasons why politicians, voters, bureaucrats, and/or representatives of interest groups are rather reluctant to favor price instruments on a large scale in environmental politics. © 2008 Springer-Verlag US.

N2  - The dominant theory of elite power, grounded in Weberian bureaucracy, has analyzed elites in terms of stable positions at the top of enduring institutions. Today, many conditions that spawned these stable ‘command posts’ no longer prevail, and elite power thus warrants rethinking. This article advances an argument about contemporary ‘influence elites’. The way they are organized and the modus operandi they employ to wield influence enable them to evade public accountability, a hallmark of a democratic society. Three cases are presented, first to investigate changes in how elites operate and, second, to examine varying configurations in which the new elites are organized. The cases demonstrate that influence elites intermesh hierarchies and networks, serve as connectors, and coordinate influence from multiple, moving perches, inside and outside official structures. Their flexible and multi-positioned organizing modes call for reconsidering elite theory and grappling with the implications of these elites for democratic society.

N2  - Here, more than 100 years of incumbency reports on officers of the irrigation bureaucracy of Punjab, Pakistan, are presented and analyzed. The data highlight how representation changed before and after partition within the irrigation bureaucracy. The data show that the irrigation bureaucracy increased through staffing its representation of local communities and is in its appointments responsive to elected representatives. Therefore, it is argued that empowerment of the local community can be achieved without irrigation management transfer but through the irrigation bureaucracy itself.

N2  - Despite abundant evidence regarding the influence of US state-imposed tax and expenditure limitations on local governments, the causes and consequences of local overrides remain largely unexplored. This article comprehensively examines the fiscal effects of local overrides of Massachusetts’s state-enforced property tax limit. Existing evidence has shown that pressure from powerful local interest groups, such as public schoolteachers and public employees, is crucial for determining agenda-setting and the successes or failures of measures overriding the statewide property tax limit. In that sense, fiscal constraints are able to curb bureaucrats’ budget-maximizing behaviors. Empirically, a regression discontinuity design estimation shows that local property tax limit overrides increase local property taxes and total revenues, decentralize the state–local fiscal relationship, and improve local budgetary balance. However, overrides do not affect local government spending.

N2  - After years spent trying, and failing, to prevent paediatric tobacco use in the face of an industry that was spending billions of dollars to promote its products, public policy emerged as an alternative tool for changing attitudes to tobacco. Shaping public policy decisions requires skills which can be taught and learned. First, it is important to identify the level of government to be influenced. The four main targets are elected federal, state, or local government officials, and non-elected administrative rule makers at all levels; in general, the further away and the higher the level, the harder they are to influence. Many people find it difficult to make a substantial difference at the federal level but their ability increases dramatically with state government. City or county officials are the most accessible level of government and are the easiest for a genuine grass roots effect. To initiate policy change, it is necessary to select activities that will attract support (e.g. reducing children's access to tobacco, restricting tobacco advertising, promoting clean air), to gather likely allies from the community (e.g. medical associations, volunteer health organizations, parent-teacher-student associations) and to approach sympathetic legislators, representatives and officials. It is equally important to know the extent of the opposition and, in particular, the tactics of the tobacco industry. However, times have changed, and where once policy makers only heard from tobacco industry lobbyists they now have constituents asking questions about their voting record on matters that affect us all.

N2  - So far, bureaucratic apparatuses have been important for the analysis of both dictatorial regimes and democracies characterized by a weak political party structure like the United States. This article will elucidate the political system of the Federal Republic of Germany, especially the so-called ``System Kohl{''}, by making use of Max Weber's type of administrative apparatus. I argue, that highly organized state bureaucracies and mass parties embedded in a parliamentary system do not necessarily provide effective control against the arbitrary use of power by the chancellor and party leader. Rather, they tend to establish a two-track system: while the regular organisation takes care of routine political business, decision-making shifts to informal circles shaped and dominated by a single person and maintained by the personal will for power. The analysis shows that key components of the ``Kohl System{''} include party adherence, as a means of political leverage, the cult of personality, cronyism, patronage, and back door funding ({''}Bimbes{''}).

N2  - The Europeanisation of collective action highlights the emergence of "bottom-up" mobilisations around the European Union. The organisations which are increasingly involved on a community scale notably include "public interest" groups. The European structuring of the associative sector is analysed here from the point of view of two competing networks which are aiming to be the official mouthpiece : the Comité européen des associations d'intérê t général (CEDAG) and European Citizens' Action Service (ECAS). Through the strategies of these two organisations, essentially focused on the generation of expertise, two visions of the relations between associations and public authorities in the Community are in fact being generated, the former being closer to the neo-corporatist paradigm of mediation of social interests and the latter more in accordance with the pluralist paradigm.

N2  - Background: In successfully negotiating the Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control (FCTC), the World Health Organization (WHO) has led a
significant innovation in global health governance, helping to transform
international tobacco control. This article provides the first
comprehensive review of the diverse campaign initiated by transnational
tobacco corporations (TTCs) to try to undermine the proposed convention.
Methods and Findings: The article is primarily based on an analysis of
internal tobacco industry documents made public through litigation,
triangulated with data from official documentation relating to the FCTC
process and websites of relevant organisations. It is also informed by a
comprehensive review of previous studies concerning tobacco industry
efforts to influence the FCTC. The findings demonstrate that the
industry's strategic response to the proposed WHO convention was
two-fold. First, arguments and frames were developed to challenge the
FCTC, including: claiming there would be damaging economic consequences;
depicting tobacco control as an agenda promoted by high-income
countries; alleging the treaty conflicted with trade agreements, ``good
governance,'' and national sovereignty; questioning WHO's mandate;
claiming the FCTC would set a precedent for issues beyond tobacco; and
presenting corporate social responsibility (CSR) as an alternative.
Second, multiple tactics were employed to promote and increase the
impact of these arguments, including: directly targeting FCTC
delegations and relevant political actors, enlisting diverse allies
(e.g., mass media outlets and scientists), and using stakeholder
consultation to delay decisions and secure industry participation.
Conclusions: TTCs' efforts to undermine the FCTC were comprehensive,
demonstrating the global application of tactics that TTCs have
previously been found to have employed nationally and further included
arguments against the FCTC as a key initiative in global health
governance. Awareness of these strategies can help guard against
industry efforts to disrupt the implementation of the FCTC and support
the development of future, comparable initiatives in global health.

N2  - The forced mid-term resignations of nine U.S. Attorneys was an unprecedented event in American history. Nearly one year after the administration executed the removals, the House Judiciary Committee was still reviewing and publicizing emails, memoranda, and other documents in an effort to understand how, the firings were effectuated. This Note examines many of those documents and concludes that the removals were likely carried out for partisan reasons. It then draws on the Constitution, Supreme Court precedent, and separation of powers principles to argue that Congress is constitutionally empowered to enact removal limitations for inferior officers such as U.S. Attorneys so long as those limitations do not impermissibly infringe on the president's Article II authority or result in congressional aggrandizement. Because of the partisan nature of the attorneys' removals, this Note argues that Congress should consider such legislation to limit the president's removal of U.S. Attorneys. In considering the constitutionality and efficacy of a potential statute, this Note examines three previous pieces of legislation on which such removal limitations could be modeled before proposing a fourth, hybrid statute that would emphasize the separation of powers values of balance and accountability in barring ``partisan{''} removals of U.S. Attorneys. The Note concludes by claiming that the framework that the Supreme Court created ill McDonnell Douglas v. Green can supply a useful analog to manage the fact-intensive probe into whether a removal was impermissibly ``partisan{''} under the proposed statute or merely a typical, ``political{''} removal, which any removal statute must likely allow to meet constitutional muster

N2  - There has recently been a series of challenges to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ({''}SEC{''}) use of Administrative Law Judges ({''}ALJs{''}) to preside over enforcement actions. In one of those challenges, Hill v. SEC, Judge Leigh Martin May of the Northern District of Georgia ruled that SEC ALA are inferior officers of the United States, and therefore their appointments must comply with the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which they currently do not. The Eleventh Circuit reversed, ruling that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the challenge. This Essay compares the district and appellate decisions, ultimately agreeing with Judge May's conclusions. The court of appeals failed to recognize that precluding collateral challenges to ALJ appointments renders most plaintiffs unable to ever challenge the appointments process, as their challenge will be moot by the time direct judicial review is available. However, some plaintiffs' cases may be saved by the ``capable of repetition yet evading review{''} exception. If that occurs, and a plaintiff is heard on the merits of an Appointments Clause challenge, the entire administrative adjudicative system could come crashing down. Therefore, Congress should amend the ALJ appointments process to cure the constitutional defect.

N2  - Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan asked the Michigan state government for small group market rate reform already adopted in most other states. Officials responded with major restructuring proposals aimed specifically at the Blues. The Michigan Blues fought back with a massive lobbying campaign as vigorous as any mounted by opponents of health reform at the national level. The company was able to prevail over one of the most powerful governors in Michigan history, whose party controlled both houses of the legislature. This amazing political victory shared much in common with the Clinton health reform's defeat by the industry and the more recent success of the prescription drug industry in shaping Medicare prescription drug reform to its liking. The experience suggests that political savvy and lobbying skills have become core competencies in the health care industry.

N2  - Over the past decade, public policies on prostitution and other types of sex work have been increasingly contested, both in academia and in popular debates. One perspective, the oppression paradigm, is increasingly reflected in media reporting on the sex industry and is steadily being articulated by government officials in the USA, Europe, and elsewhere. The proliferation of myths based on the oppression paradigm is responsible for the rise of a resurgent mythology of prostitution. This article examines the claims made by organizations, activists, and scholars who embrace the oppression paradigm, evaluates the reasoning and evidence used in support of their claims, and highlights some of the ways in which this perspective has influenced recent legislation and public policy in selected nations. The author presents an alternative perspective, the polymorphous paradigm, and suggests that public policy on prostitution would be better informed by this evidence-based perspective.

N2  - Central Bank Independence (CBI) enables monetary policymakers to act in a timely and appropriate manner in the pursuit of a single price stability objective. This paper presents a critical assessment of the legal and actual independence of central banks in three East African economies. It applies one de facto and four de jure measures of CBI and reveals that the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and Bank of Tanzania (BOT) had a higher actual independence in their early years of formation than in 1990-2006, while the Bank of Uganda (BOU) had a higher actual independence in 1986-2006 than in 1979-1986. The legal independence of the CBK and BOT has improved with the stipulation of a single policy objective, constrained finance amount and market determined interest rate on loans to government, as well as improved accountability. However, the method of appointment for governors, the term of office and dismissal of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the two central banks as well as the BOU reflect less independence. The amended statute of the BOU is less reformed for it does not specify a single policy objective, allows a higher amount of loan to the government, and is less accountable.

N2  - The Locarno Conference, held on 5-16 October 1925, represented the culmination of nearly two years of diplomatic communication between the foreign offices of Germany, Britain, and France. The conference was an attempt to normalize relations between the former Allied powers and Germany’s new Weimar Republic and more tightly bind Germany’s politics and economy to Western Europe. Colonial German lobbies hoped that the Locarno talks heralded the return of empire and an end to Germany’s banishment from the work of the ‘civilizing mission’ and the humiliating experience of being a ‘postcolonial state in a still colonial world’. Public scrutiny from false press reports about the restoration of the German colonies emanating from Germany, France, Britain and its colonies and dominions, and even the United States complicated matters for Locarno delegates by forcing discussion of off-agenda topics. This article interrogates how the Colonial German lobby influenced the Locarno Conference through activity in the international public sphere, how they managed a partial victory in the wake of Locarno, and more importantly, the Colonial German lobby learned new and better strategies for playing properly to public opinion and international bureaucracies.

N2  - At the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was publicly excluded from the European 'civilizing mission'. The victorious Allies stripped Germany of its overseas empire. The German colonies were awarded to other imperial powers as mandates under the League of Nations. This action was justified by citing colonial atrocities, such as the German campaign against the Herero, which were used to label Germans as 'exceptionally cruel colonial masters' and 'unfit imperialists'. Yet, during the tenure of the League's mandate system, several former German colonial officials rose to prominence in the League of Nations as 'imperial experts'. The involvement of German colonial officials in League agencies and events suggests that, although no longer part of an imperial power and officially ostracized from the 'work of civilization', Germans remained adaptive contributors to international discourses on empire. In order to determine how individual Germans and lobbying interests were able to make use of the spirit of internationalism to minimize their association with 'unfit imperialists' and re-establish themselves as 'fellow civilizers', this paper focuses on the interwar careers and interactions of two colonial officials: Dr Ludwig Kastl and Dr Julius Ruppel - former bureaucrats who had served in the African colonies, each of whom became German members on the PMC.

N2  - This article analyzes how the Hsinchu municipal government in Taiwan was
able in one instance to successfully relocate street vendors into a
thriving public market, the Zhu Lian market, but failed in another
instance to replicate this success with the Guan Dong market. These two
cases both involved in situ relocation of street vendors with similar
economic situations. Fieldwork and key informant interviews with vendors
and government officials were carried out in Hsinchu City, Taiwan, in
2012.
The research finds that street vendor organizations play a crucial role
during the relocation process. In game theory terms, the organization
can shape the multiplayer dynamic game of relocating a large number of
vendors to overcome the prisoner's dilemma and play a cooperative game
for mutual benefits. The article also discusses the potential pitfalls
of relying on strong vendor organizations in managing street vendors in
the city. Increasing the authority and autonomy of organizational
leaders can enable them to bypass lower-ranking officers and negotiate
directly with high-ranking officers and politicians, fostering a
political patronage system in the city.

N2  - The Constitution leaves the creation of the institutions of government to ordinary political processes. While intricate constitutionalized procedures govern the election of Congress, the President, and the Vice President, the Constitution anticipated but did not establish a host of other personnel and positions. Instead, it leaves the task of institution building to Congress. This Note argues that text, structure, and history demonstrate that the Constitution gives Congress exclusive authority over office creation. Textually, the Appointments Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause together empower Congress alone to ``establish{[}] by Law{''} federal offices. Structurally, Congress has the democratic and technical capacity to organize the government. And Congress's power to ``constitute{''} federal institutions mimics the original act of Constitution making: just as ``We the People{''} could ``ordain and establish this Constitution,{''} the Appointments Clause allows Congress to `` establish{[}] by Law . . . all other Officers of the United States.{''} Congress's exclusive office-creating power has surprising and important implications for a series of live constitutional controversies. In this Note, I discuss three issues regarding the balance of power between the President and Congress in structuring the administrative state. First, I evaluate the related problems of statutory qualifications clauses and for-cause removal provisions. Perhaps counterintuitively, I conclude that qualifications clauses should almost never raise constitutional issues, but for-cause removal provisions almost always should. The Constitution's distinction between ex ante office creation and ex post presidential control justifies such differential treatment. And it explains why Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board was rightly decided, but also articulates a limiting principle on the President's authority to control the executive branch. Second, I discuss the constitutionality of temporary appointments. Drawing on Justice Thomas's concurrence in NLRB v. SW General, Inc., I show that, in some circumstances, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 makes an unconstitutional `` end-run around the Appointments Clause.{''} But my interpretation of the Clause still gives Congress broad discretion to allow for temporary appointments. Third, this Note clarifies the employee/officer distinction in Appointments Clause jurisprudence. The Court's decision in Lucia v. SEC presents a series of puzzles for the employee/officer distinction that this Note attempts to resolve. Together, these three doctrinal issues illustrate how Congress's exclusive office-creating power ought to inform the constitutional analysis in separation-of-powers cases.

N2  - This paper draws upon the research carried out for a study of human resource needs of social workers in Canada to make a SWOT analysis of social work education and the profession. Strengths that were identified included a holistic practice orientation; the linkage between theory and practice; regulation and certification; a generalist approach to practice; increased cultural relevance of social work education; high quality social work programs; a continued demand for social workers; and the values of the profession. Weaknesses included a lack of professional identification, or identity crisis; an inability to promote the profession; the diffuse knowledge base of the profession; conflict between the values of social action and social control; a lack of preparation to manage the stress of our work; insufficient aboriginal, visible minority and multicultural members of the profession; and for aboriginal people, that social work can be seen as a residual effect of colonization. Threats to the profession included a trend to neoliberalism; increasing identification of social workers with the bureaucracy; increasing managerialization; increased community responsibility for service delivery; and interdisciplinarity. Opportunities identified included design of cost effective programs which meet service user needs; exercise of responsibility for social advocacy; development of managerial competence in social workers; extension of job opportunities through privatization; and articulation of social work competencies. © 2001, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - How does the informational role of interest groups interact with institutions when politicians seek to control the bureaucracy? In 1992, Banks and Weingast argued that bureaucrats hold an informational advantage vis-à-vis political principals concerning policy-relevant variables, and that when it is prohibitively costly to audit, the agency may over- or understate the extent of a public problem. This is less likely to happen if there is a low-cost monitoring technology and if interest groups can monitor the agency's choices. I test this hypothesis using data on bureaucratic statements that estimate the importance of a number of hazardous waste problems from a group of state-level environmental agencies. The results provide evidence for the Banks-Weingast hypothesis.

N2  - In 1836 the problem of safety at sea had first been placed before Parliament and the nation by the Select Committee on shipwrecks. The credit for securing the appointment of the Committee as well as for the reforms suggested in its report belongs to James Silk Buckingham, who was the first spokesman in Parliament for the cause of marine reform.2 Most of Buckingham’s early life was spent in the merchant navy. He went to sea as a boy of ten, and at the end of his seafaring career he commanded a ship in the West India trade. From the time he left the sea about 1817 until his election to Parliament in 1832, he was occupied as a journalist, traveller, and lecturer. His first journalistic venture, the Calcutta Journal, begun in 1818, ended in 1823 with a severe financial loss when Buckingham was expelled from India and the publication sup­ pressed by the Governor-General for his outspoken criticisms of the Government of India. For the next decade he was occupied with other journalistic ventures in England. With a background of seafaring, and an interest in social reform, it is not strange that, after his election to Parliament, he sought to remedy the conditions faced by seamen. After making a strong effort to force the government to abolish impressment, Buckingham turned his attention to the causes of shipwreck. In the report of the Select Committee of 1836, which presented a comprehensive plan for the professionalization of the merchant service, Buckingham enumerated the causes of maritime disaster that were then costing the nation the lives of some 900 seamen and an estimated.£2,836,000 in property annually. It was neither humane nor financially sound to allow the con­ tinuance of these losses arising from the poor construction of ships; from the use of unseaworthy vessels; from the incompetence of masters and mates too young or too poorly educated for their responsibilities; from drunkenness among officers and sea­men; and from the system of marine insurance which led owners to neglect ordinary precautions for safety.3 Before steps could be taken to improve conditions under which seamen worked and to ensure greater safety at sea, two pre-requisites had to be met. The first and more essential was to vest in a single department of government the sole responsibility for the enforcement of statutes regulating the merchant service. The second, the compilation of a code of maritime law, or at least a consolidation of exist­ ing enactments, some of them dating to the days of Elizabeth I, was to be one of the first duties of the proposed board, which was to consist of experienced officers from the Royal Navy and the merchant fleet, shipowners, and shipbuilders elected by the Admiralty, shipowners, and Trinity House.4 The board was to establish standards of qualification for seamanship. All who desired to hold responsible position on boardship were to pass examinations designed to test their competence. Government offices were to be established in the ports at which captains were to sign on their crews, thus eliminating the evils arising from dependence upon boarding-house keepers and crimps. Nautical schools were to be established. The new board was to be financed by fees charged for the registration of ships and for granting certificates to masters and mates. These steps, Buckingham was convinced, would greatly improve the merchant marine, making it the safest and most efficient in the world.

N2  - The lens of administration burden is used to examine the behavior of nonprofit organizations when managing regulations attached to public funding and public policy implementation. Interviews with leaders of nonprofit domestic violence advocacy organizations dependent on public funding streams were qualitatively content analyzed to answer three questions. How do nonprofit managers respond to burdensome bureaucratic reporting measures when they are at odds? How do they determine when to comply and when compliance is not possible? What is the outcome for service recipients? The authors find that these nonprofit organizations simultaneously implement multiple public policies while absorbing the accountability costs. They do this to shield their clients from the laborious task of obtaining a spectrum of services across public systems.

N2  - Politics may be characterized as “who gets what, when, and how” (Lasswell, 1965). Politics involve choices about how to distribute power, status, wealth, opportunities, and other social goods (Young, Levin, & Wallin, 2008). Public education is inherently political because it involves making decisions about how to organize schools, what knowledge children study, and which goals are pursued. Understanding politics requires that one understands power: Where is it located? What are its effects? How might it be wielded to achieve desired ends? This chapter introduces theories of power and interest groups that attempt to answer these questions. The theories and research reviewed in the chapter will help aspiring educational leaders meet the expectations of ISLLC’s (Council of Chief State School Officers, 2008) Standard 6: “An education leader promotes the success of every student by understanding, responding to, and influencing the political, social, economic, legal, and cultural context” (p. 15).

N2  - At the turn of the twentieth century, the proliferation of movies attracted not only the attention of audiences across America but also the apprehensive eyes of government officials and special interest groups concerned about the messages disseminated by the silver screen. Between 1907 and 1926, seven states-New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Kansas, Maryland, and Massachusetts-and more than one hundred cities authorized censors to suppress all images and messages considered inappropriate for American audiences. Movie studios, hoping to avoid problems with state censors, worrying that censorship might be extended to the federal level, and facing increased pressure from religious groups, also jumped into the censoring business, restraining content through the adoption of the self-censoring Production Code, also known as the Hays code.But some industry outsiders, independent distributors who believed that movies deserved the free speech protections of the First Amendment, brought legal challenges to censorship at the state and local levels. Freedom of the Screen chronicles both the evolution of judicial attitudes toward film restriction and the plight of the individuals who fought for the right to deliver provocative and relevant movies to American audiences. The path to cinematic freedom was marked with both achievements and roadblocks, from the establishment of the Production Code Administration, which effectively eradicated political films after 1934, to the landmark cases over films such as The Miracle (1948), La ronde (1950), and Lady Chatterley's Lover (1955) that paved the way for increased freedom of expression. As the fight against censorship progressed case by case through state courts and the U.S. Supreme Court, legal authorities and the public responded, growing increasingly sympathetic toward artistic freedom. Because a small, unorganized group of independent film distributors and exhibitors in mid-twentieth-century America fought back against what they believed was the unconstitutional prior restraint of motion pictures, film after 1965 was able to follow a new path, maturing into an artistic medium for the communication of ideas, however controversial. Government censors would no longer control the content of America's movie screens. Laura Wittern-Keller's use of previously unexplored archival material and interviews with key figures earned her the researcher of the year award from the New York State Board of Regents and the New York State Archives Partnership Trust. Her exhaustive work is the first to discuss more than five decades of film censorship battles that rose from state and local courtrooms to become issues of national debate and significance. A compendium of judicial action in the film industry, Freedom of the Screen is a tribute to those who fought for the constitutional right of free expression and paved the way for the variety of films that appear in cinemas today.

N2  - Public choice (sometimes known as rational choice) assumes that individuals act to promote their own interests. From this simple assumption, a large body of theoretical and empirical work has been spawned. Much of this research shows that bureaucrats, politicians, and pressure groups get their way at the expense of the voters and that regulation reflects the desires of these concentrated interests rather than the appropriate balancing of all the costs and benefits. But if one really believes in the economic model of behavior, then one should be skeptical of such results. After all, it was Adam Smith who showed that the self-interest of the baker and the candlestick maker leads them to provide what consumers desire. So by the same economic logic, one should expect that the invisible hand works for the democratic political system, as well. Now there are counter arguments to this last statement, but in this chapter I counter these counter arguments by using standard economic theory and methodology. Along the way, I show that many of the negative results arise because the authors (1) have incorrectly assumed that the political system is characterized by monopoly rather than by competition, and (2) have implicitly assumed that voters are irrational, which, of course, is contrary to the rational choice paradigm. The arguments that I use against the theory of special interests can also serve as the foundation for a theory that democratic markets are well served by the invisible hand. © Cambridge University Press and The Tobin Projec 2010.

N2  - The ruler’s ability to cope with crises is critical for authoritarian durability. Yet, the coping mechanism—the actual management strategies by which rulers confront crises—is largely treated as a black box. This study takes a step in addressing this problem by examining how rulers use their appointment powers to manage the crisis that is the aftermath of failed coups. I argue that the principle challenge of this period is that rulers cannot identify the opposition and to cope, they deliberately infuse the center of the regime with officials from the periphery to dilute and ultimately weaken the invisible enemy they confront. Using a novel dataset on the appointments of mid and high level officials over the course of 34 years in Ethiopia, I find that the ruler relied considerably on outside officials following the failed coup in 1960 in ways he never did before or after the event. © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - Class struggle is the root cause of the political stagnation of the late capitalist state. At home vested interest block reforms favorable to powerless groups while the majoritarian residue of liberal democracy formally prevents the state from serving as an unmediated arm of the ruling class. The single most noteworthy feature of the public life of late capitalism is the intransigence of bureaucracy. The problems associated with politicization, centralization, decentralization, and rationalization reinforce the point that in late capitalism public administration assumes many of the contradictions once existing in the economy. The ambiguities, confusions, and irrationalities of the late capitalist state adversely affect the quest for legitimation. A central political development of late capitalist society has been an increase in the tendency to view the state as capable of solving problems that lie outside its competence. The reification of the state is a key aspect of the political life of late capitalist societies.

N2  - Adaptive management has become increasingly common where natural resource managers face complex and uncertain conditions. The collaboration required among managers and others to do adaptive management, however, is not always easy to achieve. We describe efforts to work with villagers and government officials in Malinau, East Kalimantan Indonesia, where a weak, uncertain institutional setting and complex shifting political landscape made formal cooperation among these groups for forest management problematic. Through successive trials, the team learned instead to work with and enhance a "spontaneous order" of cooperation using four tactics: (1) continuous physical presence, (2) regular contact with the people who advised and were close to major decision makers, (3) maintenance of multiple programs to fit the needs of different interest groups, and (4) hyperflexibility in resource allocation and schedules..

N2  - Less than two decades after the first wave of Hmong refugees arrived in the United States during the 1980s, several Hmong Americans have displayed a strong interest and aptitude for mainstream electoral politics. The person of Hmong descent who has attained the highest elected office to date is Mee Moua, winning election as the first Hmong American state senator in Minnesota in 2002. After serving two terms, Moua announced in 2010 that she would not run for a third term. Meanwhile, in California in 2006, Blong Xiong won election as the first Hmong American member of the Fresno City Council. These public servants followed a path in politics set by Choua Lee, who was elected to the school board in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1991, and Joe Bee Xiong, city councilman in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, from 1996 to 2000. In view of the relative recency of the Hmong refugees' settlement in America and their modest financial resources, what explains these electoral successes? Analyzing Mee Moua's first election campaign, Yoshikawa (2006) demonstrated that Hmong voters can be mobilized through clanbased social organization in the Hmong community. But successful Hmong candidates have used dual mechanisms of mobilization-gaining support of traditional leaders and access to voters through existing Hmong social organizations-while also reaching outward across racial-ethnic lines to attract support from voters outside Hmong ethnic enclaves. To extend understanding of opportunities and challenges for Hmong political engagement, I examine in this study how Hmong Americans themselves describe the nature of their interest in American politics. Interviews of Hmong firstgeneration immigrants reveal a high regard for political engagement as an avenue to improve the lives of Hmong in the United States. In addition, first-generation immigrants tend to hold aspirations for their children to pursue careers as government officials. There are precedents in American ethnic history for a new ethnic group choosing politics rather than business enterprise as its route for group advancement. Irish Americans found their way into mainstream social life through politics, constructing urban party machines that provided services and employment to constituents in exchange for their votes. As Daniel Boorstin describes, Irish American politicians adapted village-style patronage politics learned in the homeland to American city life, turning themselves into a "personal service agency" for immigrant constituents (1973, 259). Not a small factor in their success was the lack of legal restrictions on voting by noncitizens until 1926. Somewhat similarly, Hmong Americans found a fast path to citizenship at the turn of the twenty-first century. Lobbying Congress with success for the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000, Hmong American men who had served on the side of the U.S. military during the Vietnam War (and soon afterward their wives) gained the opportunity to use English translators when taking citizenship tests. It is clearly possible for new immigrant groups to take the political route to economic opportunity and social inclusion, but the Irish and Hmong American cases suggest that lowering barriers to immigrant voting are probably prerequisites. At the same time, new immigrant groups benefit from adapting traditional political values and practices customary in the homeland to the host society's environment.

N2  - Purpose A debate emerged among members of public administration academia soon after COVID-19 appeared on the roles and measures that governments ought to deploy to prevent infection. One prevalent discourse is the strength of "strong government" in the fight against the virus-the administrative capacity to launch prompt, appropriate and effective actions that entail collaboration with citizens. A notable development in governance is that new public management (NPM) principles, such as the value of money and the pluralisation of service delivery, are gradually put aside when governments urgently need to curb the spread of infection. The roles of bureaucracy and centralised action are re-emphasised in the policymaking and implementation of anti-epidemic measures. Such a trend allows us to examine if the COVID-19 public health crisis has fundamentally reversed the trend of government retreat in public service within neoliberal regimes since the 1980s. Design/methodology/approach For this research, the authors selected two "strong governments" in Asia-Hong Kong and Taiwan-by showing how administrators outline their anti-pandemic strategies, examining the role of government in coordinating responses and how bureaucracy interacts with the other two key domains of the governance mechanism: civil society and the market. These two offshore Chinese capitalist economies and pluralistic societies are perceived to have "strong government capacity" in the fight against COVID-19, presumably as a key attribute to their success confining the spread of infection during the early stages of the first outbreak. Both societies reported low infection rates and low mortality rates until September 2020. The authors browsed databases developed by scholars (Cheng et al., 2020; Hale et al., 2020) and referred to two "rubrics" to assess and compare government actions in both places in response to COVID-19. The authors itemised, categorised and counted the policy actions in both places according to the rubrics, noticed that the policy footprint appeared in over two-thirds of indicators of proactive government interventions and identified double-digit counts in nearly half of the categories. Findings The authors found that both governments attempted to establish strong stewardship and quick measures to contain the infection. The pattern of "strong government" is, however, not the same as that superficially exhibited. Taiwan took limited steps to regulate business activities but proactively intervened and coordinated the supply of hygienic utilities. Hong Kong launched aggressive attempts to reduce human mobility but remained non-active despite the "face mask run" in society. The "strong government" aspect also received divergent reactions from society. There was extensive cross-sectoral collaboration under the centralised "National Team" advocacy in Taiwan, and there has been no record of local infection for over 10 months. The Hong Kong government was repeatedly doubted for its undesirable stewardship in anti-epidemic measures, the effectiveness of policy interventions and the impartiality of law enforcement. Spontaneous actions during the health crisis from civil societies and private markets were noted, but they seemed uncoordinated with official attempts. Originality/value The initial findings enable us to rethink correlations between state capacity and legitimacy in the fight against the virus and its development post-COVID-19. Apparently, Taiwan and Hong Kong demonstrated a "re-expansion" of their public sector during the public health crisis, but not in the same format. This can be understood based on their varying regime values and administrative systems. The pandemic has been a catalyst, pushing both regimes back to their original track of public administration establishments. The concept of "path dependence" might explain the initial development and project the longer-term transformation of the public sector in both places.

N2  - Public finance theory dictates that intergovernmental transfers should help alleviate horizontal fiscal imbalances among local jurisdictions. The amount of intergovernmental fiscal transfers should be inversely related to each local jurisdiction’s revenue-generating capacity. However, intense politicking in many countries turns an intergovernmental fiscal transfer system into a battle of local and particularistic interests. This article illustrates a disjuncture between the theory and practice of intergovernmental equalization transfers with the quantitative and qualitative evidence from 226 local administrative organizations in Khon Kaen province in northeastern Thailand. Findings indicate that Thailand’s current intergovernmental fiscal transfer system is not oriented toward achieving local horizontal equity. In Khon Kaen, local administrative organizations with high fiscal capacity tend to receive more equalization grants than financially disadvantaged jurisdictions. In-depth interviews with selected local government officials in Khon Kaen reveal inconsistency and heavy politicization of the country’s intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. © 2014 SAGE Publications.

N2  - In many states, administrative rules are subject to review by elected political officials in the legislative and/or executive branches. Using recently developed measures of state rule review powers, this study investigates whether they serve to enhance or diminish interest group influence on the content of agency regulations. It finds that both greater gubernatorial and legislative rule review authority significantly decrease the amount of interest group influence reported by state agency directors. These results provide evidence that powers of external rule review may serve to counteract the effects of subsystem policy making.

N2  - A broad range of procedural mechanisms designed to promote public involvement in regulatory decision making have been instituted at all levels of government. Depending upon the literature one consults, one could conclude that these procedures (1) enhance regulatory stringency by fostering access by previously underrepresented groups, (2) reduce regulatory stringency by institutionalizing access by regulated industries, (3) could either increase or decrease stringency depending on the relative strength of organized interests in the agency's external environment, or (4) have no effect. This study investigates whether mechanisms designed to promote public involvement in administrative rulemaking affect the stringency of US state environmental regulation. The results suggest that requirements to provide public notice of agency rulemaking do not have a significant effect on the regulatory compliance costs imposed on industry, but mechanisms that provide direct access to rulemaking processes serve to decrease these costs. This effect is evident for access both to the agencies promulgating environmental regulations and to external entities reviewing these regulations. For promulgating agencies, the effect does not appear to be conditional on the relative power of societal interests. The results provide some evidence, however, that political officials respond to the strength of environmental and industry groups when reviewing agency regulations.

N2  - Various reforms at the federal level have led bureaucracies, including arts councils, to design and implement performance measurement systems. We still know very little about whether performance measurement has any influence on the external conditions of arts councils, or whether it serves as policy rhetoric for arts advocacy. In this article, we seek to understand the answers to these questions by conducting a case study of performance measurement at the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). We conclude that there is little evidence that performance measurement at the NEA has had any appreciable effects on agency appropriation levels. Therefore, as a policy response to federally mandated performance measurement systems, arts councils might do better in focusing exclusively on metrics that capture internal efficiency, as opposed to those that serve to demonstrate performance to external constituencies.

N2  - The UK Government's policy report (Cabinet Office, 2008) entitled ``Excellence and Fairness in Public Services{''}, sets out the new phase of reform which should enable public services to go from ``good to great{''} focused on the needs of service users and citizens, who are empowered to express their needs and make informed choices, rather than around traditional professional structures of service provider hierarchies and organisational boundaries or ``.... moving to Dynamic capability - becoming more creative and more capably handling the wicked problems of leadership rather than working in the old familiar ways{''} (Clark cited in Public Servant (Thomas, 2008)). However, recent departmental capability reviews across the UK government (Barwise et al. 2007) identified improving leadership within the UK civil service, as key to achieving ``world class{''} public services (Cabinet Office, 2008). In addition, Sutherland and Ley (2009), who interviewed senior civil servants responsible for leading the delivery of the UK government's strategic objectives, clearly identified the need to improve the quality of, and the skills required for, effective collaboration across the public service as one of their key challenges. In a new era of collaboration, public service leaders in the 21(st) century need to be able to work collaboratively across the whole public service system horizontally across organisational and sector boundaries, but also vertically across national, regional and local levels of governance (Seddon, 2008; Benington and Hartley, 2009). This will need to use traditional skills such as diplomat and specialist, but also move ``towards using post conventional action logics (mindsets) such as individualist, strategist and alchemist, stepping beyond their existing frameworks into new and more integrative and inclusive action logics{''} (Mead, 2009). This provides a significant challenge to both public services and to their respective leadership academies. Such an alliance of sector based public service leadership academies is attempting to model collaborative working across organisational and sector boundaries, to co-create and deliver a new leadership development initiative. This collaboration build public service leaders capacity to work collaboratively across the whole public service system to improve outcomes for individuals, citizens and communities of place and interest. This working paper sets out an emerging approach for exploring two key issues arising from this work. Firstly, the challenges faced by the leaders of a disparate group of organisations, working within different business models, seeking to work together to create better public service leaders capable of responding to intractable, interdependent, socio-economic problems or ``wicked issues{''} (Grint, 2008; Thomas, 2008). Secondly, whether in developing their new collaborative leadership initiative, the alliance is able to resist being drawn back into institutional silos and into delivering old models of leadership ``teaching the right answers instead of co-creating new knowledge and theory about how to effectively lead across the public service system (Mead, 2008). This exploratory research will seek to build theory from observation and interpretation of people's experiences (Yin, 2003). It will use the development of the leadership initiative by the alliance as a case study, using quantitative as well as qualitative methods in a mixed methodology approach also known as the ``pragmatic paradigm{''} (Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998).

N2  - Urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions depend on governments implementing and enforcing rigorous climate policy. Individuals in democracies seeking to persuade government officials to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can take steps such as voting, protesting, and contacting officials directly, but it is unclear how effective each of these actions is in changing the behavior of elected officials. Here we take advantage of the public nature of social media to evaluate the actual efficacy of climate campaign emails using an original, real-world experiment where 335 Members of Canadian Parliament were asked by constituents to post a pro-climate message to their Twitter account. Only one Member of Parliament posted the exact text suggested by the campaign. After scraping and coding 18,776 tweets, we first find no evidence that a public health messaging frame is more effective than a standard environmental frame in eliciting pro-climate posts. Furthermore, we find only a marginally significant relationship between volume of constituent contact and increased pro-climate tweeting from Members of Parliament. Follow-up interviews with political staffers suggest that analog alternatives may be more effective than campaign emails in some cases. Interview findings also reveal that some offices receive low levels of constituent communication on climate change, indicating that increased pressure from constituents could still be consequential.

N2  - As the executor of the public policy and the wielder of the public right, the Chinese grass-roots civil servants plays a foundational role in the group of the civil servant in China. In society, their work is closely linked to the life of the public. The object of their work is the most general public. They most closely connect with the public. The quality of their work has a direct bearing on the interest of the public and the effectiveness of public policy. And the occupational Well-being of them directly affects their attitude toward work and the quality of their work. In recent years, there are investigations which shows that the occupational Well-being of Chinese grass-roots civil servants is not high, and the mental health status of the civil servants is not optimistic. Based on the job characteristics of Chinese grass-roots civil servants, according to some theories like self-determination theory, this article put forward a theoretical model of the occupational Well-being of the Chinese civil servants in this paper. In this model, Social support, career identity, and psychological capital make up the antecedent variables, occupational well-being is the central variable, and work engagement is the outcome variable. This paper is aimed at laying a theoretical foundation for subsequent empirical research, and offering theoretical guidance for human resource management of public sectors.

N2  - I combine newly digitized personnel and public finance data from the
British colonial administration for the period 1854-1966 to study how
patronage affects the promotion and incentives of governors. Governors
are more likely to be promoted to higher salaried colonies when
connected to their superior during the period of patronage. Once
allocated, they provide more tax exemptions, raise less revenue, and
invest less. The promotion and performance gaps disappear after the
abolition of patronage appointments. Patronage therefore distorts the
allocation of public sector positions and reduces the incentives of
favored bureaucrats to perform.

N2  - This study broadens the explanation of regional imbalance in China's international trade growth. Unlike most studies in this field tiying to explore the roots of the imbalanced status from traditional economic theoiy, this study adopts the interest group theoiy from political economy,explaining the relationship between regional imbalance of trade development and the State-Owned Enterprises' (SOEs) growth. The SOEs can be viewed as interest groups tiying to influence the government policy making process and did achieve their goal since some SOEs' leaders are also government officials or formal governmental staffs. Given other economic conditions of one region in a certain period, the regional international trade is generally negatively influenced by the local SOEs,growth. The empirical tests are conducted with the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) regression in the framework of fixed effect model using annual data of 29 provinces in mainland China from 1995 to 2010. The results prove the hypotheses that given other conditions, regional SOEs' growth contributes negatively to both the corresponding regional foreign trade as a whole as well as import and export as independent components. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

N2  - Using focus group discussion with participants from 4 NGOs in Ghana that focus on anti-domestic violence advocacy and survivor and victims support work, this research takes a closer look at the experiences organi-zations have while accessing government supported available institutional resources. Findings suggest that while legislation has indeed created the space for women's rights in Ghana, the pathways towards justice in both the north and the south are thwarted by an underfunded and poorly managed bureaucracy, complicated by an overall patriarchal attitude. There is thus a need to increase gender sensitivity training among all ranks and sections of government institutions and bureaucracy. Research findings also suggest a need for increased funding and the establishment of a well-organized network between survivors, organizations and various government departments and legal aid to create efficient networks that facilitate faster reporting, communication, and de-livery of justice. More importantly, research participant directed policy recommendations suggest a renewed attempt to strengthening existing laws, the creation of an easily accessible survivor support fund that involves less bureaucratic navigation and a goal towards building self-efficacy and skills, and an institutional process that involves survivors in policy planning and implementation.

N2  - Can Justice Department officials effectively investigate wrongdoing within their own administration without relying on an independent counsel? In Prosecution among Friends political scientist David Alistair Yalof explores the operation of due process as it is navigated within the office of the attorney general and its various subdivisions. The attorney general holds a politically appointed position within the administration and yet, as the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer, is still charged with holding colleagues and superiors legally accountable. That duty extends to allegations against those who had a hand in appointing the attorney general in the first place: Even the President of the United States may be enmeshed in a Justice Department investigation overseen by the attorney general and other department officials.? To assess this fundamental problem, Yalof examines numerous cases of executive branch corruption-real or alleged-that occurred over the course of four decades beginning with the Nixon administration and extending up through the second Bush administration. All of these cases-Watergate, Whitewater, and others-were identified and reported to varying degrees in the press and elsewhere. Some garnered significant attention; others drew only limited interest at the time. In all such cases the attorney general and other officials within the executive branch were charged with initially assessing the matter and determining the proper road for moving forward. Only a handful of the cases resulted in the appointment of a statutorily protected independent counsel.

Not available 
N2  - The political reforms that have been going on since the 1990s have drastically changed the face of politics in Japan. The most significant of these reforms was the change of government, which brought an end, albeit only once, to the long-standing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) regime. These changes were expected to change the power structure by altering the contact of interest groups with political elites. I examine this issue based on a longitudinal survey conducted in four rounds between 1997 and 2017. The results show a robust structure of interest group politics, although the features were weakening. That is, contacts with the LDP and the bureaucracy were sources of political influence for interest groups. The impact of the two-party system and its setbacks are seen in the change in contact with the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). However, The DPJ did not function as a source of interest representation.

N2  - Although the political context in Uganda exhibits democratic deficit and patronage, research and development actors have given little attention to the possible negative impact these may have on agricultural policymaking and implementation processes. This article examines the influence of power in perpetuating prevailing narratives around public participation in agricultural policymaking processes. The analysis is based on qualitative data collected between September 2014 and May 2015 using 86 in-depth interviews, 18 focus group discussions, and recorded observations in stakeholder consultations. Results indicate that while the political setting provides space for uncensored debates, the policymaking process remains under close control of political leaders, technical personnel, and high-level officers in the government. Policy negotiation remains limited to actors who are knowledgeable about the technical issues and those who have the financial resources and political power to influence decisions, such as international donors. There is limited space for negotiation of competing claims and interests in the processes by public and private actors actively engaged in agricultural development, production, processing, and trade. Thus, efforts to achieve good governance in policy processes fall short due to lack of approaches that promote co-design and co-ownership of the policies.

N2  - Women are underrepresented in public sector leadership positions, including municipal management. We examine one explanation that may contribute to gender inequity in the profession-a ``glass cliff{''} phenomenon whereby councils are more likely to hire women as managers during difficult times, increasing the likelihood for women to fail in the position. Using original observational data on municipal managers in Florida, we test whether municipalities are more likely to hire women during times of fiscal stress and whether women are more likely than men to leave the position if municipal finances do not improve. Our results show that increasing budget deficits are associated with municipalities hiring women as managers. Post-appointment, a lack of improvement in the deficit condition is associated with a higher probability of women, but not men, leaving the position. A glass cliff in municipal management could be one factor that hinders women from advancing within the field. Evidence for Practice Municipalities are more likely to hire women as managers when faced with increasing budget deficits. When deficit conditions fail to improve post-appointment, women have a higher probability than men of leaving the position. The glass cliff may be one barrier to women's advancement in the field of municipal management, as a woman who faces a glass cliff may find it more difficult to reach top leadership positions again due to harm to her professional reputation. Objective evaluation metrics that benchmark the assessment of managers to the organizational condition and trends at the time of hire may be useful for scholars and practitioners alike in mitigating gender biases in municipal personnel decisions.

N2  - Given the present level of institutional quality and the significant role of the government sector in the economy, the Russian Federation has depleted the potential of the current model of growth which is based on commodity exports. The dramatic deceleration of the GDP growth rate down to less than 2% in the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013 bears the evidence to this proposition. At the moment, the government considers the choice between expansionist and conservative scenarios, which both lie on the assumption of long-term conservation of existing imperfect institutions. However, according to our estimates, it is impossible to create a new model of growth ignoring the role of private initiative, healthy institutions of market economy and investment in human capital. We distinguish two groups that are increasing their influence nowadays and can potentially become the driving force of a new model of Russian economic growth: “new business”, dynamic companies that are oriented at the development in the market conditions but lack incentive to invest within existing institutional framework; “new bureaucracy”, consisting of progressive regional elites, who are interested in the development of their area, and efficient professionals of the federal level.

N2  - How do bureaucrat-local politician relations affect the inclusiveness of local governance in emerging democracies? This study answers the question through conducting a case study of Tunisia. The study evaluates interview data recently collected among 39 municipalities in socio-economically divergent regions with mayors, city council members, civil society members, and a governor, and examines transparency data compiled for all 350 municipalities by an independent civil society organization. The findings suggest that partisanship appointment of governors can limit the inclusiveness of local governance through perpetuating hierarchical relations with mayors at the expense of inclusive local engagement mechanisms. An analysis on the Transparency Index of municipalities within governorates with identified partisanship ties (n = 206) indicates that municipal governance becomes less transparent when a governor shares a political background similar to the ideological position of the mayor’s party. Thus, partisan appointments of bureaucrats can have implications for the inclusiveness of local governance.

In contrast to the attention placed on British intelligence activities in territories considered within the `formal empire' (i.e. where Britain was in direct control), we know very little about intelligence arrangements in `informal empire,' where external powers exerted influence and protected their interests by working through local elites. Exploiting declassified documents and drawing upon interviews with retired intelligence officials, this article reveals Britain's unique intelligence system in a remote corner of empire - the Trucial States (today's United Arab Emirates) - which was built around a group of roaming officers tasked with collecting full-spectrum intelligence.

N2  - Background: District Health Network (DHN), one of Iran’s most successful health reforms, was launched in 1985 to provide primary health care (PHC), in response to health inequities in Iran. The present study aims to use interrelated elements of the 3i framework: ideas (e.g., beliefs and values, culture, knowledge, research evidence and solutions), interests (e.g., civil servants, pressure groups, elected parties, academians and researchers, and policy entrepreneurs), and institutions (e.g., rules, precedents, and organizational, government structures, policy network, and policy legacies) to explain retrospectively how (DHN) policy in Iran, as a developing country, was initiated and formed. Methods: A historical narrative approach with a case study perspective was employed to focus on the formation and framing process of DHN. For this purpose, the 3i framework was used as a guideline for data analysis. This study mainly searched and extracted secondary sources, including online news, reports, books, dissertations, and published articles in the scientific databases. Primary interviews as a supplementary source were also carried out to meet cross-validation of the data. Data were analyzed using a deductive and inductive approach. Results: According to the 3i framework, the following factors contributed to the formation of DHN policy in Iran: previous national efforts (for instance Rezaieh plan) and international events aiming to provide public health services for peripheral regions; dominant social discourses and values at the beginning of the Iranian revolution such as addressing the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups, which were embedded in the goals of DHN policy aiming to provide basic health services for deprived people especially living in rural and remote areas. Besides, the remarkable social cohesion and solidarity among people reinforced by the Iran-Iraq war were among other factors which contributed to the formation of participatory plans such as DHN (ideas). Main policy entrepreneurs including Minister of Health, his public health deputy and two planners of DHN with similar and rich background in the public health field and sharing the same beliefs (interests) which subsequently led to creation of tight-knit policy community network between them (institutions) also accelerated the creation of DHN in Iran to great extent. Political support of parliamentary representatives (interests), and formal laws such as principles of Iran Constitution (institutions) were also influential in passing the DHN in Iran. Conclusions: The 3i framework constituents would be insightful in explaining the creation of public health policies. This framework showed that the alignment of laws, structures, and interests of the main actors of the policy with the dominant ideas and beliefs in the society, opened the opportunity to form DHN in Iran. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Nowadays the innovation of administrative culture becomes urgent need and key points of administrative system reform. How to transform the traditional administration culture to modernized one is the difficult point for the construction of Chinese administration culture. The administrative culture spread by two forms: longitudinal spread and transverse spread. our analysis and our opinion on the reconstruction of the Chinese traditional administrative culture will initiate from the two directions. From these two directions, the idea, methods and foundations of traditional administrative culture are different, only careful analysis and comparison can get twice the result with half the effort and finally realize the mutual supplementation and exert each own advantage of the contents delivered from these two directions. During the modernized reconstruction of traditional administrative culture, the administrative culture advocated by the government longitudinally and the administrative culture evolved spontaneously from the consideration of individual interests of administrative personnel of grass roots interwork and affect with each other and form the administrative culture which is popularized in current society. The reconstruction of longitudinal administrative culture, if matches with the recessive culture of civil servants group, will not only benefits the spread and advancement of national administrative ideology, but also benefits the reform of whole social culture; contrarily, if the contents of these two parts contradicts with each other, then the administrative culture advocated by the nation will be face a hard game between the administrative culture initiated by the government and hidden rules, and may be twisted or becomes impracticable.

N2  - Context: State health officials (SHOs), the executive and administrative leaders of state public health, play a key role in policy development, must be versed in the relevant/current evidence, and provide expertise about health issues to the legislature and the governor. Objective: To provide an empirical examination of SHO backgrounds and qualifications over time. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional survey of current/former SHOs. Main Outcome Measures: State health official educational backgrounds; public health experience; previous employment setting. Results: Two-thirds of respondents (64.6%) reported having a medical degree, approximately half (48.3%) a formal public health degree, and almost one-quarter (21.8%) a management degree. The majority had governmental public health experience at some prior point in their career (70.0%). Almost two-thirds worked in governmental public health immediately before becoming an SHO. The proportion that was female increased significantly by decade from 5.6% in the 1970s/80s to 46.4% in the 2010s (P =.02). Conclusions: The main finding from this study shows that more than two-thirds of SHOs have had governmental public health experience at some point in their career. This is not a new trend as there were no statistical differences in public health experience by decade. More than half of the SHOs were appointed to the role directly from governmental public health, indicating that their public health experience is timely and likely germane to their appointment as SHO. Findings also indicate improvements in gender diversity among one of the most influential leadership roles in governmental public health whereas significant changes in racial and ethnic diversity were not identified. Women are increasingly being appointed as SHOs, indicating increasing gender diversity in this influential position. Given that governmental public health employees are predominantly women, there is still room for gender equity improvements in executive leadership roles. This is coupled with the need for further racial and ethnic diversity improvements as well. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Whereas taxation on alcohol is becoming an increasingly common practice in many countries as part of overall public health measures, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is bucking the trend and lowered its duties on wine and beer by 50 percent in 2007. In 2008, Hong Kong removed all duties on alcohol except for spirits. The aim of this paper is to examine the case of Hong Kong with its history of changes in alcohol taxation to explore the factors that have driven such an unprecedented policy evolution. Methods. The research is based on an analysis of primary documents. Searches of official government documents, alcohol-related industry materials and other media reports on alcohol taxation for the period from 2000 to 2008 were systematically carried out using key terms such as "alcohol tax" and "alcohol industry". Relevant documents (97) were indexed by date and topic to undertake a chronological and thematic analysis using Nvivo8 software. Results: Our analysis demonstrates that whereas the citys changing financial circumstances and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Governments strong propensity towards economic liberalism had, in part, contributed to such dramatic transformation, the alcohol industrys lobbying tactics and influence were clearly the main drivers of the policy decision. The alcohol industrys lobbying tactics were two-fold. The first was to forge a coalition encompassing a range of catering and trade industries related to alcohol as well as industry-friendly lawmakers so that these like-minded actors could find common ground in pursuing changes to the taxation policy. The second was to deliberately promote a blend of ideas to garner support from the general public and to influence the perception of key policy makers. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the success of aggressive industry lobbying coupled with the absence of robust public health advocacy was the main driving force behind the unparalleled abolition of wine and beer duties in Hong Kong. Strong public health alliance and advocacy movement are needed to counteract the industrys continuing aggressive lobby and promotion of alcoholic beverages.

N2  - The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that 33 million people worldwide are HIV-positive.1 The AIDS epidemic presents one of the greatest challenges to public health systems around the world, straining national budgets and medical expertise worldwide. Not only is AIDS incurable, but it also disproportionately afflicts people in their early adult years. The very people who should be contributing to the economic, political, and social development of the state are instead falling ill and dying. This has huge social and economic costs. It also harms governance and democratization.2 In response, states, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and intergovernmental organizations have taken an active role in providing access to treatment, education, and prevention programs. Given the magnitude and effects of the AIDS epidemic, this is not surprising. What is surprising, though, is that, instead of predicating their actions simply on public health grounds, advocates for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) increasingly argue that education programs and treatment access are matters of human rights. For example, UNAIDS declares, "The risk of HIV infection and its impact feeds on violations of human rights, including discrimination against women and marginalized groups. . . . Over the past decade the critical need for strengthening human rights to effectively respond to the epidemic and deal with its effects has become evermore clear. Protecting human rights and promoting public health are mutually reinforcing."3 The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies specifically advocates human rights as a cornerstone of its AIDS prevention programs. Protecting rights, it argues, will empower vulnerable groups to demand education, economic opportunities, and protection from violence. This, in turn, will reduce HIV transmission.4 Amnesty International notes that human rights abuses contribute to HIV's spread and undermine treatment efforts, and Human Rights Watch finds that such abuses fuel transmission, which in turn leads to additional abuses and discrimination.5 Similarly, Physicians for Human Rights encourages medical professionals to both treat the disease and call attention to its underlying causes.6 In this approach, health care workers can use their public credibility to highlight violations of economic, social, and cultural rights and the ways in which those violations increase a person's vulnerability to infection. Historically, disease containment has not involved human rights strategies but has instead relied on "coercion, compulsion, and restrictions."7 Reciprocally, diseases have not typically been the subject of human rights activism. Today's emphasis on human rights in HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention therefore represents a major and contentious shift in public health policy and human rights advocacy. Why did public health officials move away from traditional strategies and turn to human-rights-based strategies for confronting AIDS? Why did human rights NGOs accept HIV/AIDS as a rights issue? By examining these changes, we can see how the meaning of the area of human rights itself has evolved and how strong advocates in critical positions can catalyze change. In the first section of this chapter I identify three human rights approaches to AIDS. Next I explain how advocates began promoting rights arguments against the public health orthodoxy of the mid-1980s. This effort started at the national level, led by public health officials and domestic AIDS activists particularly in the United States. As discussed in the third section, similar rights-based approaches to AIDS were brought to international organizations by a few well-placed individuals, most importantly Dr. Jonathan Mann, initial director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Program on AIDS (GPA). Mann's advocacy faced stiff opposition from WHO bureaucrats imbued with traditional public health attitudes, but the battle in this key international organization helped inform the world about the advantages of integrating human rights into AIDS policy. In this context and under pressure from their own AIDS advocates, key states began adopting their own rightsbased policies concerning the disease in the early 1990s, as discussed in the following sections on Brazil and South Africa. By the mid-1990s, conventional human rights NGOs, long reluctant to embrace AIDS as a rights issue, also began changing their attitudes, as discussed in the chapter's final section.

N2  - Attitudes to population policy taken by major international institutions display a lack of symmetry. Population-based institutions forcefully set out the effects of population on development and human welfare. In contrast, institutions and lobbies concerned with hunger, poverty and environment, brought together at the 2003 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, treat population growth as a given, independent, variable. This paper gives a land resources viewpoint. It includes a case study of Malawi and cross-country statistical comparisons. Official estimates of the extent of spare land, cultivable but not presently cultivated, are challenged. It is concluded that in low-income, food-deficit countries population increase has reduced, in some areas nullified, advances in agricultural development. Following the 1994 UN Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, a set of ethically acceptable measures for reducing population growth received general acceptance. All concerned with poverty, hunger and environment should follow the policy road from Cairo to Johannesburg. If greater efforts are not made to reduce rates of population increase, the targets of the Millennium declaration will not be met, and the suffering which these cause will continue. Statements about agriculture, food security, poverty and sustainability should recognize that population is not an external variable but an integral part of development.

N2  - The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations aspire to create the world's most ambitious trade agreement between the world's two largest economies. The politics associated with TTIP are different from those associated with previous trade negotiations. Moreover, they diverge from the prevailing International Political Economy (IPE) account of trade policy. The politics of TTIP diverge from the conventional IPE account of trade politics in two particularly noteworthy ways. First, rather than being rivals, American and European business interests are allies, adopting common positions on what they want the agreement to look like. Second, opposition within both the USA and the EU comes not primarily from firms and workers fearing increased economic competition, but from less traditional trade actors - consumer and environmental groups and citizens - concerned about the erosion of valued regulations. I argue that the unusual politics is the product of two distinct, but related factors. The first is the extraordinary level of cross-investment between the two economies. The second concerns the unique emphasis on addressing non-tariff barriers, particularly regulatory differences, and the significance of the negotiating partner. I test the plausibility of these arguments through within-case variation and by preliminary comparison to other contemporary negotiations of deep' preferential trade agreements.

N2  - This study analyzes the power source of Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) leaders by sorting out the unique selection and appointment mechanism of SOE cadres in China and the organizational structure behind this mechanism. Empirical research finds when local core officials are investigated for corruption, it has a major impact on the top leaders of local SOEs due to ‘top to bottom’ personnel changes, which would in turn have a strong impact on corporate investment behavior. However, the magnitude of such impact would differ between local versus central SOEs, as well as among commercial competition versus public welfare SOEs. This study provides an analytical framework for Western scholars to study corporate governance of SOEs in China.

N2  - The translation of passive into active representation assumes that bureaucrats are willing to serve the interest of their social group when developing and implementing policies. However, the assumption does not account for organizational socialization-the process of being taught what is important in an organization. In addition, there is a comparative paucity of theoretical and conceptual frameworks to explain why and how bureaucrats decide to become active representatives. In this study, I develop a framework for analyzing the decision to engage in active representation. The framework recognizes that active representation conflicts with organizational role and is based on the assumption of public choice theory that humans are utility maximizers. Bureaucrats are not totally devoted to active representation, but instead find an optimal point at which their self-interest is maximized in interrole conflict.

N2  - This article adopts a qualitative approach to investigate public service motivation (PSM) among the government employees in Hong Kong. The government employees are not a homogeneous whole but a nuanced combination of rational self-interested motives, and PSM may help to explain the entry reason as well as work efforts of government officials of various ranks and employment terms, different nature of work, postings as well as time periods. Various obstacles to the development of PSM among the different groups are found, and the means of encouraging PSM are discussed. However, it should be pointed out that the primary requirements for a government employee should be competence and a ``sense of responsibility{''} in carrying out the duties of the post concerned, while PSM serves only as an additional merit, indeed of secondary importance.

N2  - The decentralization process triggered by the Local Government Code of 1991 resulted in local politicians rising to the national political arena in the 2016 Philippine elections. A former mayor of Davao City was elected to the presidency and the widow of a former Naga City mayor to the vice presidency. These cases reflect various political dynamics, including bossism, patronage politics, a developmental authoritarian regime, and a grassroots democracy. Beyond typological studies on local politics, this chapter reveals the transforming nature of local politics by scru-tinizing policy making and policy implementation at the local level. Local policy makers become policy entrepreneurs when they find innovative ways to implement existing policies in particular local contexts or when they create new local policies. The policies may take on their own nature, or a built-in nature, via new institutions and changing expectations that outlast the term of political leaders. After reviewing conventional knowledge to understand the transforming nature of local politics, this chapter provides a brief case study of the coalition politics behind the Local Government Code of 1991. Policy coalitions—made up of politicians, bureaucrats, civil society activists, and businesspeople—work to make and implement policies at the national and local levels. ©Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University.

N2  - Hungary is a typical case of police reform within the context of political transition. For forty years, the police in Hungary had been a force serving the regime (rather than a service dedicated to citizen satisfaction). In the post-communist era, the Hungarian Police Force has been facing the task of restoring mutual trust with the population. A particularly urgent dimension of this task continues to be its relationship with ethnic minorities especially the Roma community, who remain the target of discrimination by public authorities and violence by some extremist groups. The Hungarian government, with the assistance of various partners such as the Helsinki Committee, the Open Society Institute and the European Commission, has undertaken several programs to address such problems. These include the STEPSS project to assess and reduce the number of discriminatory ID checks by the police; several managerial, recruitment and training efforts to improve the attitude of police officers towards the Roma; and - perhaps the most significant - the creation of a Community-Police Board in the Nograd County to establish a communication channel between the Police Force and local community (especially Roma) leaders. Overall, the paper argues that many interesting projects have been implemented in Hungary over the last 20 years and undeniable progress has been made. However, racist attacks, discriminatory practices against the Roma community within the police and under-policing of hate crimes remain serious long-term challenges.

N2  - The paper deals with lobbying, which it defines as a democratic means of promoting interests within society. Using a simple graphic model, it defines the basic ties in lobbying, which, in terms of economic theory, is viewed as a series of ties of a predominantly market nature, where the market concerned is the information market. The role of the Government, which is generally regarded as the central decision-making authority, mainly consists in creating a favourable institutional environment, which does not interfere with spontaneous market relationships However, there are certain situations that the Government could, or should regulate, and this paper discusses such situations using three hypothetical scenarios - a lobbying-free society, a society where lobbying exists, but is not transparent, and a society where lobbing is transparent. The conclusion discusses various regulation options.

N2  - The ranks and awards of Russian service elites and nobility have been a historiographical issue since the eighteenth century. G. F. Miller reflected on the psychology of the Tsar's subjects, who asked Peter the Great to keep some of the old ranks during the introduction of new ones and described two such cases. Soviet historians of the 1980s discovered several appointments to the old ranks made in the early eighteenth century and registered in archival documents. These curious cases were interpreted by researchers as isolated exceptions or the result of the inertia of old practices. The study of mass historical sources has since led to the discovery of more than 1100 cases of this kind and provided different contexts in which these awards were granted. It was previously thought that Tsar Peter ridiculed the old ranks, giving them only to his jesters. Modern research on Peter's innovations leads to a different view. For example, the introduction of the Hungarian dress and beard shaving was carried out in several steps, with backtracking. There has also been some oversimplification of the comparative pairs of epithets, such as "Muscovite-Imperial", "old-new", " and "boyars-nobility", which reflects nothing but the didactic attitudes of historians themselves. This article demonstrates that there was no dearth of official awards or withdrawal of the Duma ranks until the 1710s, at least. The introduction of The Table of Ranks did not abolish the ranks of "courtiers" (tsaredvortsy), as the earlier Muscovite ranks were called, which became the basis of the nobility. Peter I introduced several innovations to the traditional service hierarchy. Before the beginning of the Great Northern War, hundreds of the Tsarina's stol'niki and court servitors were transferred to the Muscovite ranks, following which the Zhiletsky List continued being replenished for some years afterwards. The drama of ranks was aggravated by the enhanced status of the regular army ranks, which were outside the Moskovsky Spisok (the hierarchy of traditional ranks). The course of events was accelerated by the Tsar's intention to implement European analogues of court and civil titles. Nevertheless, the popularity of the traditional ranks outside the army remained high. According to many sources, the traditional ranks of Muscovy were kept in check and re-registered throughout Peter's reign. The Tsar's decrees raised the status of military service. He sometimes approved petitions for the Duma ranks by several of his subjects and had his unique way of indicating the prospects for advancement to other petitioners. The low-level Muscovite ranks within the traditional hierarchy proved to be more stable than previously assumed. Muscovite ranks were not included in The Table of Ranks because the only rank of mass appointments by the early 1720s was that of a d'iak.

N2  - This study of the recruitment of top-ranking officers at the court of Peter the Great is achieved through analysis of rank assignment dynamics and the way in which the highest government bodies became institutionalized. The author takes into consideration the linguistic aspects and reliability of the court's records, which entails analysis of communications between the elite and the supreme power, and reconstruction of the mechanisms at play in individual appointments and daily control of service personnel. The article relies on two hitherto ignored or neglected representative source corpora. The first consists of late seventeenth-century boiarskie povestki, notifications to attend sessions of the tsar's council (boiarskaia duma) addressed to the hundred or so officials occupying the seven highest ranks; the second corpus consists of boiarskie spiski, annual boyar lists, dating from the years 1690-1714. These rolls constitute an extensive and detailed serial source allowing the historian to reconstruct individual careers and infer what the typical career path of the leading elite was. The combination of source study and prosopography allows the author to conclude that older control methods were in use until the promulgation of the Table of Ranks in 1722, that is, much later than generally thought by historians.

N2  - The paper focuses on the conceptualization of party patronage. The analysis of the usage of the term party patronage reveals several challenges: scholars from different fields use different definitions of party patronage, in addition same phenomena can be described by different concepts making it difficult to compare data from different surveys or analysis. Furthermore the term itself must be revised continuously as it can become out dated due to changing aspects of party patronage in modern world. To clarify the usage of term party patronage it is important to define contiguous phenomenon such as clientelism, politicization, state capture, pork barrel and corruption. Hence this paper suggests slightly modified conceptualization used by Kopecky et al.: party patronage as power of political parties to make personnel decisions in the public sector for Lithuanian social sciences. Party patronage is defined by three dimensions: who makes the decision, what are the decisions and where those decisions are made? In case of party patronage political parties acts as collective patrons and they make decisions of the personnel matter (hiring, promoting and transferring of public servants) in public sector. This conceptualization enables to show differences between party patronage and contiguous phenomenon. In short clientelism should be understood as an electoral resource of the political party, while party patronage should be understood as an organizational and governmental resource. Concept of politicization is closely connected to party patronage, however politicization is more suitable for public administrative studies as it is directed to the separation of bureaucrats and politicians while party patronage in political science puts attention on the political power of parties to make personal decisions. State capture is defined as systematic influence of business to government in order to obtain favorable legal and regulatory decisions. Pork barrel politics means direction of funding and legislation towards certain constituency or geographical region. Corruption should be understood as abuse of authority and power for personal gain.

N2  - The inspiration for this research is determined by the fact that leader integrity may have countless effects on organisations and employee performance. The research gap has focused on the antecedents of leader integrity within Iranian public services. This qualitative study used rich data from in-depth interviews and followed a Glaserian grounded theory as its research method. Results have suggested that, different factors influence leader integrity that include: individual characteristics (altruistic mindset, authenticity, organisational-based self-esteem, personal values that confer integrity, Machiavellianism), moderating factors (organisational: organisational climate regarding integrity, human resources management, whistleblower activities, organisational transparency and politicisation of bureaucracy) and moderating factors (managerial: leader job characteristics, leadership ability, expectations of leader performance, and ethical role model). We discuss a potential limitation of this study and implications for practice and directions for future research of leader integrity.

N2  - INTRODUCTION As I wait outside the office of a senior bureaucrat of the Finance Ministry of the Indian government in Delhi, I notice two impeccably dressed gentlemen waiting for him. Requesting them to wait even longer, the bureaucrat allows me into his office, and I silently thank my university affiliation and good luck for the priority I receive. After ushering me in, the bureaucrat volunteers that the people waiting outside are senior-level associates with a prominent Delhi-based corporate law firm. They had sought a meeting with him to justify why the private security agency that one of their foreign clients proposes to start in India deserved exemption from the protracted approval process that would otherwise have to be followed under the Indian foreign investment laws. If they succeed in making a case for exemption, it may well be a precedent for other foreign investors proposing to invest in a similar business format in future.This experience perhaps best describes the subject of this chapter by illustrating one of the many ways in which corporate law firms are influencing the country’s policy frameworks. Worldwide, scholars and the general population traditionally perceive the lawyer as an inherently political actor (Dezalay and Garth 2010; Krishnan 2013). Successful legal professionals often have relationships with government officials and political connections (Krishnan 2013). Although the Indian legal profession has been widely acclaimed for leading sociopolitical movements during the country’s Independence era, it has since been perceived as largely aloof from policy advocacy, having been accused of restricting its advocacy role to courtrooms (Galanter 1989; Krishnan 2003). The litigating bar is often applauded for limited policy outcomes achieved through public interest litigation (PIL) (Anant and Singh 2002; Krishnan 2003, 100; Perry-Kessaris 2008). The government also regularly consults senior lawyers, most notably the attorney general and the solicitor general, on proposed legislation.As documented in the Overview of this volume, until very recently the corporate bar constituted a small segment of the Indian legal profession. Moreover, it has been frequently criticized for its lethargy in policy activism (Krishnan 2010). The influence on law and policy of Washington law firms in the United States and Magic Circle firms in the United Kingdom and the eurozone has been extensively documented by the academia and media. © Cambridge University Press 2017.

N2  - This article seeks to reconcile congressional oversight models in theory with oversight realities in intelligence. For nearly three decades, political scientists have argued that Congress controls the bureaucracy - and in surprisingly efficient ways. Yet the history of intelligence oversight suggests the opposite. We take a fresh look at the logic and empirics of police patrol and fire alarm models and find that neither explains intelligence oversight well. Both rely on assumptions, such as the presence of strong and plentiful interest groups, which characterize domestic policy but not US intelligence policy. Our data - comparing committee hearing activities, legislative productivity, and interest groups across different policy domains between 1985 and 2005 - reveal that oversight varies dramatically by policy issue, and that intelligence almost always ranks at the bottom. Ironically, the same electoral incentives that generate robust oversight in some policy areas turn out to be far weaker in intelligence.

N2  - Fixers are ubiquitous, fostering institutional corruption and eroding public trust in government of developing as well as of Western political democracies. Paradoxically, the academic research of the forces upon which the phenomenon of 'fixers' feeds itself, the 'modus operandi' of fixers, the economic strain they put on individual and societal resources, and their negative effect on public integrity mainly in democratic governments, is still in its infancy. Most of the existing literature can best be described as a body of inconsistence- descriptive studies that loosely attempt to theorize on the general phenomenon. In an attempt to begin to understand the phenomenon of fixers more theoretically and less descriptively this chapter uniquely analyzes the phenomenon of fixers in view of three theories of bureaucratic corruption: 'network economy' theory; 'spillover' effect theory of corruption; and 'revisionist-functional' theory of corruption. The chapter suggests a theoretical framework for a typology of fixers, styles of their operation, the dynamics of the interface between them and civil servants, and policy measures to control the scope and negative effects of the phenomenon of fixers. The importance of studying the phenomenon of fixers, from the point of view of the international literature, emerges from it unique position as a major branch of mediation (including lobbying activity) in the one hand and as an important transmission mechanism to corruption on the other hand. Israel was chosen to demonstrate the subject of this chapter mainly because of the fact that, according to international indexes, the country status as a civil society has declined significantly over the past decade. According to the corruption index of Transparency International, Israel was ranked 30th in the world, at 2010, one of the lowest among the Western countries, having fallen from 14th in 1995. Using Israel as a case in point, the chapter shows that within certain national and local branches of government, fixers become as pervasive as to constitute a fear of creating a shadow copy of official institutions.

N2  - In electorally contested regimes, the incumbent party often uses clientelist exchanges to stay in power long after its underlying electoral support has evaporated. Existing studies failed to examine how the role of clientelism changes with the increasing tenure of the incumbent party. Combining data from the Afrobarometer project and information about partisan turnover, this article shows that the longer a party has remained in power, the more clientelist exchanges in the form of club goods and patronage will serve to bolster popular support for the ruling party. This is mainly because lengthy party duration facilitates the politicization of bureaucracy and other state resources essential for clientelist exchanges. Understanding the evolving role of clientelism under electoral contestation has profound implications for the study of phenomena such as dominant-party rule and democratic erosion.

N2  - This research explores the implications of nonprofit leaders' government ties for nonprofit operations and functions. Based on 81 survey questionnaires completed by civic environmental NGOs (eNGOs) in China and interviews with executives from 33 eNGOs, the authors examine the personal backgrounds of eNGO leaders and find that most Chinese civic eNGOs are connected with the government in one or more of three ways: political ties, service organization ties, or personal ties. Personal ties, or good guanxi with government officials, are positively associated with a higher level of funding stability and a more developed management system. Environmental NGOs with leaders who are current government officials or legislative body members are more likely to be engaged in policy advocacy. Service organization ties facilitate eNGOs' efforts to be engaged in legal services and to scale up to work on environmental issues at the national level. Moreover, an eNGO's policy advocacy engagement is associated with its ties with the nonprofit community.

N2  - Revisiting the enduring debate on meritocracy in late imperial Chinese history, LAWRENCE ZHANG examines the system of office purchase (juanna) and its effects on the composition and nature of Qing-dynasty officialdom. Through extensive quantitative analysis of the number of officials who purchased their way into the bureaucracy, and by weighing the costs and benefits of the juanna institution, Zhang argues that this institution was no less important than the civil service examinations in the recruitment of bureaucrats by the imperial center. Wealth was the key to unlocking this path of advancement and continued to play a role in the competition for success even among those who had already been certified as eligible for office. Those who purchased offices were given guarantees for appointments, an advantage that was afforded to no other group and opened up the possibility of hereditary office-holding among nationally prominent families.

N2  - Land fiscalization in China is a local development strategy intended to tilt the distribution of interests disproportionately toward local officials. We propose that the degree of power concentration among provincial Chinese leaders affects their need for support from lower-level bureaucrats. The more that power is dispersed among provincial leaders, the more they are incentivized to dispense benefits to local officials. To test this hypothesis, we used provincial-year panel data spanning 2003-2012 to examine how power concentration among provincial leaders affected land fiscalization within their jurisdictions. The empirical results robustly supported the hypothesis.

N2  - This study investigates how individuals participate in different modes of political participation via social networking sites (SNS) in China, where channels for participation are restricted and the online information flow is censored. A survey conducted at two large universities in southern China revealed that information exchange uses of SNS and SNS-based political activities were positively associated with the canonical mode of political participation-that is, contacting media and joining petitions and demonstrations. SNS-based political activities also positively predicted political engagement via private contacts, such as lobbying acquaintances of governmental officials, and facilitated political actions initiated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Affiliation with the CCP was found to be a significant predictor of the contacting-lobbying mode of participation and CCP-initiated political activities.

N2  - Vested interests have been blamed for resisting the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China. Yet, various interest groups have heterogeneous interests in privatization. Using both firm- A nd provincial-level data, we find that SOE managers and local bureaucrats-two key players of privatization-have contingent, rather than vested, interests in privatization, depending partly on their political connections with the central government. On the one hand, political connections motivate SOE managers to privatize more state ownership while retaining managerial control. On the other hand, central connections discourage provincial leaders from using privatization to boost their economic performance. These results shed light on the conditions under which China implements its economic reforms. With the increasing embeddedness and declining autonomy for policymakers, the once well-performing developmental state models now face serious challenges as politically powerful interest groups can manipulate economic reforms for their own purposes rather than for structural transformation.

N2  - Background: China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 after years of negotiations. As a WTO member, China had to reduce tariffs on imported cigarettes and remove non-tariff barriers to allow foreign cigarettes to be more competitive in the Chinese market. Among foreign tobacco companies, British American Tobacco (BAT) was the most active lobbyist during China's WTO negotiations. Objective: To review and analyse BAT's tactics and activities relating to China's entry into the WTO. Methods: Internal tobacco industry documents were reviewed and are featured here. Industry documents were searched mainly on the website of BAT's Guildford Depository and other documents' websites. 528 documents were evaluated and 142 were determined to be relevant to China's entry into the WTO. Results: BAT was extremely active during the progress of China's entry into the WTO. The company focused its lobbying efforts on two main players in the negotiations: the European Union (EU) and the US. Because of the negative moral and health issues related to tobacco, BAT did not seek public support from officials associated with the WTO negotiations. Instead, BAT lobbyists suggested that officials protect the interests of BAT by presenting the company's needs as similar to those of all European companies. During the negotiation process, BAT officials repeatedly spoke favourably of China's accession into the WTO, with the aim of presenting BAT as a facilitator in this process and of gaining preferential treatment from their Chinese competitor. Conclusions: BAT's activities clearly suggest that tobacco companies place their own interests above public health interests. Today, China struggles with issues of tobacco control that are aggravated by the aggressive practices of transnational tobacco companies, tobacco-tariff reductions and the huge number of smokers. For the tobacco-control movement to progress in China, health advocates must understand how foreign tobacco companies have undermined anti-tobacco activities by taking advantage of trade liberalisation policies. China should attach importance to public health and comprehensive tobacco-control policies and guarantee strong protection measures from national and international tobacco interests supported by international trade agreements.

N2  - The rights and social security of rural migrant workers have been addressed in China in recent years as a result of the work of government departments, international agencies and civil society organisations. This case study of the Social Support Network for Rural Migrant Workers in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, explores one such initiative, in a context in which civil society must operate within the framework of explicit political authorisation and official guidance. The case discusses how well-placed civil society actors were able to create a space for migrant workers' concerns, which included private sector service providers and the media as well as local government officials. Channels for communication, consultation and advocacy around migrant workers' rights have catalysed some important gains in the regime of service delivery for rural migrant workers.

N2  - Networks are increasingly found connected to and within bureaucracy in publicly regulated management systems. The constituent features are completely diametrical, however. The democratically legitimate authority, with hierarchical structures and defined social duties, encounters an open concept that is used by the various stakeholders as an infrastructure for communication and as a platform for their own interests. Therefore, a specific operational framework is required to utilize the potential positive dynamics of networks in the public sector. Cliques are more than an irritation; they are incompatible with democratically legitimate activities in the public sector.

N2  - This paper focuses on factors that have contributed to the persistence of forced child begging in Senegal. It interprets from a socio-cultural perspective the evolution and acceptance of an unremitting social phenomenon where talibes or Muslim child disciples beg on the streets of a now metropolitan Senegal. In seeking to highlight the fundamental causes of forced child begging, this paper draws on fieldwork and interviews with religious leaders, NGO representatives and Senegalese citizens. The paper then argues that there are four vital factors at the root of the perpetuation of the issue in question: parental motivation; the concept of alms giving; the lack of collaboration among various advocacy groups; and the lack of communication between government officials and religious leaders. These factors in their breadth allow for a macroscopic and exploratory analysis of the phenomenon of forced child begging and the implications of the problems it poses for the current state of Senegalese society. Finally, the paper aims to highlight how proposed solutions of engaging in forthright conversations about the controversial nature of the practice along with consolidating earnest efforts to put an end to it, can help lead to the termination of what has emerged as a modern human rights tragedy.

N2  - The involvement of civil society organizations with the HIV response, is arguably the largest ever seen in both breadth and depth. Never before have civil society organizations (CSOs) done so much to contribute to the fight against a global health crisis, or been so included in the decisions making process by policy-makers. The direct involvement of CSOs in the treatment and care of people living with HIV is partially related to the nature of the pandemic. Less tied to bureaucracy than the more institutionalized actors in domestic healthcare systems and intergovernmental organizations, CSOs operate more nimbly and are often better able to respond quickly to needs created by HIV. This can be true in the case of local CSOs, which are more attuned to the community, or international CSOs, which are able to transfer and employ global expertise and monetary resources better than many domestic health systems can do unaided. © Oxford University Press, 2006.

N1  - Author focuses on municipalities, but he also approaches how to measure professionalization.
N2  - This article develops an analysis of data on the professional status and educational background of public servants working in t he core administration of 5.5 thousand Brazilian municipalities. Taking ``public servants with higher education{''} as a proxy for identifying professional bureaucrats, we sought to determine the scale of participation in the municipal public service and the extent to which a greater proportion of servants recruited by means of an entrance exam, involving job stability and further education, may be associated with a greater chance of implementing an agenda of urban policies. The results indicate that even when controlled by demographic or electoral variables, the presence of professional bureaucracy served as a reliable link to an increased chance of introducing regulatory legislation on the urban space in Brazilian municipalities. Immune to electoral and governmental cycles, professional bureaucrats may utilize various technical and informative resources as well as political and organizational incentives for offsetting the decisions based on heavy political pressure generated by this kind of legislation.

N2  - As Professor Anne O'Connell has effectively documented, the delay in Senate confirmations has resulted in many vacant offices in the most senior levels of agencies, with potentially harmful consequences to agency implementation of statutory programs. This symposium contribution considers some of those consequences, as well as whether confirmation delays could conceivably have benefits for agencies. I note that confirmation delays are focused in the middle layer of political appointments-at the assistant secretary level, rather than at the cabinet head-so that formal functions and political oversight are unlikely to be halted altogether. Further, regulatory policy making and even agenda setting can depend more critically on the work of career civil servants than on the political leadership of an assistant secretary, further reducing the cost of midlevel vacancies. The Article then suggests that confirmation delays can have positive effects, although the list is short. Senior civil servants, serving as acting officials, can offer valuable expertise on regulatory decisions, and their expertise with respect to core implementation and enforcement issues may exceed that of more generalist political appointees. Additionally, confirmation delays may prompt both increased leadership by longtime civil servants and reduced turnover in their ranks, with benefits to overall agency function. On the other hand, confirmation delays surely cause significant problems by reducing resources to agencies and increasing turnover in management. Missing confirmed appointees also may contribute to slower White House regulatory review. More research is needed, but at a minimum, thinking about confirmation delays presents another opportunity to reflect on whether we should thin the layer of political management in agencies and on the relative importance, to administrative agency legitimacy and function, of specific expertise, compared with political accountability.

N2  - Few systematically assess the determinants of Medicaid nursing facility reimbursement. Consequently, this article examines what factors influenceprogram administrators'decisions regarding nursing facility cost report data - the basic information states use to establish payment. Whereas elected officials focus primarily on how much is spent on nursing homes, state Medicaid officials assume primary responsibility for the esoteric and highly technical dimensions that help make spending goals a reality. Findings indicate that the federal government influenced state policy by enabling provider litigation under the Boren Amendment. They also indicate that program administrators responded rationally to fiscal and economic concerns, and that states with stronger administrative capacity were better able to overcome obstacles to sustaining desired policies. Although results reveal that states with more powerful nursing home lobbies tended to implement more generous systems, they fail to reveal significant associations between cost report year and lobbying activity on behalf of the elderly.

N2  - While established in the Constitution as a means of filling key posts during long gaps between legislative sessions, recess appointments have recently become a common and essential tool for bypassing procedural hurdles in the Senate and maintaining adequate staffing in federal bureaucracies. Despite being ubiquitous in the past three decades, recess appointments may now be relegated to the status of constitutional relics. This development is due to the related trends of using pro forma congressional sessions to deny presidents an opportunity to issue recess appointments and the recent Senate precedent that all reduces the power of the filibuster on executive nominations. Now, depending on whether government is divided, presidents either cannot use or do not require recess appointments. This article explores the future prospects for recess appointments as well as the theoretical implications for the demise of this unilateral power.

N2  - Elections are among the most important and least understood institutions in contemporary authoritarian regimes. Theoretically, electoral authoritarian regimes should have an informational advantage that makes them more robust than other types of authoritarian regimes, but much empirical evidence suggests otherwise. In this article we offer a new perspective on why this might be the case. Specifically, we consider how authoritarian elections influence a ruler's choices in making cadre appointments. We argue that the imperative of winning authoritarian elections forces authoritarian leaders to prioritize the appointment of politically loyal cadres, who can help the regime win elections. This choice often comes at the expense of appointing officials who are competent at making good public policy and promoting economic development, factors that may contribute to long-term regime stability. We test this theory using an original dataset of gubernatorial appointments in one leading contemporary authoritarian regime, Russia.

N2  - In recent years, scholars have expended considerable efforts to understand the executive appointment process and the forces influencing the choices made by the president and the Senate. However, some factors integral to theoretical models have not been well integrated empirically, and other relevant factors have not been incorporated much at all. Here, we focus on one determinant corresponding to the former critique-nominee ideology-and another corresponding to the latter-the independence of decision makers in the targeted agencies. We examine a series of theoretically driven hypotheses regarding the effects of both ideology and independence on who gets nominated and if and when nominees are eventually confirmed. Results show nominee ideology and decision maker independence matter a great deal and factor into presidential strategic choices and senatorial responses in ways according to expectations. Our findings have important ramifications for understanding appointments empirically and for future theoretical development.

N2  - Studies on the Argentine public administration have usually underlined the weakness of Argentine state bureaucracies. On the basis of these assertions, scholars have tended to equate the number of state jobs with cases of patronage. By doing so, they have neglected the crucial issue of the scope of appointments effectively controlled by political parties. This article applies an innovative empirical inquiry to measure the extent of party patronage, assessing where, how deeply, and to what extent parties reach into the Argentine federal state structures. While the results by and large confirm the widespread notion of the broad scope of political appointments in Argentina, they re- fute the conventional hypothesis of a state thoroughly colonized by parties. Overall, the results suggest that parties' distribution of public jobs in the Argentine federal state is oriented less to mass-style patronage than to gaining effective and broad control over state institutions.

N2  - The responsiveness of government agencies to elected officials is a central question in democratic governance. A key source of variation in responsiveness is agency structure. Yet scholars often view agencies as falling into broad structural categories (e.g., cabinet departments or independent commissions) or fixate on some features of design (e.g., for cause protections). I develop new estimates of structural independence based on new data on 50 different structural features of 321 federal agencies in the federal executive establishment. Using a Bayesian latent variable model, I estimate independence on two dimensions: limits on the appointment of key agency decision makers and limits on political review of agency policy. I illustrate the value of this new measure by using it to examine how structure affects political influence and how agency independence can vary over time.

N2  - Lobby legislation and regulation in Canada are relatively new. The federal government was the first to enact lobby legislation in 1989, requiring only the most basic information. Eight provinces have since proclaimed lobby legislation and another has legislation pending. This article explores whether there was a common trajectory for lobby regulations and identifies the factors fostering similarity and differentiation. Using diffusion theory and the theory of institutional development, we attempt to explain the variation between jurisdictions in adopting particular democratic and ethical tools and approaches. We conclude that a particular and unique Canadian approach to lobby legislation benefitted from the creation of a network of federal and provincial officials across the country.

N2  - We analyzed the length of stay of the nominees for Senior Management and Advi-sory (in the acronym in Portuguese, DAS) positions in the Brazilian Federal Executive, from 1999 to 2017. The median duration in this type of position is 25 months and, at the top bureaucratic level, 23 months. About 30% of the nominees do not complete their first year of work and less than 30% of them remain in the same position for an entire presidential term. Factors such as the stability of ministers, affiliation to parties, belonging to federal careers, and place of work influence the chances of permanence of the nominees. The results contribute to unraveling the Brazilian Federal Executive’s working logic and its relationship with federative and party organizations. They also contribute to reflecting on ways to expand planning capacities and on the quality of the policy planning cycle by the public authority in charge. © 2022, Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Politicos (IESP), UERJ.

N2  - This paper studies the relationship between interest group political influence and allocation of decisionmaking power in a potentially divided government. We consider a simple endogenous policy model in which a legislator is in charge of setting the levels of two different policy instruments - a tax rate and a revenue redistribution scheme - and may decide to delegate policy authority over the allocation task to a bureaucracy within a hierarchy. An organized group is able to influence the political process at both tiers through the provision of policy-contingent contributions. We find conditions under which legislative delegation and sequential decisionmaking are consistent in equilibrium with the presence of two-tier lobbying, as the effects of the former on the allocation of lobbying activities exactly counterbalance the loss from bureaucracy's capture. As a consequence, we find that the possibility of multitier lobbying within a divided government need not be harmful to the higher level policy maker in the political equilibrium.

N2  - Under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995, as amended, individuals are required to register with the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate if they lobby either legislative or executive branch officials. In January 2009, Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner placed further restrictions on the ability of lobbyists to contact executive branch officials responsible for dispersing Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA, P.L. 110-243) funds. Subsequently, President Barack Obama and Peter Orszag, Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), issued a series of memoranda between March and July 2009 that govern communication between federally registered lobbyists and executive branch employees administering American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) funds. Most recently, in October 2009, the White House directed executive agencies to prohibit, when possible, the appointment of federally registered lobbyists to federal advisory bodies and committees. The Recovery and Reinvestment Act lobbying restrictions focus on both written and oral communications between lobbyists and executive branch officials. Pursuant to the President's memoranda, restrictions have been placed on certain kinds of oral and written interactions between federally registered lobbyists and executive branch officials responsible for Recovery Act fund disbursement. The President's memoranda require each agency to post summaries of oral and written contacts with lobbyists on dedicated agency websites. EESA regulations are virtually identical. This chapter outlines the development of registration requirements for lobbyists engaging executive branch officials since 1995. It also summarizes steps taken by the Obama Administration to limit and monitor lobbying of the executive branch; discusses the development and implementation of restrictions placed on lobbying for Recovery Act and EESA funds; examines the Obama Administration's decision to stop appointing lobbyists to federal advisory bodies and committees; considers third-party criticism of current executive branch lobbying policies; and provides options for possible modifications in current lobbying laws and practices.

N2  - This study analyses how information provided by different types of interest groups influences the ability of members of parliament (MPs) to accurately perceive the preferences of those citizens who voted them into office. To study how information provision by interest groups affects MPs’ perceptions, we combine unique data from a citizen survey and face-to-face meetings with 151 federal MPs in Switzerland, thus enabling a comparison of actual voter preferences with MPs’ estimations of these preferences. Ties to citizen groups, as self-reported by MPs in our survey, relate to more accurate perceptions by MPs, even when controlling for MPs’ partisan affiliation. Ties to business groups, as declared in the official registry, relate to less accurate perceptions. These findings suggest that interest groups can both tighten and weaken MPs’ link to their party voters, which might have repercussions on substantive representation and democratic accountability.

N2  - Studies in presidential appointments, particularly principal-agent models, posit that presidents employ a top-down strategy to control the bureaucracy, one that promotes loyalty over competence. However, many studies have two critical limitations: (1) treating loyalty and competence as binary constructs and (2) focusing only on presidential nomination and Senate confirmation (PAS) appointments. In this article, the authors construct a continuous measure of loyalty and competence to determine how much loyalty or competence an appointee offers a president and examine other appointment tools—Senior Executive Service (SES), Schedule C, and presidential appointments—that allow presidents to influence different levels of the bureaucracy. Findings show that presidents are more likely to reward competence with their PAS and SES appointments. In addition, few appointees score high on both loyalty and competence, explaining why presidents generally must make a trade-off between loyalty and competence.

N2  - Scholars have only begun to examine the roles played by non-career SES and Schedule C personnel in managing the bureaucracy. This, despite the fact that these individuals help to establish, communicate, and implement policy, and despite the broad discretion presidential administrations have in appointing them, defining their duties, and allocating their positions across the federal government. As an effort to redress this neglect, we first provide an overview of what lower-level political personnel do and of the processes and constraints that determine how they are distributed. We then examine how changes in presidential administration have affected the allocation of political SES and Schedule C positions across departments. Although dramatic infusions of these personnel into some agencies can be tied to policy objectives, they appear to be idiosyncratic and driven more by the preferences of agency leaders than by the White House. As such, they provide little support for positive theories that frame the administrative presidency in terms of centralized strategic planning.

N2  - We present a theory of the emergence and persistence of inefficient states based on patronage politics. The society consists of rich and poor. The rich are initially in power, but expect to transition to democracy, which will choose redistributive policies. Taxation requires the employment of bureaucrats. By choosing an inefficient state structure, the rich may be able to use patronage and capture democratic politics, so reducing the amount of redistribution in democracy. Moreover, the inefficient state creates its own constituency and tends to persist over time. Intuitively, an inefficient state structure creates more rents for bureaucrats than would an efficient one. When the poor come to power in democracy, they will reform the structure of the state to make it more efficient so that higher taxes can be collected at lower cost and with lower rents for bureaucrats. Anticipating this, when the society starts out with an inefficient organization of the state, bureaucrats support the rich, who set lower taxes but also provide rents to bureaucrats. We obtain that the rich-bureaucrats coalition may also expand the size of bureaucracy excessively so as to generate enough political support. The model shows that an equilibrium with an inefficient state is more likely to arise when there is greater income inequality, when bureaucratic rents take intermediate values, and when individuals are sufficiently forward-looking.

N2  - Background: Although public and media attention has focused on the federal role in the regulation of tobacco products, state government remains an important arena for changing tobacco control policies. Lobbying state officials by public health and the tobacco industry is a commonly used mechanism to influence public policy. Methods: Major bills of the 2007 - 2008 and 2009 - 2010 Wisconsin legislative sessions related to tobacco use regulation were analyzed by the hours engaged in lobbying and the estimated expenditures by supporters and opponents of tobacco control legislation in reports submitted to the Government Accountability Board. Results: In the 2007 - 2008 legislative session, anti-tobacco control organizations reported lobbying expenditures of more than $2 million (2627 hours) while opposing bills to raise tobacco excise taxes and enact smoke-free legislation; pro-tobacco control organizations reported lobbying expenditures of $623,000 (3997 hours) while supporting these bills. In the first 6 months of the 2009 session, anti-tobacco control groups spent $1.25 million (1472 hours) and pro-tobacco control groups spent $172,000 (1727 hours). Conclusion: In the 2007 - 2008 legislative session, the proposal to increase the tobacco tax by $1 per pack was passed. However, the smoke-free indoor air bill was defeated. Antitobacco control organizations outspent pro-tobacco control organizations by a margin of over 3:1. In 2009 anti-tobacco control groups outspent health groups by a ratio of 7:1. Legislation for smoke-free workplaces and an increase in the cigarette tax was enacted. However, funding for tobacco prevention and treatment programs was substantially reduced.

N1  - Exclusion criteria: 
- local government
- focus (turnover and quality of public services)
N2  - We study how political turnover in mayoral elections in Brazil affects public service provision by local governments. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design for close elections, we find that municipalities with a new party in office experience upheavals in the municipal bureaucracy: new personnel are appointed across multiple service sectors, and at both managerial and non-managerial levels. In education, the increase in the replacement rate of personnel in schools controlled by the municipal government is accompanied by test scores that are 0.05-0.08 standard deviations lower. In contrast, turnover of the mayor's party does not impact local (non-municipal) schools. These findings suggest that political turnover can adversely affect the quality of public services when the bureaucracy is not shielded from the political process.

N2  - This article explores the process of appointing government ministers and senior executive officials in Israel. It provides several case studies of the appointment process in the 1990s, a period of hyperfragmentation in the Israeli parliament. These studies reveal evidence of gross irresponsibility in the appointment process, as well as a lack of a meaningful oversight and checks in the process. One consequence is that the Israeli High Court was asked to intervene and review and reject a number of these appointments. The article argues that although well meaning, this intervention represents a dangerous new trend; this new role for the Courts is both inappropriate and counterproductive. It is inappropriate because judicial intervention imposes a legal solution when a political solution is called for, and it is counterproductive because frequent judicial intervention weakens both the judiciary and the political process. The article concludes with a proposal for an alternative approach to cope with the lack of meaningful oversight in the political-appointment process.

N2  - New scholarship in American politics argues that interest groups should be brought back to the center of the field. We attempt to further that agenda by exploring an aspect of group influence that has been little studied: the role interest groups play on the inside of government as official participants in bureaucratic decision-making. The challenges for research are formidable, but a fuller understanding of group influence in American politics requires that they be taken on. Here we carry out an exploratory analysis that focuses on the bureaucratic boards that govern public pensions. These are governance structures of enormous financial consequence for state governments, public workers, and taxpayers. They also make decisions that are quantitative (and comparable) in nature, and they usually grant official policymaking authority to a key interest group: public employees and their unions. Our analysis suggests that these "interest groups on the inside" do have influence - in ways that weaken effective government. Going forward, scholars should devote greater attention to how insider roles vary across agencies and groups, how groups exercise influence in these ways, how different governance structures shape their policy effects, and what it all means for our understanding of interest groups in American politics.

N2  - The pathologies of the presidential appointment process are well documented and include appointees' frequent lack of federal government work experience and their short appointment tenures. Less well understood are whether and to what extent these problems affect different subsets of high-level appointees, such as administrators in the environmental bureaucracy. Top-tier environmental appointees tend to stay longer in their appointed positions than do presidential appointees generally, and more than 40 percent have prior federal government management experience. These and other data suggest that key problems ascribed to the presidential appointment process are less salient in the case of high-level environmental appointees. Appointees in Republican and Democratic administrations have comparable levels of academic training and federal government experience. These similarities notwithstanding, White House expectations for appointees' political loyalty varies more from administration to administration. The Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush (first term) administrations maintained the highest demands for political loyalty, with consequences for the policy-administration dichotomy in environmental agencies.

It highlights how the analysis of administrative careers can provide answers to pertinent questions about the relationship between politics and administration, including civil service politicization, politicians' motivations in patronage decisions, the interplay of organizational characteristics and top officials' careers, and performance effects of administrative careers. It also includes suggestions on how to move forward in terms of research methods and how the systematic analysis of administrative careers can strengthen the comparative analysis of the relationship between politics and administration. © 2020 Tobias Bach, published by Sciendo.

N2  - The politicization of bureaucracy is a widespread strategy to increase the political control of ministerial departments in parliamentary democracies. It is, however, largely unknown why executive politicians promote some officials rather than others to high public office. Based on a unique dataset of all senior officials in German federal ministries and agencies that held office in the period 1997-2015, this article investigates whether partisan loyalty, political craft, and managerial competencies influence the chance of promotion to the highest civil service position in Germany (state secretary). We apply event history modeling to draw inferences on the relative importance of different selection criteria used by ministers when recruiting state secretaries from a candidate pool of senior officials. A key finding is that ministers consistently prefer politically loyal to nonloyal candidates. Although ministers also consider candidates' political craft and selected managerial competencies, they are likely to trade-off partisan loyalty against those qualifications. The article contributes to the literature on politicization in the public sector by comparing potential and actual office holders and by including a broad set of selection criteria, moving beyond the literature's dominating focus on partisan loyalty. The methodological approach developed in this article may well be transferred to other institutional contexts and used for comparative studies in this area.

N2  - This article examines the responsiveness of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to contacts initiated by members of Congress, interest groups, and private citizens. I develop and test hypotheses regarding the importance of internal bureaucratic factors (e.g., workload) and external political forces (e.g., contactor characteristics). Although previous research, which focuses on urban service bureaucracies, indicates that procedurally neutral rules related to agency missions are the primary predictors of responsiveness, I demonstrate that political considerations exerted substantial influence over HCFA responsiveness. For example, the agency was in some ways more responsive to congressional contacts than to contacts initiated by groups and citizens. These results suggest that scholars of legislative-executive relations should pay more attention to contacts as these routine, ongoing encounters may affect the extent to which bureaucratic policy choices are consistent with the preferences of elected officials and their constituents.

N2  - We propose that Congress controls the flow and content of information to the bureaucracy by creating federal advisory committees with membership rights for general categories of interests. We use data on the appointment of members to the National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC), an advisory committee within the Environmental Protection Agency, to test whether the active interests in the legislative debate over drinking water are represented on the advisory committee, and thus in the EPA's policymaking process, Although agency officials are responsible for appointing the members of NDWAC, we find that public endorsements by interest groups are influential in the agency's selection process. These groups provide reliable information to Congress about applicants' true policy preferences.

N2  - What government officials hear influences what they do. The processes of American governance-from the activities of interest groups and political parties to the often Byzantine operations of lawmakers-are readily penetrated by the strong, clear, and frequent political voices of privileged and highly active citizens. Differences in the abilities of individual citizens and groups to set the policy agenda, frame debates, and adapt to institutional processes prompts governing institutions to respond unevenly to the concerns and preferences of American citizens. Yet the governing process is not simply a mechanical cash register that tabulates the unequal political voices of the advantaged and organized. Entrenched institutional norms, patterns of behavior, and collective conceptions of purposes and goals interact with the struggle for political power among rival individuals and government bodies to prevent any single group or set of ideas from consistently steering government decisionmaking in one direction. The most persistent impact of stratified political participation is to reinforce the enduring bias of the American political process toward "deadlock and delay"-as the framers of the U.S. constitution and James Madison intended (Burns 1963). The recent growth in economic inequality appears to be increasing the power of individuals and groups who have a stake in doing little or nothing about substantially counteracting disparities based on income and wealth. American government is characterized by a level of individualization and lack of authoritative lines of control that makes it particularly ill suited to respond to a broad, aggregate phenomenon such as economic inequality by consistently enacting effective remedial policies. The American political process is geared toward particularistic, piecemeal issues rather than the big picture. Politicians and government may respond to the rising income and wealth of a small proportion of citizens in a thousand little (and not so little) ways, but they are not likely to consistently do so in one big way. Even if officeholders were generally motivated to enact egalitarian tax and spending policies to stem the rising tide of economic inequality, their efforts to significantly change these policies would likely run into the kind of collective action problems that have stalled efforts on environmental protection, heath care, and homeland security. The bias in the American political process toward inaction and responding to pressure from well-organized particularistic groups has created multiple and competing centers of influence and a corresponding patchwork of contradictory and incomplete economic and social welfare policies. One of the most demonstrable developments in the United States over the past half century has been the expansion of civil and political rights and, specifically, equality of opportunity in the economic realm and procedural equality in the political realm. Historically entrenched racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination has been challenged and the presence of previously underrepresented groups in the policymaking process has modestly expanded as a result. The ostensible aims of equity have been shaped, however, by the entrenched bias in the American political process to produce social rights for concrete and discrete groups such as seniors or the poor. The broader claims for establishing universal social rights and delivering substantive political and economic equality to all citizens lacked the intense support of powerful encompassing groups and institutional allies and clashed with the trajectory of American political development toward ensuring equality of opportunity more than equality of results. The consequence is that rising economic inequality has neither expanded nor reduced political inequality, nor even produced a dramatic redirection of overall government policy in the egalitarian or antiegalitarian direction. The pitched political battles over the past several decades and partisan cycles of frustrations and mobilizations have fueled the polarization of the Democratic and Republican parties and intimidated even the Democratic Party from energetically promoting the kind of egalitarian programs that some of its activists favor. This chapter-which is divided into four parts-is based on a review of existing research on American governing institutions, political organizations, and the making of public policy. Our review was undertaken with an eye to identifying continuity and change in who makes government policy, how, and to what effect. In particular, we examined research on whether and how political influences on government policy reflects enduring disparities in political voice and has changed as economic inequality has risen and long entrenched racial, ethnic, and gender inequalities have been challenged. We begin by acknowledging limitations on our efforts to evaluate the potential impact of unequal power in the making of public policy. The second section describes the broad institutional context of policymaking in the United States, including the complexities of the legislative process, federalism, and the nature of party politics. The third section outlines the role of interest groups and the impact of money in elections and in the policymaking process. The last section examines biases in political representation, with particular emphasis on whether patterns of unequal influence have altered in recent decades either with changing patterns of economic inequality or with expansions of civil and political rights.

N2  - Responding to recent articles in Governance highlighting the need for improved measurement of bureaucratic characteristics, this article describes efforts to map Brazil's federal agencies on three dimensions—capacity, autonomy, and partisan dominance—derived from data on more than 326,000 civil servants. The article provides a “proof of concept” about the utility of agency-level measures of these variables, demonstrating how they relate to an output common to all agencies: corruption. The article provides a first step in the direction of building a comparative research program that offers objective evaluation of bureaucracies within nation-states, with the intent of better disentangling their impact on governance outcomes.

N2  - This article develops an institutional spatial theory of presidential appointments to administrative agencies that falls within the spirit of a recent line of theoretical research toward an institutional theory of the presidency. We show that when bureaucrats implement policy that results from negotiation with constituents, the ally principle - appointing political allies - holds only as a knife-edge condition. Presidents are better served by appointing administrators whose preferences partially offset the influence of organized interests. The incentives described have implications for the selection of a whole range of bureaucratic personnel at various levels, generating significant implications for the study of public management on issues such as personnel administration, representative bureaucracy, and the devolution of administrative authority.

N2  - The ``congressional dominance'' literature in political science provides valuable insights into the legislative control of administrative agencies. However, this literature tends to be conceptualized with respect to regulatory agencies, and it is not especially helpful in understanding the dynamics of policymaking in the provision of human services. After distinguishing the tasks of regulation and human services provision, we present an alternative: a common agency model of human service policy as the outcome of interest group bargaining. We illustrate its implications with an analytic narrative of service provision for the seriously mentally ill.

This paper assesses this topic through trajectories and working practices of senior civil servants in French local governments. A mix of political sociology and of sociology of work, it focuses on generational patterns of political attitudes and thereby renews the thesis of ``politicized{''} public managers. It demonstrates that new patterns in careers increasing diploma requirements, fewer social mobility, increasing geographical mobility and decreasing steady employment contracts - result in less personalized relations toward politicians, although political screening remains strong.

N2  - The literature often contrasts interest groups possessing insider status and outsider groups forced to seek influence through more indirect means. Drawing on data from a survey of all national Danish interest groups, this article demonstrates that most groups have an action repertoire including both direct contacts to bureaucrats and parliamentarians and indirect activities such as media campaigns and mobilizations of members. Different strategies of influence are correlated positively, hence, there is no contradiction between pursuing strategies associated with insider access to decision-making and strategies where pressure is put on decision makers through media contacts and mobilizations. An analysis of four distinct strategies - an administrative, a parliamentary, a media and a mobilization strategy - finds interesting variations in the factors that affect the pursuance of the various strategies of influence. Groups with a privileged position vis-à-vis decision makers have high levels of activities targeting these decision makers, but the lack of a privileged position does not lead groups to pursue indirect strategies. Indirect strategies are most intensively pursued by cause groups and groups who find themselves in a competitive situation with regard to attracting members. © Political Studies Association, 2005.

N2  - The article compares the political activities of different types of interest groups. Drawing on data from a survey of all Danish national interest groups, it demonstrates significant variation in the strategic choices of different types of groups. Groups with corporative resources direct much attention towards influencing the bureaucracy. They possess resources valued by officials and therefore have good options for utilizing a strategy targeting the administration and seeking corporatist integration. By contrast, public interest groups are more likely to use publicly visible strategies in which affecting the media agenda plays a central role. By engaging in such strategies, public interest groups can demonstrate a high level of engagement to their diffuse membership. Furthermore, the goals of public interest groups are typically conducive to pursuit through public strategies. A third category of other groups is incorporated in the analyses as a point of reference to establish patterns of strategy use. While there are clear differences between groups with regard to most strategies of influence, different types of groups are equally engaged in a parliamentary strategy. Interacting with Parliament seems to be important for groups integrated in corporatist structures as well as for those relying more on public strategies. © 2008 Nordic Political Science Association.

N2  - A key issue for interest groups and policymakers is the ways through which organized interests voice their interests and influence public policy. This article combines two perspectives on interest group representation to explain patterns of interest group access to different political arenas. From a resource exchange perspective, it argues that access to different political arenas is discrete as it is determined by the match between the supply and demands of interest groups and gatekeepers-politicians, bureaucrats, and reporters. From a partly competing perspective, it is argued that access is cumulative and converges around wealthy and professionalized groups. Based on a large-scale investigation of group presence in Danish political arenas, the analyses show a pattern of privileged pluralism. This describes a system where multiple political arenas provide opportunities for multiple interests but where unequally distributed resources produce cumulative effects (i.e., the same groups have high levels of arena access).

N2  - Important conceptualizations of both interest groups and bureaucratic agencies suggest that these institutions provide legislatures with greater information for use in policy-making. Yet little is known about how these information Sources interact in the policy process as a whole. In this paper we consider this issue analytically, and develop a model of policy-making in which multiple sources of information - from the bureaucracy, an interest group, or a legislature's own in-house development can be brought to bear on policy. Lobbyists begin this process by selecting a venue - Congress or a standing bureaucracy - in which to press for a policy change. The main findings of the paper are that self-selection of lobbyists into different policy-making venues can be informative per se, and that this self-selection can make legislatures prefer delegation to ideologically distinct bureaucratic agents over ideologically close ones. Changes within the Federal Trade Commission during the 1970s are reinterpreted in the context of our model.

Although it refers to states (instead of the national level), it brings a comparative quantiative approach.
N2  - I study the consequences of interest group campaign contributions for administrative oversight. Unlike the few previous studies in this area, however, I study the influence in state bureaucracies and at the level of individual groups. Specifically, I test whether campaign contributions to state elected officials influence the outcomes of annual inspections of skilled nursing facilities in 16 states, leveraging the context of state politics in two important ways. First, I consider the differing effects of contributions to the legislative and executive branches. Second, I argue that legislative capacity for oversight influences the efficacy of contributions Regression analysis of inspection results with controls for facility characteristics provides evidence that contributing facilities have better overall inspection results, with a large reduction in citations for severe problems. Furthermore, contributions to legislators reduce overall problems, particularly in less professionalized legislatures, while those to the governor reduce severe ones.

N2  - During the past two generations, democratic forms have coexisted with massive increases in economic inequality in the United States and many other advanced democracies. Moreover, these new inequalities have primarily benefited the top 1 percent and even the top .01 percent. These groups seem sufficiently small that economic inequality could be held in check by political equality in the form of ``one person, one vote.'' In this paper, we explore five possible reasons why the US political system has failed to counterbalance rising inequality. First, both Republicans and many Democrats have experienced an ideological shift toward acceptance of a form of free market capitalism that offers less support for government provision of transfers, lower marginal tax rates for those with high incomes, and deregulation of a number of industries. Second, immigration and low turnout of the poor have combined to make the distribution of voters more weighted to high incomes than is the distribution of households. Third, rising real income and wealth has made a larger fraction of the population less attracted to turning to government for social insurance. Fourth, the rich have been able to use their resources to influence electoral, legislative, and regulatory processes through campaign contributions, lobbying, and revolving door employment of politicians and bureaucrats. Fifth, the political process is distorted by institutions that reduce the accountability of elected officials to the majority and hampered by institutions that combine with political polarization to create policy gridlock.

N2  - Accurate knowledge about societal conditions and public policies is an important public good in any polity, yet governments across the world differ dramatically in the extent to which they collect and publish such knowledge. This article develops and tests the argument that this variation to some extent can be traced to the degree of bureaucratic politicization in a polity. A politicized bureaucracy offers politicians greater opportunities to demand from bureaucratsand raises incentives for bureaucrats to supplypublic policy knowledge that is strategically biased or suppressed in a manner that benefits incumbents reputationally. Due to electoral competition, we suggest that the link between bureaucratic politicization and politicized policy knowledge will be stronger in democracies than in autocracies. A case analysis of Argentina's statistical agency lends credence to the underlying causal mechanism. Time-series cross-sectional analyses confirm the broader validity of the expectations and show that the relationship is present only in democracies.

N2  - This paper deals with double lobbying: several bureaucrats participate in joint lobbying to get a high total departmental budget, but they also engage in antagonistic lobbying to reap as high a share of the total budget as possible. The antagonistic lobbying constitutes a contest among the bureaucrats. This paper characterizes the Nash equilibria in lobbying and shows in which way exogenously fixed bureaucratic incomes induce the same or different lobbying behavior as incentive incomes.

N2  - Recent research suggests that there are two different types of lobbyists: those specializing in providing access to their personal connections with public office holders, and those specializing in a particular policy sector. This article advances this research by examining the actual behaviour of consultant lobbyists with data gathered from the Canadian Lobbyist Registry. Specifically, we probe two questions. First, using four indicators found within the literature, we investigate whether the behaviour of consultant lobbyists reflects the well-connected generalist or the issue specialist lobbyist. Second, we examine moving public office holders to see whether administrative officials – who make greater use of technical information – or politicians and partisan advisors – who are more interested in partisan/political information – are more likely to continue to be contacted by consultant lobbyists who contacted them in their previous position. Our results suggest that a more nuanced understanding of lobbying is required. While the majority of activities by consultant lobbyists are consistent with providing expertise to policymakers, a sizable minority of lobbyist activity is consistent with selling access to public office holders. Yet even here, our second analysis suggests that personal relationships may also involve the provision of expertise.

N2  - The literature offers individually valid yet collectively inconsistent hypotheses concerning the nature of public agencies' responsiveness to interest groups. This article analyzes the nature of this responsiveness by examining the brokerage potential of public agencies among interest groups. Such a brokerage potential is hypothesized to follow from agencies' preferences for policy goods as well as the tendency of interest groups to seek access to public agencies. It combines analyses of agencies' demand for policy goods with interest groups preferences for seeking access to specific policy venues. The analyses are based on survey data of national civil servants and interest groups in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands. The findings suggest that both strategic preferences as well as organizational routines positively correlate with a brokerage potential while interaction patterns within and with the organizational environment of public agencies can constrain their brokerage potential in several distinct ways.

N2  - We study, theoretically and empirically, legislative influence over executive agencies, focusing on the breadth of agency responsibilities. We model interest groups, the legislature, and agencies. Politicians exert costly effort to influence agencies in exchange for interest groups' campaign contributions. Effort, however, can only be imperfectly targeted. When effort is spent on behalf of one group, some spills over to benefit other interest groups. This creates externalities of influence that are larger in broad agencies, deterring legislative influence. Empirically, we develop a novel lobbying-based measure of breadth and combine it with survey data on influence in 70 US federal agencies. Broad agencies report less influence, and we rule out several alternative explanations. These results are important for understanding how to insulate divisive tasks from political influence. .

N2  - Available evidence indicates that there is considerable variation among autocracies in the extent to which subnational officials are rewarded for economic growth. Why is economic performance used as a criterion for appointment in some autocracies but not in others? We argue that in more competitive though still autocratic regimes, the political imperatives of maintaining an electoral machine that can win semi-competitive elections leads regime leaders to abandon cadre policies that promote economic development. Using data on turnover among high-level economic bureaucrats in Russia's 89 regions between 2001 and 2012, we find that performance-based appointments are more frequent in less competitive regions. These findings demonstrate one way that semi-competitive elections can actually undermine economic development under autocracy.

N2  - This article considers the direct impact of political parties, interest groups, and social movement organizations (SMOs) on policy, providing evidence for a "core" hypothesis and three others that refine or qualify it. The core hypothesis: all three types of organizations have substantial impacts on policy. The other three: (1) when public opinion is taken into account, the political organizations do not have such an impact; (2) parties have a greater impact than interest groups and SMOs; and (3) interest groups and SMOs will affect policy only to the extent that their activities provide elected officials with information and resources relevant to their election campaigns. The source of data is articles published in major sociology and political science journals from 1990 to 2000, systematically coded to record the impact of organizations on policy. The major findings include: political organizations affect policy no more than half the time; parties and nonparty organizations affect policy about equally often; there is some evidence that organizational activities that respond to the electoral concerns of elected officials are especially likely to have an impact.

N2  - What explains different levels of clientelism across countries? Why do some politicians deliver clientelistic goods to their electoral constituencies, and why do some voters demand them? This article focuses on the historical origins of trust in states and shows that they have a lasting impact on contemporary patterns of patronage. The shift to programmatic politics reflects a historical transition from personalized trust in politicians to trust in impersonal bureaucracies tasked by political parties to implement policy. Past experience with public bureaucracy informs the expectations of voters and parties regarding the performance of the state and its ability to provide public goods, which in turn shape the degree of clientelistic exchange across societies. To capture state capacity, the authors focus on the critical juncture before the expansion of women's suffrage, and use the ability of public bureaucracies to reduce infant mortality in the interwar period as a proxy for historical state capacity and as an instrument to predict trust. Macrodata from eightyeight electoral democracies and microdata from the most recent wave of the World Value Survey provide supportive evidence for the theory.

N2  - This article explores the material practices through which lower-caste and poor villagers engage with bureaucracy in contemporary India. We take documents and paperwork - such as ration cards and community certificates - as a `lens' through which to explore how paper materiality is infused with the politics of power, patronage, and identity. The article brings ethnography from rural Tamil Nadu, South India, in conversation with two bodies of literature: one on the materiality of bureaucracy and one on the nature of political mediation in contemporary India. We demonstrate how everyday engagements with paperwork as well as processes of applying, form filling, and securing recommendations are constitutive of social and political relationships and, ultimately, of citizenship itself. Political mediation around paperwork and bureaucracy generates a hierarchy of citizens rather than equal citizenship for all, yet ordinary villagers transpire as anything but passive. Drawing on patronage networks, engaging in affective performances, and navigating a politics of identity, they actively negotiate access to the state in an attempt to claim their rights as citizens.

N2  - This paper argues that South Africa suffered a major democratic reversal after the election of Jacob Zuma as president of the country in 2009, especially from 2012 when the project of Radical Economic Transformation was pursued with vigour in State Owned Companies (SOEs).This reversal was invisible theoretically. Contemporary definitions of democracy, especially as they inform the literature on political transitions, reduce the phenomenon to the rules of political participation. Yet over the last ten years South Africa saw, not so much a rolling back of political rights as concerted attacks on the autonomy of state administrations. Without the conceptual tools to understand these attacks on the bureaucracy as attacks on democracy, the period from 2007 to 2017 has largely been construed in terms of corruption, criminality and patronage. This paper adds a new typology to democratic theory, reconciling a concept from public administration to democratic theory. It argues that we must think of bureaucratic autonomy as a democratic virtue.

N2  - In all modern bureaucracies, politicians retain some discretion in public employment decisions, which may lead to frictions in the selection process if political connections substitute for individual competence. Relying on detailed matched employer- employee data on the universe of public employees in Brazil over 1997-2014, and on a regression discontinuity design in close electoral races, we establish three main findings. First, political connections are a key and quantitatively large determinant of employment in public organizations, for both bureaucrats and frontline providers. Second, patronage is an important mechanism behind this result. Third, political considerations lead to the selection of less competent individuals.

N2  - It is frequently claimed within the politicization literature that while governments around the world are increasingly politicizing senior public service appointments, the nature and extent of this politicization varies across administrative traditions. To date, however, differences across administrative traditions have received little empirical scrutiny; research tends to be more comparable than comparative. Using data from an expert survey systematically measuring the merit-, political-, and personal-recruitment of senior public servants in 20 countries, this article examines differences across and within the Nordic, Westminster, Germanic and Napoleonic administrative traditions, in addition to the alternative Anglo-American and Southern European traditions. Various tests show meaningful variation in politicization across administrative traditions, with the starkest differences found between the Nordic and Napoleonic traditions. The results also show less variation among the countries comprising the Nordic tradition than that found within the other traditions.

N2  - Recruiting civil servants on the basis of merit is believed to improve the quality of governance because it increases the bureaucracy's expertise, leads bureaucrats to develop distinct preferences and encourages them to candidly voice their opinions to others. Yet, to date, the reason why merit recruitment positively affects employee voice remains theoretically vague and has received little empirical scrutiny. This article advances this research by theoretically specifying why merit recruitment positively affects employee voice, and by empirically testing this association with survey data measuring the perceptions of federal civil servants in Canada. Controlling for several additional factors believed to influence employee voice, the results from various multivariate regression models show a robust and statistically significant association between merit recruitment and fear to voice a dissenting opinion. The more civil servants believe that merit recruitment is high, the less they fear reprisal for expressing a dissenting opinion to their superiors.

N2  - Does political uncertainty affect whether lobbyists contact government officials? We suggest that the answer depends on the type of uncertainty introduced. Distinguishing between policy objective uncertainty—where organized interests and lobbyists are uncertain about the policy intentions of decision makers—and issue information uncertainty—where policymakers are uncertain about the technical details of issues—we hypothesize that whereas an increase in policy objective uncertainty leads to a decrease in lobbying, a rise in issue information uncertainty leads to more lobbying. We test the hypotheses with longitudinal data from the Canadian Lobbyists Registry measuring change in the number of times lobbyists have contacted government ministries each month from 2008 to 2018. The results suggest that lobbying intensity does respond differently to these types of uncertainty. Whereas events introducing issue information uncertainty have a statistically significant positive relationship with lobbying, events introducing policy objective uncertainty do not.

N2  - This article suggests that key bureaucrats play a decisive role in times of welfare crisis. It argues that key bureaucrats, through their advice, define both the type of welfare crisis and the range of possible solutions, which have at least two important consequences: First, it broadens the distribution of welfare cuts, as key bureaucrats-contrary to politicians-have no interests in targeting special voter groups. Second, it enables political compromises, as both the government and the opposition trust the key bureaucrats' expertise. These suggestions are tested empirically in a case study of Sweden in the 1990s. It shows that key bureaucrats did indeed influence both the distribution of the cuts and enabled a compromise between the center-right government and the Social Democratic opposition.

N2  - When things in the public domain go wrong, government bureaucracies usually face increased political scrutiny and strong demands for reform. The need for organizational learning is high under such circumstances. Conventional theories, however, conceive political involvement as a constraint on organizational learning. This implies a paradoxical challenge for public organizations. On the one hand, the need to learn from mistakes is highest in times of political scrutiny; on the other hand, under such conditions learning is presumed to be most difficult. After studying the effects of politicization on organizational learning in detail, we come to the conclusion that this notion is incomplete at best. Learning in public organizations depends not so much on political involvement as such but, rather, on the specific characteristics of that involvement. Politicians may influence learning processes positively if they commit to structural solutions and encourage the institutionalization of organizational lessons.

N2  - Overall, within the broad descriptive framework of the comparative-elites study, the special impact of New Public Management (NPM) on the German federal government is considered, but judged marginal. The man-darin status of the administrative elite prevails, despite a long-term decrease in the share of jurists and more open career patterns, both due to a first managerialist turn in the 1970s. It is argued that new administrative policies are carried out like any other substantive policy. On the polity dimension, the bureaucracy's function as the center of expertise is reflected in terms of both formal education and subjective role understanding. On the policy dimension, the 1970 reformist agenda of the Brandt government resulted in higher programmatic commitment than at the point of replication of the base line study in 1987, when the Kohl government was consolidating public finances. Under conditions such as those prevailing after national unification in 1990 and since about 1995, though, top administrators can turn quite managerial. The most significant change is observed on the politics dimension: growing party politicization of the administrative elite, in particular after fundamental government changes (1969, 1982, 1998) examined here. Functional as it may be for streamlining the ministries, the extent of party patronage may, in the long run, undermine the still-high trust in executive institutions in Germany.

Art. 16 of the Staff Regulations (SR) provides for an obligation to declare activities after leaving the service and for the possibility of banning or restricting some of them. Is Art. 16 of the Staff Regulations a sufficient basis in order to avoid any potential conflict of interest? Is Art. 16(3), which prevents senior officials from lobbying their own institution after leaving the service efficiently applied?

N2  - The Belgian civil service used to be a Weberian bureaucracy, with a strict division of labor between civil servants and politicians, administrative careers based on both seniority and partisan patronage, and a technocratic culture coupled with a high level of alienation from both politics and politicians. Administrative reform came in the wake of the constitutional reform that transformed unitary Belgium into a federal state with several governments, each with a civil service of its own. The fiscal crisis prompted them to look favorably on the promises of New Public Management (NPM). The new Flemish government was first to take advantage of this opportunity, as it had the financial resources, the tendency to refer to Anglo-Saxon and Dutch examples, and the right political and administrative leadership. The staying power of these as yet precarious reforms depends on the continuity of political leadership, the establishment of an administrative culture matching the institutional innovations, and resistance to the endemic temptation to use them for partisan purposes.

N2  - If presidents wish to see their policy priorities implemented, they need control over key decision-making positions often occupied by career executives. This article examines whether political conflict with a new administration drives career executives from their positions. This can happen because presidents target specific individuals or because career professionals anticipate conflict and strategically exit before a new president takes office. To assess this dynamic, we use novel data that combine individual survey responses with personnel records to analyze the probability that an agency executive departs her position from March 2015 to July 2017. Given our findings that turnover is driven by both presidential marginalization and strategic exit by bureaucrats, we conclude with implications for presidential efforts to control the bureaucracy.

N2  - It has been accepted for a long time that ministries use external support during the lawmaking process. When the Ministry of Economics delegated the drafting of an entire bill to a private law firm, concerns about governmental capacity and an intransparent route of access for special interests have been raised. The empirical analysis of delegated law drafting and temporary employment of experts, seconded from business firms and interest groups to ministries, shows that both phenomena remain small in scale and therefore of limited impact. By looking at the reasons why there is a "law drafting by contract" at all, it is revealed that not all German ministries are sufficiently staffed with qualified personnel to deal with more complex and innovative subjects of legislation. Given the high expectations which are addressed at government sovereignty during the lawmaking process, this appears as an unresolved problem of policy-making in the German political system.

N2  - The Northcote-Trevelyan Report (1854) recommended fundamental changes to public policy which included the replacement of patronage by examination as the basis for recruitment to the British Civil Service and of seniority by merit as the foundation for promotion decisions. This paper examines the accounting dimension of reforms designed to achieve enhanced administrative efficiency and greater economy in the operation of government departments. A growing interest in the role of accounting within British government during the second quarter of the nineteenth century is elucidated, and prevailing ideas concerning how accounting within government departments and accountability from the executive to parliament might be performed more efficiently and effectively are uncovered. The battle between divergent pressure groups concerning who should possess jurisdiction over accounting work is explored, and the solution to this problematic is found to connect with the nature of a central government accounting system that was itself undergoing significant change. Consistency between the Northcote-Trevelyan recommendations and ongoing internal initiatives designed to ensure the competence of clerks recruited to undertake accounting work and subsequently applying for promotion to a higher grade is demonstrated.

N2  - In the two-stage political-economic game that we study public policy is the outcome of the interaction between interest groups and a two-tier government. Implementation of a policy proposed by a bureaucrat requires approval by an elected politician. The objective function of the bureaucrat hinges on the weight assigned to social welfare relative to the rent-seeking outlays of the interest groups. This weight represents the degree of politicization of the government. Our main result is that, in contrast to common belief, increased politicization need not adversely affect the public well-being.

The efforts of some inside the agency to institutionalize rational decision-making models, partly in response to new environmental law, expanded the number and range of interest groups that participated in its decisions by incorporating their preferences into their models for evaluating plans. But the terms under which people could express their values and interests were strictly controlled in ways that some felt misrepresented their concerns. How we conceive of rationality has important implications for how and which people are included in bureaucratic decision making.

N2  - This article investigates causes of the legislative choice to mobilize private litigants to enforce statutes. It specifies the statutory mechanism, grounded in economic incentives, that Congress uses to do so, and presents a theoretical framework for understanding how certain characteristics of separation of powers structures, particularly conflict between Congress and the president over control of the bureaucracy, drive legislative production of this mechanism. Using new and original historical data, the article presents the first empirical model of the legislative choice to mobilize private litigants, covering the years 1887 to 2004. The findings provide robust support for the proposition that interbranch conflict between Congress and the president is a powerful cause of congressional enactment of incentives to mobilize private litigants. Higher risk of electoral losses by the majority party, Democratic control of Congress, and demand by issue-oriented interest groups are also significant predictors of congressional enactment of such incentives.

N2  - Current trends in the U.S. political system threaten an increase in patronage and a return to the political problems of the 1800s. Modern-day patronage is strongly related to two popular efforts to reform government: the rollback of the civil service system and the privatization of government services. These reforms, aimed at reducing the negative outcomes of bureaucracy, have had the unfortunate outcome of eliminating policies designed to protect civil servants from patronage politics and thus of ultimately reducing democratic accountability. Whether the main cause is forgetfulness about the past or simply the application of misguided principles, the dismantling of the civil service and increasing reliance on private contractors can endanger public values and the ability to engage in a thoughtful debate about public values. Professionalism in government—including civil service, open competition for jobs and contracts, and merit systems—remains the most effective and just means for combating patronage and identifying talented, dedicated public servants and contractors.

N2  - Building on agency-theoretical perspectives of public bureaucracies, we argue that politician-bureaucrat preference alignment can have important implications for bureaucrats' pay. We study such private gains to bureaucrats from their political alignment with elected politicians using detailed data on all 1,632 top administrators active in all Norwegian municipalities over a period of 25 years (1991-2015). Whereas existing studies generally rely on proxies for politician-bureaucrat political alignment, a rare feature of our data allows measuring it directly since 27% of top bureaucrats ran for political office. We focus explicitly on individuals at the very top of the administrative hierarchy and are able to separate the intensive margin (i.e., wage increases) from any additional effects at the extensive margin (i.e., new appointments). Using close elections for inference in a regression discontinuity analysis, we find that politician-bureaucrat alignment significantly increases top bureaucrats' wage even in the Norwegian civil service system. This has important implications also from a theoretical perspective. Our results indeed go against predictions from models with policy-motivated bureaucrats, but are consistent with politically aligned principal-agent matches being more productive.

N2  - Government policies can activate a political constituency not only by providing material resources to, or altering the interpretive experiences of, individual citizens, but also by directly subsidizing established interest groups. We argue that state laws mandating collective bargaining for public employees provided organizational subsidies to public sector labor unions that lowered the costs of mobilizing their members to political action. Exploiting variation in the timing of laws across the states and using data on the political participation of public school teachers from 1956 to 2004, we find that the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law significantly boosted subsequent political participation among teachers. We also identify increased contact from organized groups seeking to mobilize teachers as a likely mechanism that explains this finding. These results have important implications for the current debate over collective bargaining rights and for our understanding of policy feedback, political parties and interest groups, and the bureaucracy.

N2  - This paper analyses the patterns of bureaucratic tenure of the German federal bureaucratic elite. It applies a delegation theory and a Public Service Bargain perspective and argues that partisan and professional determinants influence the bureaucratic tenure. Our survival analysis shows that partisan features matter, yet differently than suggested by existing research: top officials affiliated with the minister's party have a significant higher risk of dismissal than those affiliated to other parties and non-partisans. In contrast, the temporal proximity between ministerial and top official appointments has no significant effects on bureaucratic tenure. In addition, professional determinants shape bureaucratic survival. Whereas the minister's office experience is insignificant for bureaucratic survival, the top official's office experience has significant and negative effects on the risk of dismissal: individuals with prior experience in managing bureaucratic apparatuses survive longer than those without such office experience. We conclude that German ministers are more likely to dismiss senior civil servants due to their unsatisfying office experience than their incongruent or lacking partisan affiliation. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Flowing out of wider debates regarding representative democracy, the diversity of political institutions has gained salience. Normatively, it is suggested that it is simply unfair for white, middle-aged males to dominate decision-making structures. Instead it has been argued that representative diversity can enhance the legitimacy of political institutions and processes, whilst improving the quality and inclusivity of policy-making. Although most of these arguments have been applied to elected institutions and their bureaucracies, they are also germane in the context of appointments to the boards of public bodies, as the work of these bodies and the decisions made by their board members impacts upon the everyday lives of citizens. Drawing upon original research conducted in the UK, this article argues that the capacity of political actors to make appointments to public boards offers an as yet unrealized democratic potential by offering more opportunities for social engagement and participation in public governance. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - CENTRAL TO THE POST-COMMUNIST TRANSFORMATION is a redefinition of relations between business and the state. This redefinition has been particularly difficult in Russia, where policy makers and scholars alike have cited an incestuous relationship between business and the state as a key impediment to an orderly market economy. However, we have few empirical studies of business lobbying in Russia. Views about lobbying are extensively coloured by writings about the oligarchs-a small group of powerful industrialists and financiers that is by definition atypical. In addition, analyses of lobbying tend to focus on sectors or regions rather than firms. Most important, discussions of business-state relations in the region tend to concentrate on successful lobbyists and ignore firms that are not influential. By examining only cases where firms influence policy, observers risk distorting perceptions of the extent and significance of lobbying. This article examines business lobbying in Russia using an original survey of 500 firms conducted between October and December 2000 in eight cities and presents three findings. First, the sources of lobbying power vary by level of government and by type of firm. While large firms claim to be able to influence legislation at all levels of government, the impact of property type-whether a firm is state-owned, privatised or de novo private-varies by level of government. Property type matters little for lobbying the federal or municipal governments, but at the regional level state-owned firms are more successful and de novo private firms are less successful lobbyists than privatised firms. This suggests that efforts to tailor policies to level the economic playing field in Russia should focus on the regional level of government. Second, successful lobbyists use a variety of means to influence legislation. As expected, personal consultations with state agents are a valuable tool for firms. More surprising, half of the successful lobbyists in the sample relied on a business organisation to obtain favourable legislation for their firm, suggesting that business lobbying in Russia may be somewhat more institutionalised than is commonly recognised. Third, relations between influential firms and the state are better characterised by elite exchange than by pure capture. Successful lobbyists are more likely to get direct benefits, such as subsidies or tax breaks, from the state. However, they are also more likely to be subject to price controls and are inspected more frequently than other firms in the sample. As price controls and inspections provide benefits for politicians and bureaucrats, state officials also gain from granting individual firms influence over legislation and other normative acts. These results also indicate that business-state relations in Russia are less one-sided in favour of business than is commonly argued.

N2  - We investigate how aspects of "civil service" systems of personnel management interact with bureaucratic discretion to create expert bureaucracies populated by policy-motivated agents. We construct a dynamic model in which bureaucrats may invest in (relationship-specific) policy expertise and may or may not be interested in policy choices per se. The legislature makes sequentially rational grants of discretion, which serve as incentives for expertise investment and continued service only for policy-motivated bureaucrats. Bureaucratic policy preferences and the legislature's agency problem vis-à-vis bureaucracies develop endogenously in the model. Bureaucratic expertise can be supported in equilibrium only at a cost of its politicization; "neutral competence" is inconsistent with strategic incentives of bureaucrats. We identify several conditions that support the development of an expert bureaucracy in equilibrium, including security of job tenure and control over policy issues for policy-motivated bureaucrats.

N2  - We develop a model of notice and comment rulemaking, focussing on strategic issues facing agencies and interest groups in light of judicial review in this process. Specifically, we analyse the incentives for agencies and groups to produce and reveal information during rulemaking. We show that judicial review can produce informed policymaking, but that participatory rulemaking can bias agency policymaking in favour of groups with access to the rule-making process. In addition, the model allows an analysis of doctrines of judicial review of agency policymaking. The model reveals that politicised judicial review can be beneficial because of its effects on agency incentives for information acquisition in policymaking. Accordingly, socially optimal judicial review may be legally irrational and, contrary to standard doctrines of judicial review in the United States, judicial deference to rules with thin records can be optimal.

*local (evaluate again)
N2  - The worlds of local bureaucrats are under researched and under theorized compared with those of civil servants in core executives. Yet local bureaucratic elites, sitting as they do between central states and localities, are key actors in governance networks. In England, the role and responsibilities of local bureaucratic elites has been transformed since the days of professionalized officers heading departmental structures reporting to committees, firstly by NPM and politicization in the 1980s and 1990s and, more recently, by political management reform introducing a separation of powers. Drawing on interviews in 15 local authorities, this paper examines the changing narratives and dilemmas of local government elites. In particular it explores, but argues against, early expectations that the creation of an elected executive, with considerable devolution of decision-making responsibilities to individual cabinet member councillors, has meant a move closer to the logics of the 'Whitehall mandarin' tradition by local government chief officers.

N2  - This article examines the relationship between the legislature and the public administration in postwar Italy (understood as the period from about 1948 through 1994). Italian public administration is normally characterized as badly designed and inefficient, and government performance is usually classed as poor. I argue by contrast that bureaucratic inefficiency, excessive legislation and widespread bureaucratic corruption were features of Italian public administration that were deliberately designed by legislators and intended to enhance the re-election prospects for incumbents by providing them with opportunities for extensive constituency service. The underlying incentives stemmed from the candidates' search for the personal vote, essential for retaining public office. Differences in the laws regulating the financing of political campaigns explain why excessive bureaucratization in the Italian context also resulted in extensive political corruption.

N2  - A business enterprise interested in influencing the design, adoption or enforcement of a particular law, rule or regulation often confronts a choice. Does it lobby officials directly? Or does it do so indirectly, using a collective action group as an intermediary? We draw on data from a large, 2010 survey of enterprises across the Russian Federation to demonstrate that the propensity to engage in intermediated lobbying increases with region-level political competition. Our explanation builds on recent evidence confirming Mancur Olson's claim (1982) that less encompassing actors tend to lobby for more distortionary policies. We hypothesize that with greater political competition government officials become more responsive to encompassing voices (i.e. associations of businesses as opposed to single firms), since the electoral costs of being captured by narrower interests becomes greater. Evidence from a complementary survey of regional business association managers points in the same direction; the relative attention paid by officials to lobbying efforts by encompassing associations increases with political competition.

N1  - exclusion criteria: it focuses mainly on street-level bureaucrats (teachers)
N2  - Objective. Two tacks are implicit in the seminal Chubb and Moe (1990) argument that education bureaucracies tend to be rigidified by democratic conflict. One emphasizes the vulnerability of urban systems to organized interests and community pressures; the other argues that urban systems are unresponsive and ossified bureaucracies. This debate contrasts with traditional assumptions of apolitical ``professionalism.'' The predictive power of these theses is examined for the case of school violence prevention policy. Methods. Ordinary least squares regression analysis is conducted on the 1995 Council of Urban Boards of Education survey, encompassing 74 urban school districts. Results. Districts with greater levels of racial violence and violence against teachers had more school violence prevention measures. Levels of general school violence and district perceptions of school violence were not statistically significant. Conclusions. Urban systems are quite responsive to interest group pressure as well as to high SES communities. The professionalism thesis is not supported.

N2  - Governments face a fundamental dilemma when asking expert groups for advice. Experts possess knowledge that can help governments design effective and legitimate policies. However, they can also propose different policies than those preferred by government. How do governments solve this conundrum? Through a mixed-methods study, the article examines politico-administrative control with expert advisory commissions in Norway. Arguing that both politicians and bureaucrats can take interest in limiting the gap between political/administrative policy preferences and expert group output, the article examines by what means they seek to control expert groups and how control varies across policy portfolios. It finds that while politicians rely on control by design, bureaucrats use both design and interventions. Moreover, political and bureaucratic controls are stronger in the area of financial/economic policy than elsewhere. The article makes a novel contribution to scholarship at the intersection of public administration and knowledge and policymaking.

N2  - Formal models of the appointments process typically cast the decision of the appointing executive as one where an open position is assumed and an appointee is chosen in order to maximize the utility of the executive (and perhaps that of the legislature if confirmation is required). However, several-often patronage-focused-processes within the appointments process focus instead on finding acceptable positions for ``necessary-to-place{''} individuals. Here, I develop a model where the goal is to find the best position for such an individual. In contrast to many existing models of the appointments process, I find that when the personnel process is focused on finding the best position for a given person as opposed to finding the best person for a given position, ``turkey farms{''}-agencies that have high numbers of minimally-competent (but necessary-to-place) individuals among their ranks-can result in equilibrium. Moreover, once agency capacity is sufficiently low, incompetent individual appointees no longer have detrimental effects on the utilities of the appointing principals, which further incentivizes the usage of certain agencies as ``turkey farms.{''}

N2  - How do politicians staff the bureaucracy and what are the policy implications? We develop a dynamic model of personnel policy, bureaucratic quality, and electoral competition. In each period, incumbents choose how much to support patronage and civil service personnel systems. The civil service system is needed to produce public goods, but patronage provides private goods and improves an incumbent’s reelection prospects. Incumbents must also worry about whether opponents will sustain the civil service system following an electoral loss. Our results demonstrate the importance of a cross-party commitment to public goods, along with low costs of civil service hiring, for encouraging good government in equilibrium. The model also suggests that electoral competitiveness has only a limited influence on good government and challenges previous arguments about electoral vulnerability and civil service reform. We finally present empirical evidence regarding our predicted relationship between party system convergence and merit-based hiring.

N2  - The political power of modern bureaucracies may be viewed as a democratic challenge. In fact, many reforms in the public sector aim to strengthen control over these bureaucracies, either by politicians or by citizens. This article argues that the need for control will depend on the degree of interest divergence between bureaucracy on the one hand, and politicians and citizens on the other. Still, attitudes in the three groups are seldom compared directly. Here, the attitudes towards different issues in the three groups are compared, within four small Norwegian municipalities. The results indicate that attitudes of local bureaucrats only to a limited degree diverge from those of politicians and the public, with one exception: attitudes towards so-called `New Public Management' reforms. Implications for control over bureaucracies are discussed.

N2  - This article addresses the general notion that bureaucrats may oppose the introduction of reforms in the public sector, and that their views concerning reform will differ from that of politicians. Such a situation may create a sense of conflict between the two spheres, but different views on public sector reform can also follow other conflict dimensions. Two such dimensions are outlined: the one between political parties, and the one between a political-administrative elite and a group of more peripheral politicians and administrators. The hypotheses set forward are tested by comparing local authority politicians' and administrative leaders' views on public sector reform. The data does not support the notion of general conflict between politicians and administrators, or that of conflict of interest between an elite and a more peripheral group. In general, politicians and administrators have rather similar views, but there is a wide difference between political parties. The administration places itself somewhat in the middle between political extremes, being moderately positive towards most reforms.

This article advances an alternative view that emphasizes their enabling effects. I argue that patron–client relations can be used to improve government performance by resolving principal–agent problems within political hierarchies. I substantiate this claim by examining how patronage networks shape economic performance of local governments in China. Using an original city–level panel data set between 2000 and 2011, and a new method that identifies patronage ties based on past promotions, I show that city leaders with informal ties to the incumbent provincial leaders deliver significantly faster economic growth than those without. I conduct additional analyses to rule out several important alternative explanations and provide evidence on the incentive-enhancing mechanism. These findings highlight the importance of informal institutions for bureaucratic management and authoritarian governance.

N2  - In carrying out public service duties, government duties, and the task of development, the State Civil Apparatus (ASN) employees must have professional capabilities as individuals as set out in ASN management based on the merit system. The absence of a clear career pattern arrangement will result in the low performance of government employees (PNS) and consequently have a low quality of public services, even resulting in service users having to pay a high cost economy. Career development through a good career pattern can encourage employees to grow and develop according to professionally owned competencies. Employees will be motivated to perform well which contributes to the improvement of agency performance. In addition to the above, there is a clear career pattern that also provides career security for structural and functional officials in the central and regional government. Career patterns are used as a guideline or reference in the appointment of someone to a certain position by referring to the position competency standards held, so that the process of transferring, promoting, transferring and demoting government employees (PNS) is better organized. Career patterns may no longer depend on the policies of the leadership of the institution. Clear career patterns in the area will also have a positive impact on the political climate in the region, where officials will be neutral when regional elections are held. Therefore policies need to be formulated regarding the career pattern of civil servants as a guide in the management of career patterns of civil servants that are selective, fair and competitive.

N2  - To understand polarization we must understand political parties. Polarization is often considered abnormal and even pathological. Yet this assumption is questionable. Polarization is typically defined as growing cohesion in the policy stands of parties' officials, activists, and voters and divergence in parties' policies (Fiorina and Abrams 2008). A comparative and historical perspective reveals that cohesive parties with divergent policy positions are common in stable democracies. Parties draw support from different societal interests, taking on divergent policy positions as a result (Karol 2009). Party competition also generates “teamsmanship” (Lee 2009), as politicians seek to discredit the other side while claiming credit for themselves. As a result, clear divisions between parties are the norm. In countries other than the United States, however, strong parties do not produce the dysfunction now visible in Washington. The problem is the mismatch between polarized parties and the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers. This tension was obscured for decades when parties were atypically divided and, earlier still, when the American state did little. The parties' increasing cohesion was unplanned, as was their mid-twentieth-century eclipse. Polarization may abate again, but there is little reason to believe such a development is imminent or that tinkering with redistricting, primaries, and campaign finance law will hasten it. Recognition of polarization's durability could eventually produce openness to reforms that are now beyond reach, such as a move toward a parliamentary system. In the medium term, however, abolishing the filibuster is a more realistic goal. AMERICAN PARTIES: PAST AND PRESENT Traditionally, political scientists have seen American parties as pragmatic and election oriented. For some leading party scholars, parties and interest groups were competing forms of political organization. E. E. Schattschneider saw the American political system plagued by “pressure groups” that he thought disproportionally represented the wealthy.

N2  - The bureaucracy has a profound impact on the direction of policy when it determines eligibility for a variety of government programs. Given the significance of eligibility determination for policy and the fact that street-level bureaucrats have great latitude when interpreting eligibility standards, organized interests have an incentive to try to influence the application of eligibility rules. Despite this, few researchers have explored the impact of organized interests on eligibility determination. Using data from the Veterans' Disability Compensation (VDC) program, we examine how organized interests affect the implementation of eligibility-based programs. We emphasize the dual role of many organized interests as both traditional advocacy groups and service providers and use insight from the interest group and third-party service provider literature to formulate hypotheses. We find that veterans' groups affect variables capturing demand for, access to, and effective implementation of the VDC program, although we do not find effects for every measure of implementation included in our study.

Although the period is outside the scope of the research, the author approaches the effects of the phenomenon today.
N2  - This article develops a two-part theory that accounts for both the origins and the persistence of patronage politics. First, greater centrifugal and disintegrative pressures at key moments in the state-building process give local elites more opportunity to institutionalize patronage at the subnational level. Second, decentralized patronage systems are more resistant to reform than centralized ones. Case studies of India and Ceylon illustrate how variation in centrifugal pressures allowed subnational elites to capture the state in the former but not the latter. Further data from the British Empire shows that greater centrifugal pressures faced by British colonies at the time of decolonization are correlated with the persistence of higher levels of patronage over time.

N2  - Scholarship on separation of powers assumes executives are constrained by legislative approval when placing agents in top policy-making positions. But presidents frequently fill vacancies in agency leadership with unconfirmed, temporary officials or leave them empty entirely. I develop a novel dataset of vacancies across 15 executive departments from 1977 to 2016 and reevaluate the conventional perspective that appointment power operates only through formal channels. I argue that presidents' nomination strategies include leaving positions empty and making interim appointments, and this choice reflects presidents' priorities and the character of vacant positions. The evidence indicates that interim appointees are more likely when positions have a substantial capacity to act on presidential expansion priorities and suggest that presidents can capitalize on their first-mover advantage to evade Senate confirmation. The results further suggest that separation of powers models may need to consider how deliberate inaction and sidestepping of formal powers influence political control and policy-making strategies.

N2  - The strategic nature of presidential appointments and politicization of federal prosecution have flourished as separate strains of research. This article opens a dialogue between them by theoretically developing expectations for the three distinct origins of interim U.S. Attorneys. The expectations are tested using an original, continuous data set of all 93 U.S. Attorney positions for 1987 to 2016, which, unlike any other study, includes details of appointment and service for Senate-confirmed and interim appointees. We find that the opportunity to realize his agenda and divergence from his predecessors motivates the president's revealed preference for interim United States Attorneys of his own choosing.

N2  - Objective Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign was unorthodox by any standard. But does an unorthodox campaign result in an administration different from its predecessors? Methods We examine the Trump transition to identify similarities with and differences from previous administrations. Results Similarities include certain patterns in personnel selections, centralization of policy making, and the role of the vice president. Key differences include fewer high-ranking officials with prior experience in government, the White House chief of staff lacking policy experience, a higher proportion of nominations being challenged in the Senate, and decrease in gender and ethnic diversity among key appointees. Conclusion An unorthodox presidential campaign produced an administration somewhat different but not wholly different from its predecessors.

L1  - file:///Users/nayaramcd/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Kopecký, Meyer-Sahling, Spirova - 2022 - Extreme political polarization and party patronage(2).pdf
N2  - The contemporary literature on political parties has identified their gradual but consistent shift away from civil society and towards the state. As parties are becoming ever increasingly dependent on state resources and exclusively interested in governing, as Mair (Ruling the void: The hollowing of western democracy {[}Verso Books, 2013]) suggested, and patronage is a fundamental to that relationship, the degree and modes of party patronage becomes pivotal to understanding their performance, and the ways they organize and govern. In this paper we argue that party patronage is likely to be structured by the nature of political competition and explore the effects of political polarization, which is a feature of political competition relatively independent from the precise format of a party system, on patronage practices. We advance a theoretical argument which systematically links different types of political polarization with different patterns of party patronage, arguing that extreme polarization incentivizes political parties to develop heavily partisan strategies of party patronage which, in turn, further fuel political polarization. Thus, we also contribute to burgeoning literature on political polarization and its negative effects on the functioning of both political parties and overall political systems.

N2  - Presidents become increasingly effective at managing the bureaucracy because of the information and expertise that they acquire from on-the-job experience. In their appointment choices, this theory predicts that presidents become better at reducing information asymmetries incurred from the bureaucracy (Agent Selection Learning), improve the vertical balance of leadership agent traits between top supervisory positions and subordinates directly beneath them (Agent Monitoring Learning), and place a greater relative premium on loyalty in response to horizontal policy conflict between the White House and the Senate (Common Agency Learning). This logic obtains empirical support from the analysis of bureaucratic agent traits for Senate-confirmed presidential appointees serving in leadership positions covering 39 U.S. federal government agencies from 1977 to 2009. Presidents’ appointment strategies reflect their increasing effectiveness at managing the bureaucracy, thus complementing their increasing reliance on administrative mechanisms to achieve policy objectives as their tenure in office rises.

N2  - This Article considers the constitutional status of mandatory partisan balance requirements for presidential appointments to independent federal agencies. Since the 1880s, Congress routinely has included partisan balance requirements, along with fixed terms of office and ``good cause{''} limitations on the President's removal power, as standard design elements in its template for independent federal agencies. Until recently, both federal courts and most legal scholars have assumed the constitutionality of such restrictions on the President's appointment power and with good reason, given the ubiquity of partisan balance requirements and the executive branch's historical acquiescence to them. However, the Supreme Court's decision in Free Enterprise Fund threatens to upend this well-settled consensus; the decision squarely holds that Congress may not unduly attenuate the President's power to supervise and control executive branch entities including independent agencies without violating the separation of powers doctrine. In this Article, we posit that partisan balance requirements, at least when used in conjunction with fixed terms of office and good cause removal limitations, create a problem of at least equal magnitude to the problem identified in Free Enterprise Fund (namely, unduly insulating executive officers with policymaking authority via a two-tiered good cause removal limitation). Under the logic of Free Enterprise Fund, requiring the President to appoint political opponents to principal offices within the executive branch, and then prohibiting the President from removing such appointees except for good cause, unduly compromises the President's ability to supervise and control these agencies. Although Humphrey's Executor settled the constitutional status of good cause limits on the President's removal power for principal officers serving on independent federal agencies, Free Enterprise Fund `s broadly formalist reading of the Vesting and Faithful Execution Clauses strongly suggests that the combination of a partisan balance requirement with a good cause removal limit constitutes a bridge too far in the age of new formalism.

N1  - Although the author focuses on a Canadian province, he explores the effects of the domestic policy.
N2  - International and domestic developments have a direct impact on forest policy in British Columbia. At the domestic level, the BC government maintains significant control over softwood lumber as a result of provincial land ownership, executive dominance, and the role of the Ministry of Forests. This is reinforced by a close relationship between the bureaucracy and key industry associations. Under the New Democratic Party government of the 1990s, however, the policy relevance of environment, labour, and aboriginal groups increased. The election of the BC Liberals, however, diminished these interests, with the possible exception of First Nations groups. It is also important, however, to acknowledge the significance of international developments. Institutionally, these pressures contributed to bureaucratic restructuring and a changing ``culture'' within the Ministry of Forests. Industry relations have also been influenced by consolidation of ownership, bilateral lumber disputes with the United States, and the increasing role of non-elected legal representatives. In addition, environment and labour interests were empowered by external funding, high export demands, and a low Canadian dollar. Although these developments have created an increasingly complex policy process, it is apparent that domestic considerations remain dominant, especially traditional participants, such as the Ministry of Forests and other specific setoral interests.

N2  - Implementation of Merit Based Personnel Policies (MBPP) continues to be a highly problematic endeavour in Latin American countries. According to the literature, this is usually caused by the politico-administrative inheritances that characterize this region, such as patronage, corruption, centralism and the lack of effective accountability mechanisms. By looking at Mexico's recent Civil Service reform process, this article shows that the development of new MBPP has been certainly constrained by some of those factors. However, the article also shows that a number of issues faced during the Mexican reform process can be linked to ``simpler{''} issues of policy design and implementation. The article thus concludes that while ``patronage{''}, ``amiguismo{''}, illegality, and other traditional features of Latin American (and Mexican) administrative systems remain a central impediment for developing well-functioning MBPP, academics and practitioners should probably pay more attention to policy design issues (e. g. policy co-ordination; time and resources availability; institutional framework design), which contribute to better explaining and understanding why MBPP implementation remains such a challenging task in this region.

N2  - Parallel streams of literature in economics and management suggest that a centralized power structure tends to produce a top-heavy personnel structure in government bureaucracies. Supportive evidence is derived from a hand-collected dataset of ministry organization charts from 22 European countries. The structure of the bureaucratic pyramid is more top heavy in Eastern Europe than it is in Western Europe. Within Eastern Europe, countries that have preserved Soviet-style bureaucratic power structures have the most top-heavy ministries, whereas others that have reduced power centralization by separating political and administrative power have less top-heavy ministry pyramids that are more like those found in Western Europe.

N2  - This article explores the role of bureaucratic representation and distributional equity in the implementation of environmental policy, which has been shaped by the politics of identity, administrative discretion, and a contested discourse on the redistribution of public resources. The authors examine whether minority bureaucratic representation fosters policy outputs for race-related disadvantaged communities and whether the behavior of public administrators reflects distributional equity. Linking representative bureaucracy to environmental justice, this research contributes to the understanding of social equity in public administration and sheds light on the relationship between bureaucratic representation and democratic values. Analyzing a nationwide, block-group-level data set, the authors find that a more racially representative workforce in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promotes the agency's enforcement actions in communities that have large local-national disparities in minority populations and severe policy problems. The size of the bureaucratic representation effect is larger for neighborhoods that are overburdened with race-related social vulnerability. Evidence for Practice Public administrators can play a critical role in representing the general public, particularly those who have historically been marginalized and underserved, and acting in their interests. Non-service-oriented regulatory agencies have taken equity into account in the process of implementing policies and serving socially vulnerable clients. Public administrators need to be cognizant of the degree of preexisting inequity in local communities, acquire adequate information to ascertain the equity point, and devise public policies and programs to achieve various democratic values. It is important to recruit more underrepresented and historically disadvantaged members of society into the public workforce.

N2  - This paper examines Mexico City’s meat supply system from the 1850s to 1967. During this period, whereas some urban centers in the Americas replaced traditional provisioning methods – abattoir system – with meatpacking companies, Mexico City continued to rely on the municipal monopoly to provide meat for the masses. This study focuses on the role that ranchers, cattle purveyors (introductores), and slaughterhouse (rastro) workers, alongside city officials, played in this process. It shows how these actors evolved accommodating to any authority in power, regardless of ideology. As interest groups, introductores, workers, and ranchers not only delivered a service to city dwellers but with varying degrees of influence, they also provided essential political support to governments. For their part, city officials protected these associations as a means of managing supplies and in the name of public order. Such a mutually beneficial relationship allowed both (interest groups and the municipality) to resist meatpacking conglomerates well into the twentieth century. The work underscores that although at occasions these arrangements facilitated meat provision, in others, they hindered the extension of animal proteins to the working poor – one of the main goals of post-revolutionary Mexico. © 2020 Centro de Estudios Historico-Rurales.

N2  - One of the most important demonstrations of power in Washington is the ability to recruit sitting government officials to become active proponents of one's position. Many have suggested money is the key: Campaign contributions buy friends, access, and perhaps even policy activism. We provide an alternative view based on a deceptively simple observation: Lobbyists rarely lobby alone. We show empirically that government policymakers respond to the overall structure of conflict, not the resources of individual lobbying groups. Our project is based on in-depth interviews with over 300 policy advocates and systematic information on each of more than 2,000 advocates playing a significant role in a random sample of 98 policy issues in the United States federal government from 1999 to 2002.

N2  - This article explores the origins of peak employers' associations to understand why countries produce highly centralized macrocorporatist groups, weaker national associations but stronger industry-level groups, or highly fragmented pluralist associations. The authors suggest that the structure of partisan competition played a vital causal role in the development and evolution of these peak associations. The leadership for peak employers' association development came from business-oriented party activists and bureaucrats, who sought both to advance industrial development policy and to solve specific problems of political control. Business-oriented party leaders and bureaucrats in both predemocratic and democratic regimes feared the rising tide of democracy and labor activism and viewed employer organization as a useful tool for political control, to secure parliamentary advantage, and to serve as a societal counterweight to working-class activism. Because leadership for association building came from the state, the political rules of the game were crucial to outcomes. The structure of party competition and state centralization shaped incentives for strategic coordination for both political actors and employers. Dedicated business parties were more likely to develop in countries with multiparty systems and limited federal power sharing than in countries with two-party systems and federalism: in a multiparty context where no single party was likely to gain power, each party had an incentive to cooperate with other social groups. Moreover, business-oriented party leaders and bureaucrats in multiparty systems were motivated to delegate policy-making authority to coordinated societal channels for industrial relations, because they anticipated that employers would win more in these channels than in parliamentary settings where the center and left could form a coalition against the right. Again, centralized party systems were more likely than federal ones to develop a dedicated national business party that transcended regional cleavages and to retain a strong role for the state in the governance of industrial relations.

N2  - This chapter discusses the development and nature of the European Union (EU) lobbying system. Pallis has documented the mobilization of maritime transport groups since the mid-1970s. He noted that the EU has been trying to develop a Common Maritime Transport Policy, the scope and depth of the policies has shifted from minimalist to an approach that considers comprehensive EU policies. As a result of this power shift to the EU level a variety of stakeholders has identified a new level of power, and has formed EU-level interest groups seeking to ‘shoot where the ducks are’. The chapter discusses bureaucracy and the particular behavioural traits that modern bureaucracies exhibit. Anthony Downs formulated many hypotheses concerning bureaucratic behaviour. This chapter concludes by suggesting that lobbying in the EU is likely to remain pluralistic, unpredictable and favouring those actors who can mobilize ideas and knowledge in order to influence the framing of public policies.

N2  - Purpose - Firms influence a government to their advantage in one of two ways: either through lobbying a government to change the rule, or through bribing bureaucrats to circumvent the rule. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether and under what conditions do corporate political activities facilitate firm growth in a multinational context, especially in developing economies. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on the data of the World Bank's Enterprise Survey, conducted by the World Bank in the 2002 to 2006 period in 12 countries. To deal with a multilevel structure, the authors applied multilevel regression as the main analysis method. Findings - The analysis reveals that both political activities are prevalent in emerging markets, but they play very different roles on firm growth. The authors also find that the effect of lobbying is more pronounced in politically durable countries where firms can secure their vested benefits by lobbying. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the corporate political activities literature by investigating the distinguishing and contingent role of bribery and lobbying on firm performance.

N2  - This paper examines how bureaucracy affects political accountability and electoral selection, using a three-tier political agency model consisting of voters, politicians and bureaucrats. In the model's hierarchy, politicians are constrained by elections while bureaucrats are controlled by budgets. If voters and bureaucrats prefer different types of politicians (i.e. they have a conflict of interests), incumbents pass oversized budgets to prevent bureaucrats from engaging in strategic behaviours that damage incumbents’ reputations. If, instead, voters and bureaucrats prefer the same type of politicians (i.e. they have an alignment of interests), bureaucrats cannot obtain a concession from politicians. In the latter case, however, bureaucrats send voters a credible signal regarding an incumbent's type, which improves electoral selection. This paper also shows that political appointment systems improve political accountability in the conflict-of-interests case while they weaken electoral selection in the alignment-of-interests case.

N2  - This study explores the revolving door phenomenon–when public office holders move back and forth from the public to the private sector, often becoming lobbyists–and its implications on regulatory capture. It draws on the literature on regulatory capture theory and 46 interviews conducted in Quebec with public officers (ministers, chiefs of staff, deputy ministers, and heads of governmental organizations) whose career path includes a revolving door scenario, as well as observers of the phenomenon. New light is shed on capture theory by using a broad definition of the revolving door that focuses on the entry stage. A key finding is that “cultural capture” can occur when new public officers come from the same private sector now within their purview. Based on public officers’ allegiance to their former industry, lobbying is de facto exerted, “from within.” Despite clear irregularities and conflicts of interest, most of those interviewed do not believe in tightening rules and prefer continuing with vigilance from public office holders, journalists, and other observers.

This research is quantitative, Data analysis techniques are multiple linear regression. Data collection techniques using questionnaires and interviews. The Respondents are 109 people of 305 people on structural officials in the scope of the Gowa Regency Government and the Makassar City government by using proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The research findings are the politics (X1) has a stronger influence than the competency (X2) in the promotion of local government bureaucracy, with the regression equation Y = 0.518 + 0.511 (X1)+0.420 (X2)+e, the influence of political aspects in promotion is dominated by the element of power expansion and job distribution because both are the basis for strengthening the dominance of the leader. Regarding aspects of competence, elements of knowledge and skills are very dominant influences in the promotion of the Office, both of which become indicators of employee reliability and professionalism. The strong influence of the political aspect compared aspect of the influence of competency in promotions Office, because the interests of political officials for trying to maintain power and career officials trying to maintain position. The promotion system combines merit system and patronage system, which is expected to get officials who have high competence and high integrity, without ignoring demands to accommodate supporters during the election of political official in the regional government.

N2  - This paper considers current contradictions in state-business relations in Russia. On one hand, the Russian political elite needs economic growth to keep social stability in the country and to limit mass protesting in big cities. Economic growth is impossible without investment, which explains Russian leaders' increased interest in improving Russia's business climate. On the other hand, influential interest groups (represented first of all by security and law enforcement agencies) try to expand their control on rent sources in the economy. These groups of interests could strengthen their positions due to fear of political protests. This strong conflict among different groups in the Russian elite creates additional uncertainty for investors and the business community, and can lead to economic recession independent of the level of oil prices and dynamics of global markets. Reversing these negative trends in economic development will be possible only with collective actions of different economic and political actors (including technocrats in federal and regional governments, representatives of large and successful middle-sized business and top-managers of public sector organizations) in the search for pragmatic solutions to the challenges faced by Russian economy and society.

N2  - The US federal bureaucracy implements the nation's laws while juggling its own preferences and the preferences of numerous stakeholders. This article begins to unpack the conditions under which the bureaucracy responds to its stakeholders during rule making, and it is argued that bureaucratic responsiveness is conditioned on the level of attention provided by Congress and the President. This argument is tested with a dataset of forty rules and 1,444 interest group comments. Interest group influence is found to be constrained by congressional - but not presidential - attention to rule making. The results also shed light on Wilson's interest group theory of politics and suggest that the fragmentation of group preferences is less important than the central message sent by groups.

N2  - Students of politics have identified a variety of actors who appear to influence the federal bureaucracy's implementation of public policy, including Congress, the president, and interest groups. These lines of research, however, have often portrayed interest groups as actors with indirect influence (who, for example, work through or with Congress), rather than assessing the direct influence of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs. I conduct a test of direct interest group influence by analyzing an original data set composed of 1,444 interest group comments in reaction to forty federal agency rules. I find, contrary to the expectations of the extant literature, that the formal participation of interest groups during rulemaking can, and often does, alter the content of policy within the "fourth branch" of government. I conclude that those who voice their preferences during the notice and comment period rulemaking are often able to change government policy outputs to better match their preferences.

N2  - We test the proposition that the federal bureaucracy exhibits a ``bias toward business'' during notice and comment rulemaking. We analyze over 30 bureaucratic rules and almost 1,700 comments over the period of 1994 to 2001. We find that business commenters, but not nonbusiness commenters, hold important influence over the content of final rules. We also demonstrate that as the proportion of business commenters increases, so too does the influence of business interests. These findings contrast with previous empirical studies and generally suggest that notice and comment procedures have not succeeded in ``democratizing'' the agency policymaking process to the extent sometimes suggested in the normative rulemaking literature.

N1  - cited By 2
N2  - Recent studies of representation at the national and state levels have provided evidence that elected officials’ votes, political parties’ platforms, and enacted policy choices are more responsive to the preferences of the affluent, while those with average incomes and the poor have little or no impact on the political process. Yet, this research on the dominance of the affluent has overlooked key partisan differences in the electorate. In this era of hyperpartisanship, we argue that representation occurs through the party system, and we test whether taking this reality into account changes the story of policy dominance by the rich. We combine data on public preferences and state party positions to test for income bias in parties’ representation of their own co-partisans. The results show an interesting pattern in which underrepresentation of the poor is driven by Democratic parties pushing the more liberal social policy stances of rich Democrats and Republican parties reflecting the particularly conservative economic policy preferences of rich Republicans. Thus, we have ample evidence that the wealthy, more often than not, do call the shots, but that the degree to which this disproportionate party responsiveness produces less representative policies depends on the party in power and the policy dimension being considered. We conclude by linking this pattern of influence and “coincidental representation” to familiar changes which define the transformation of the New Deal party system.

N2  - In this article we evaluate the relationship between political control and bureaucratic performance using information requested by researchers via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and Congress via congressional committee requests. The information requested was the same, and the timing of requests was similar. We find modest evidence of a relationship between agency politicization and a lack of responsiveness to requests for information from the public and Congress. Politicized agencies are slower to respond to requests even when controlling for agency size and workload. There is little evidence, however, that these agencies are more likely to respond poorly when they do respond. The difficulties in responding appear to be due to poor performance of the FOIA offices, either because political actors focus more on other agency activities or because of poorer management agency-wide. We conclude that efforts to make agencies responsive to elected officials may hurt management performance.

N2  - Representative bureaucracy is a values-based theory of bureaucratic decision making. Its key assumption is that a bureaucrat's demography shapes her pre-organizational socialization, values, and ultimately her decisions, in a way that can advance the interests of a represented client or group (i.e., active representation). However, scholars have not critically examined the presumed links among these four factors. We review the literature and make an argument for representative bureaucracy scholars to incorporate a psychological perspective to better understand the behavioral mechanisms that influence active representation. We discuss the tripartite classification of the mind, dual-process theories of decision making, identity theory and the deservingness heuristic as theoretical perspectives scholars can use to investigate the behavioral foundations of representative bureaucracy.

N2  - While the Nordic countries have a tradition of integrating privileged interest groups into policy making, a number of studies have argued that this Nordic `routine corporatism' has changed over the last decades. Studies of Denmark, Norway and Sweden demonstrate that interest groups are less frequently involved in committees preparing policy, that lobbying of parliament has become more important and that the position of citizen groups has strengthened. However, systematic studies of present-day Finland are largely missing. This article therefore adds to the literature by focusing on the Finnish case. Drawing on surveys of interest groups and civil servants, the involvement of interest groups in policy making in Finland is assessed and compared with Denmark and the United Kingdom. It is found that: (1) working groups and similar bodies are still very important sites of advocacy; (2) public administration is a more important site of advocacy than parliament or government; (3) economic groups continue to enjoy a particularly privileged position; and (4) resources predict groups' access to policy making more strongly in Finland than in Denmark or the United Kingdom. These findings imply that routine corporatism persists in Finland to a greater extent than in Denmark. The study augments the existing evidence that corporatism may have adapted to new circumstances rather than being eliminated.

N2  - This paper studies the policy impact of civil service regulations, exploiting reforms undertaken by US state governments throughout the twentieth century. These reforms replaced political patronage with a civil service recruited based on merit and protected from politics. I find that state politicians respond to these changes by spending relatively less through the reformed state-level bureaucracies. Instead, they allocate more funds to lower level governments. The reallocation of expenditures leads to reduced long-term investment by state governments.

N2  - The role of interested groups within English tourism policy development has increased considerably in recent years. There are several possible explanations for this, including changing government policy styles, the perception of the importance of tourism to the national economy, and the developing sophistication of a tourism policy network. This paper reviews the role of interested groups and the nature of tourism policy development in England within the context of a theoretical discussion on public policy analysis, policy styles and policy networks. It specifically reports on the relationship between the tourism interest groups and government, and the mechanisms used by them to influence policy development. The paper shows that the tourism policy network can be characterised as immature. It has government at its centre directing strategic policy, with two sub-networks concentrating on the detail of commercial tourism and tourism resource policy. Within these sub-networks are dominant and secondary players defined as such by the manner in which they use their resources, gain access to decision-makers, collaborate with like-minded groups and work with government bureaucracy.

N2  - This article probes the extent to which the new literature on civil society should lead to a revised understanding of Japan's political economy and policymaking processes. We seek to place two literatures - the older work on political economy and the more recent writings on civil society - in perspective. The article presents a broad analysis of the influence of civil society groups, drawing evidence from the JIGS survey of interest groups, an extensive random sample survey of more than 1,600 associations in Tokyo and also in Ibaraki Prefecture, involving 36 questions and 260 subquestions. The analysis provides a general overview of the involvement of civil society groups in the policymaking process. We focus on three main aspects. First, we distinguish among the types of groups that involve themselves in policy making. These groups are broken down in the JIGS survey by their predominant activity (e.g., agricultural groups or sports groups) and their legal status. Second, we investigate in which areas groups seek to influence policy. This means both the broad issue area (e.g., agriculture) as well as the groups' response to a specific list of policy changes over the past decade. Third, we probe the relationships these groups have with other groups as well as with other political actors (e.g., local governments, political parties). Also, we are concerned with the means by which the groups seek to influence policy making - and we include in this category specific information such as whether the groups offered electoral support or provided postretirement posts to bureaucrats. We find that Japanese associational structure is characterized by the pronounced strength of economic or business organizations compared to other groups. This is true when we look at the number of groups, the size or resources of the organizations and the success that economic groups have in gaining access to policy makers. Our evidence reinforces the picture of high levels of communication and interaction between business organizations and the economic bureaucracy, and the relative exclusion of citizens' groups.

N2  - Most government bureaucracies in developed countries use civil service systems. What accounts for their adoption? We develop and test a model of bureaucratic reforms under repeated partisan competition. In the model, two political parties composed of overlapping generations of candidates compete for office. Under a spoils system, an incumbent politician can either continue to "politicize" the bureaucracy, which allows her to direct benefits to voters in a way that will increase her electoral prospects, or she can "insulate" the bureaucracy, which prevents all future winners from using the bureaucracy for electoral advantage. Our main result is that politicization persists when incumbents expect to win, and insulation takes place when they expect to lose. We test this hypothesis using data from the adoption of civil service reforms across the U.S. states. The predictions of the model are consistent with the empirical patterns leading up to the implementation of the general civil service reforms. Using both state and city level data, we observe an increase in partisan competition prior to the reforms.

N2  - This article develops a theory of bureaucratic influence on distributive politics. Although there exists a rich literature on the effects of institutions such as presidents, electoral systems, and bicameralism on government spending, the role of professional bureaucrats has yet to receive formal scrutiny. In the model, legislators bargain over the allocation of distributive benefits across districts. The legislature may either "politicize" a program by bargaining directly over pork and bypassing bureaucratic scrutiny, or "professionalize" it by letting a bureaucrat approve or reject project funding in each district according to an underlying quality standard. The model predicts that the legislature will professionalize when the expected program quality is high. However, politicization becomes more likely as the number of high-quality projects increases and under divided government. Further, more competent bureaucrats can encourage politicization if the expected program quality is low. Finally, politicized programs are larger than professionalized programs.

N2  - This paper analyzes and criticizes changes in the relationship between politics and the bureaucracy, in Japan up to the present from the viewpoint of administrative organizations and related public law system. Drastic changes in the legal system, or legal reform, may sometimes undermine the true intention of the policy and its implementation. Thus, bringing political leadership in administrative decision-making bodies cannot be easily concluded as better or worse than the complete separation of administration and government. To analyze this matter in detail, this paper looks at the following points: 1) Analysis of the operation of the limited political appointment system under the one-party dominance by the Liberal Democratic Party and several attempts of administrative reform; 2) Changes in the government in 1993 that broke the Liberal Democratic Party's rule and subsequent changes in executive personnel and political leadership by the prime minister's office; and 3) The establishment of the Cabinet Bureau of Personnel Affairs in May 2014, which strengthened the involvement of the Cabinet in the executive staff personnel. Through an analysis of these changes, the institutional basis of the current phenomenon of increasing enforcement power and expanding administrative power is presented. Then this article considers current problems of democratic legitimacy within institutional limitations and policymaking, coordination of political leadership and securing administrative expertise. As a conclusion, this paper considers the requirement of separation of power in Japan and possible solutions to the increasing influence of political leadership on administrative power.

N2  - Data manipulation is considered one of the most pernicious forms of information distortion that challenges the effectiveness of the principals in monitoring agents. This study investigates factors influencing the behaviors of data manipulation from the perspective of patronage networks. Patronage networks feature a reciprocal exchange between patrons who control appealing resources and clients who ask for protection and benefits from the patrons. We hypothesize that in a three-tier principal-supervisor-agent model, agents favored in the patronage network would receive tacit permission and protection from the supervisor, and hence be encouraged to falsify performance data and game the principal. The empirical results, using panel regression models based on officially reported and satellite-observed environmental emissions data in China, suggest that cities with leaders favored in the patronage network present a stronger tendency for data manipulation. This study has theoretical implications for understanding the impact of informal institutions on performance management.

N2  - Although many institutional obstacles for civic participation have remained in Taiwan, a decade of democratization has created more opportunities for environmental activists to influence policymaking. The policymaking processes for environmental impact assessment and air pollution prevention fees illustrate how environmental groups can potentially exert considerable influence on the bureaucracy by gaining support from legislators, the media, and occasionally the courts. More civic participation may slow down environmental policymaking, but it helps to ensure a strong government commitment to protecting broad-based environmental interests.

N2  - Taiwan has been moving toward democracy, with a dramatic transition taking place in the past decade. Critical to this transition is a restructuring of the relationship between the state bureaucracy and society. This study focuses on democratization's effect on Taiwan's bureaucracy. In particular, it seeks to examine such aspects of bureaucratic transformation as bureaucratic decisionmaking, legislative-bureaucratic politics, interest group-bureaucratic relations, the expansion of local autonomy, and civil service reform. This study finds that the bureaucratic state is facing a great challenge from political, legislative, and societal forces. The old type of insulated bureaucratic planning and decision making is no longer possible, the bureaucracy is losing its KMT patrons, and bureaucrats are finding themselves answerable to political pressure, legislative oversight, and interest group lobbying. While the bureaucracy has lost its previous level of discretion in terms of macro-management and the formulation of developmental policies, the bureaucratic state has not withered away.

N2  - Recruitment to the civil service is, in order to prevent patronage, often centralized and based on performance in competitive examinations. This approach, albeit slow and occasionally cumbersome, is generally assumed to be the most meritocratic method of recruitment. However, while some applicants may have skills suited for a specific position, they may not perform best in a general examination. As long as the system is not abused, a more flexible recruitment process based on, for example, interviews and CV screening, may be more meritocratic. It is therefore necessary to weigh the risk of abuse against the potential gains from more flexibility. Formal civil service examinations are hypothesized in this article to be the most meritocratic way to recruit civil servants only in countries where the risk for patronage is high. Analysis of a dataset describing the structures and characteristics of bureaucracies worldwide lends support to the hypothesis.

N2  - In recent years literature on public administration in Australia has often referred to the increasing politicisation of both the federal and state public services. Increasingly, senior members of the bureaucracy are appointed on contract. Such contracts can often be terminated without the need to give reasons. Presumably some dismissals will be motivated by partisan, or party-political, considerations. Where this is so, what role might there be for anti-discrimination legislation, particularly that denying discrimination on the grounds of political belief or activity in the workplace?

N2  - Recent studies of the theory of representative bureaucracy have focused on active representation, whereby administrators in public organizations work to advance the interests of particular groups, achieving policy outcomes that directly address the needs of those groups. The concept of administrative discretion is central to these studies, as an administrator must have the discretion to produce results that reflect the values and beliefs of these groups. While the presence of discretion is often implied in these studies, few have examined it explicitly. Using data from the Former's Home Administration, we explore whether administrators who perceive themselves as having more discretion enact policy outcomes that are more representative of minority interests. The results strongly support the conclusion that administrators who perceive themselves as possessing significant discretion and who assume the role of minority representative in their agencies are more likely to enact policy outcomes that favor minority interests.

N2  - The public bureaucracies of Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain may be set apart from the rest of West European bureaucracies. Until the mid-1990s, the former were distinguished from the latter by certain interrelated structural characteristics. These characteristics were extended politicisation of the top administrative ranks; enduring patronage patterns in recruitment to the public sector; uneven distribution of human resources; formalism and legalism; and, with the exception of Spain, absence of a typical European administrative elite. The characteristics were related to the type of capitalism and political development in Southern Europe. South European bureaucracies have started evolving towards decentralisation and privatisation. However, convergence with the bureaucracies of other EU member-states is an open question.

N2  - A system of adequately performing public bureaucracies is a basic requirement for developing countries to progress and prosper. However, public management in developing countries is often threatened by politicization and ineffective human resource management policies. In this article, we analyse public management in Eritrea, one of the world's poorest countries that gained independence in the early 1990s. In this analysis, we use general (western) theoretical frames of reference, including pre-modern, weberian and new public management lines of thinking. It will show that, in current Eritrea, all known styles of public management concur and collide and that this situation is related to the cultural, educational and political background of the various population groups that strive for job opportunities in the public sector's strategic apex. This collision of styles may lead to frustration and ineffectiveness among the people involved. Only a managerial policy stressing practical wisdom and intelligence may satisfy all the groups of people engaged in Eritrea's public management, in fact in all developing countries' public organizations.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to develop and test a model of political influence on regulation that incorporates both the competing interests of elected officials and the relevant institutional constraints. To do this, we focus on one channel of political influence: the appointment of agency leaders to a multimember regulatory board. The model has two stages: first, a bargaining stage between the president and Senate in which they choose a target policy; and second, the appointments stage in which they attempt to implement this target by choosing the median board member. The model's empirical leverage arises because elected officials can replace board members only when seats on the board become available through term expiration or resignation. This yields specific predictions about how and whether each appointment will change policy. We apply the model to the NLRB. The empirical results, investigating all appointments to the NLRB from 1949 until 1988, fit our theory remarkably well.

N2  - In a signalling model of lobbying the politicians' decision whether to delegate policy authority and an interest group's choice between lobbying politicians or bureaucrats are investigated. Only bureaucrats are able to assess policy-relevant information coming from the interest group, but their interests may differ from those of politicians. In equilibrium politicians weigh the benefits of an informed policy decision against bureaucratic drift. We obtain that delegation occurs only when the bureaucracy is not too much biased and when the stakes of the interest group are not too high. Still, politicians sometimes prefer a biased bureaucracy and the interest group to have a larger stake. The model also predicts that interest groups typically lobby politicians to further delegation.

N2  - Much of the literature on clientelism views the distribution of state jobs in the same way it does other forms of clientelistic exchange: as a mechanism of political mobilization. Despite its prevalence, this perspective does not account for the services that job recipients frequently provide to their political principals beyond the one-time exchange of political support. Drawing on extensive data from Benin and Ghana, including a comprehensive database of minister biographies, surveys of bureaucrats, administrative data, and elite interviews, this article argues that leaders distribute and manage state jobs in ways that enable them to extract and control state money for political financing. Whether incumbent leaders extract state resources themselves, delegate to elite party agents, or co-opt and coerce bureaucrats to divert money to the party shapes which jobs they distribute politically and to whom. The findings suggest that jobs are substantively different from other currencies of clientelistic exchange. © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Bureaucracies may set priorities for their workload in response to social goals or pressures from concentrated private interests. This paper explores bureaucratic priorities empirically by studying Superfund, the federal program for cleaning up contaminated sites, It examines the amount of time that sites on Superfund's National Priorities List require to complete three stages from listing to cleanup, using an econometric method for multiple sequential durations. The empirical results provide little evidence that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prioritizes sites according to their harms. By contrast, concentrated private interests, such as liable parties and local communities, play an important role in the EPA's priorities. Delays caused by liable parties may reduce net benefits of cleanup by 8 percent. This result suggests a benefit from funding provision of environmental quality and other public goods through diffuse sources, such as broad-based taxes, to avoid the detrimental effects of such concentrated interests.

N2  - Many scholars have offered explanations as to why women are underrepresented at all levels of government. Conventional wisdom states that fewer women are in public office due to lower ambition, and that the presence of gendered perceptions among women considering elected office contributes to women’s disinterest in the political arena. Using original survey data, this article expands the theory of gendered perceptions to current state-level appointed officeholders to explain their levels of interest in pursuing higher public office. The results indicate that gendered perceptions affect the progressive ambitions of appointees; like studies of ambition in elected officials, this study of appointed officials finds that women are generally less ambitious, and unlike studies of ambition in elected officials, this study of appointed officials finds that women with higher self-assessments are less ambitious rather than more.

Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that regional governments employ a variety of tools and strategies to compete over federal transfers. This study uses data on federal transfers during 2002–2012 to examine the factors associated with the politically sensitive share of such transfers occurring in this period. The key findings highlight the importance of administrative capacity and the value of attracting attention from, as well as cultivating relations with, federal officials for shaping decision-making on the distribution of federal transfers. We discuss some specific strategies used by more successful regional governments in attracting additional federal funds.

N2  - This study is an attempt to relate the effectiveness of the rule-making process to political controls on the bureaucracies that create regulations. Such controls include requiring cost-benefit analysis, requiring review of regulations by a legislative committee, and requiring interest group participation in rule writing efforts. Scholars have both credited controls with allowing politicians to control future bureaucratic decision making and blamed controls for ossifying the regulatory process. This article considers eight case studies of state regulation of child care. These case studies cast doubt on the assertions that political controls play a prominent role in bureaucratic decision making. The rule-making decisions of bureaucrats in these case studies were influenced far more by executives and legislators in power and interest groups than by the presence or absence of procedural controls put in place by previous political officeholders.

N2  - The modern presidency is one of administration, where presidents seek to further their own agendas by directing administrative behavior throughout the executive branch. Yet little research explores how executive agencies organize their policy processes in response to publicly articulated presidential priorities. Using two novel datasets that allow us to examine the regulatory priorities of presidents and how executive agencies organize their rulemaking processes, we find that executive agencies respond to presidential policy preferences by centralizing policymaking to the top of an agency's hierarchy, placing regulation in the hands of political appointees.

N2  - Introducing merit recruitment of public servants is a central good governance reform. To move towards merit in practice, legislation which mandates merit recruitment is considered a necessary but insufficient first step by many scholars and practitioners. Merit-based civil service legislation should thus be sought before reform in practice. This article challenges this reasoning. It argues that merit laws are neither sufficient nor necessary: they leave the incumbent's possibility frontier for patronage and meritocracy in practice unaffected. Large- and small-n evidence supports this assertion. Analyses of an original dataset of coded civil service legislation in 117 countries from 1975 to 2015 suggest that countries can attain meritocratic recruitment with and without legal merit requirements. Subsequently, a comparison of Paraguay and the Dominican Republic provides micro-evidence for the underlying mechanism. Conventional wisdom about the sequencing of governance reforms in developing countries may thus be misleading: legal reform need not come first.

N1  - cited By 11
N2  - Public employment in most developing countries is governed by political patronage. Patronage provides many incumbents with governability and electoral advantage. What causes governments to forsake patronage in favour of civil service reform? This article reviews scholarly explanations. It finds that studies usefully identify diverse socioeconomic and political-institutional factors which can affect reform incentives. The causal effects of these factors – their weight, mechanisms and signs – are contested, however. This article partially resolves this contestation by considering which reform studies explain: different bureaucratic structures develop asynchronously and feature different determinants. To illustrate, political competition is argued to incentivize reform to ‘blanket in’ party appointees; or do the opposite by reducing expectations to reap longer-term state capacity benefits. Yet, ‘blanketing in’ necessitates bureaucratic job stability, while state capacity requires merit recruitment of skilled bureaucrats – two poorly correlated reforms. The causes of patronage reform thus depend on the type of civil service reform. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - The article examines debates surrounding the current family law reform in Mali to account for the way in which broader processes of social change, an international and national context of women's rights activism, as well as various interest groups will shape the ultimate outcome of legislative reform. The article focuses on the five main components of the proposed reform and analyzes the positions of the most important groups participating in the debate: women's rights activists supported by the international women's movement and international donor organizations, protagonists of the two influential wings of the national Muslim organization, and representatives of the state administration. It is argued that although state officials and protagonists of an "Islamic" position hold divergent ideological and normative orientations, they form temporary and shifting alliances around certain issues, often on the basis of pragmatic considerations. Also, while women's rights activists and "Muslim women" claim to represent women tout court, the positions and arguments of the former can be seen as representing particularistic, class-specific interests.

N2  - This article examines the discretionary power of national governments in EU policy making, focusing on the preparatory stage of European legislation. We assess the conditions under which the ministry in charge of the pre-negotiations is able to withstand attempts of domestic stakeholders to change the national bargaining stance. Our case studies and multivariate regressions on 15 legislative proposals show that the overall conflict between domestic stakeholders and pressure from powerful interest groups make such changes more likely. Parliamentary actors and parties do, conversely, not possess much power in these often technical deliberations. Although governments and their bureaucracies have to yield in some situations, they possess ample discretion in the average decision-making process. We illustrate our findings with a comparative case study on the controversial attempt by the Commission to regulate the usage of PVC softeners in toys.

N2  - In the twentieth century, big business in Mexico invested much more in voluntary encompassing associations than business did elsewhere in Latin America. Multisectoral associations like the CCE, the CMNH, Coparmex, and COECE are rare in the other large countries of the region. Three primary factors gave Mexican business stronger incentives to invest in these associations. First, Mexican business was excluded from elections, PRI politics, and appointments to top government positions and therefore relied more on associations to channel business's organized participation in politics and policy making. Second, in some periods, government actions were threatening to business interests and prompted defensive organization. Third, in other periods of closer cooperation between business and government, government officials relied heavily on these associations to mediate relations with business, giving big business further incentives to invest in associations.

N2  - What determines whether interest groups choose to contact politicians or bureaucrats? Despite the importance of this question for policymaking, democracy, and some prominent principal-agent understandings of politics, it is relatively unexplored in the literature. We argue that government stability plays a major part in interest groups' decisions. That is, central to interest groups' decisions is their assessment of the likelihood that politicians currently in power will continue to be in the future. We deduce logical, but totally contrasting hypotheses, about how interest groups lobby under such conditions of uncertainty and then test these using a heteroskedastic probit model that we apply to a unique longitudinal survey of interest groups in Japan. We find that when it is unclear if the party controlling the government will maintain power in the future, interest groups are more likely to contact the bureaucracy. When it is believed that the party in power will retain control for a considerable period, interest groups are more inclined to contact politicians. In addition, during times of government uncertainty, interest groups that are supportive of the governing party (or parties) are more likely to contact politicians and those that are less supportive will be more likely to contact bureaucrats.

N2  - The article investigates the Estonian government's response to the fiscal crisis by looking at the dynamics of the decision-making processes during cutback management from 2008 to 2013 from the dichotomy of centralization-decentralization. The study explores the cutback decision-making by pinpointing the main actors and contextual variables shedding light on the management of fiscal crisis. It is demonstrated that, in general, the fiscal crisis contributed to increasing levels of centralization in governmental decision-making. The crisis decision-making was dominated by centralized political decisions and non-inclusion of the opposition and interest groups. Still, achieving urgent solutions was facilitated by decentralized decisions at the ministerial level, the empowerment of budgetary institutions and the intensive engagement of the civil servants. It has been indicated that the initially short-term procedures to enable cuts and resultant changes in decision-making processes are mostly in effect still in 2014 and thereby influence public administration practices in the long run. Points for practitioners The study shows that cutback management may lead to urgency in governmental decision-making, where centralization facilitates quick decisions. It is also demonstrated that a minority government is able to achieve fiscal adjustment even in a context of high political conflict. The crisis context sets new requirements to the competencies of public servants, as cutback management obliges them to cope with new and very complicated tasks. The article indicates that short-term cuts and changes in decision-making processes intended to alleviate the acute phase of crisis may remain in effect considerably longer than initially planned and thereby influence public administration practices in the long run.

N2  - This study is aimed to investigate the regional pressure groups' effect on the government size in Turkey. According to the public choice theory, elections, political parties, interest and pressure groups, and bureaucracy significantly affect the public production process. Among these actors, pressure and interest groups directly affect variables such as economic growth and public expenditures. In this study, panel data analysis was used to observe the regional effect. The research data set covered 81 provinces of Turkey and the period between 2006 and 2018. According to the results, it was found that interest and pressure groups increase the public expenditures in the less developed regions in Turkey. These results are consistent with the empirical and theoretical studies. For this reason, the study has an important contribution to the literature. This study offers significant conclusions that public economic policies might be under the influence of interest and pressure groups. Even if stated that the results of this study might have many economic, demographic, social, and political reasons regarding Turkey, in the context of public choice theory, it could be seen as a significant indicator of not using public expenditure policies as efficient instruments. This situation shows that public resources are not used efficiently in Turkey and the government has a negative effect on the economy. To eradicate this negative effect, governments coming to power in the future ought to produce economic, political, and social policies in order to decrease the regional differences dramatically in Turkey.

N2  - Much commentary on Indonesian politics since the fall of President Suharto in May 1998 has suggested that Indonesia's political system has remained just as exclusionary as it was prior to his fall, despite becoming much more democratic and decentralised. In contrast to this view, we argue that Indonesia's political system has become more inclusive, if only somewhat more so. The fall of Suharto and the subsequent process of democratisation have removed key obstacles to organisation by poor and disadvantaged groups and their NGO allies, making it easier for them to engage in collective action aimed at achieving pro-poor policy change. By making attainment of political office dependent on the support of the voting public, many of whom are poor and disadvantaged, these developments have also created an incentive for politicians to pursue policy changes that favour these groups or at least that appeal to them. At the same time, however, we argue that poor and disadvantaged groups have not become major players in the policy-making process. Despite the fall of Suharto and democratisation, these groups continue to lack the resources possessed by other participants in the policy-making process. Whereas the politico-bureaucrats and well-connected business groups have been able to exercise influence over policy by buying support within representative bodies such as parliament and mobile capita controllers, the IFIs and Western governments have been able to exercise influence by virtue of their structural power, poor and disadvantaged groups have had to rely on less potent ways of exercising influence such as holding demonstrations, engaging in lobbying activity and participating in public debates. We illustrate these points with reference to two policy issues: land reform and mining in protected forests. The article concludes by considering the future prospects for inclusive policy-making in Indonesia.

N2  - The Foreign Agents Registration Act ("FARA") is a sweeping and generally underenforced public-disclosure statute. Enacted in 1938, FARA was used during World War II to target fascist propaganda, but by the 1960s its enforcement had shifted to lobbyists and public-relations firms for foreign governments. After the 2016 presidential election, FARA has gained favor among policymakers and prosecutors as a central tool to respond to a range of foreign influence in U.S. politics, including foreign lobbying, electioneering, and disinformation. This Article argues that FARA's breadth creates substantial risk that it will be used in a politicized manner. In the past decade, analogous transparency laws in other countries-often justified by reference to FARA-have been weaponized to target dissenting voices with the stigma and burden of registering as a "foreign agent. " This Article undertakes an analysis of FARA to show how its broad and unclear provisions make FARA susceptible to being similarly used in the United States, especially against nonprofits, the media, and public officials. It examines three cases in which FARA was arguably enforced in a politicized manner, explains why strengthening the Act's enforcement would likely exacerbate this problem, and discusses the Act's potential constitutional deficiencies under the Supreme Court's recent First Amendment jurisprudence. The Article ends by weighing the merits of using FARA to address different types of foreign influence. It posits that transparency provisions like those in FARA are most appropriate, and on strongest ground, when applied to (1) those who clearly are acting at the direction or control of a foreign government or political party; and (2) when the covered activity involves core democratic processes, such as lobbying or electioneering. It warns that using FARA to target disinformation is unlikely to be effective and presents a high risk of politicized abuse. Based on these insights, it suggests three potential strategies for FARA reform.

N2  - Regional labour councils have been involved in building labour-community coalitions. The case study of the South Coast Labour Council demonstrates that a regional labour council can engage in a broader make-up of lobbying partners than is generally recognised in the literature, which includes labour-community coalitions that are not geographically, politically or socially close. The South Coast Labour Council did not focus on employer opposition, as is usually the case with building labour-community coalitions, but rather, it focused on lobbying farmers to increase pressure on government officials for the siting of a grain terminal in Port Kembla, near Wollongong in the Illawarra region of NSW. It pursued broader aims of labour-community coalitions to include local employment generation.

N2  - The paper argues that the introduction of bureaucracy civilized death penalty and brutal punishment. The study bases on a quantitative analysis of the numbers of death sentences and executions in England and Habsburg Austria from 1700 to 1914 and on a qualitative analysis of historical literature about the death penalty in both countries. The paper shows that professional law enforcement specialists, bureaucrats, civil servants, and detached juridical stuff formed a new class of ``domesticated middlemen elites''. In strong states, this new class becomes the dominating group. In weak states, however, old elites that combine economic and political power preserve their privileged positions. For them capital punishment is the most proper mean to deter criminals because old elites fear the alternative: the introduction of strong-state institutions. Beside obvious power struggles between central and local elites-which effects penal policy pro and con capital punishment-there is a civilizing process going beneath the surface of rationality and political interests. In strong states, the formation of a ``habitus'' averse to brutal punishment is initiated amongst ``domesticated middlemen elites'' who are acting in peaceful living- and working conditions.

N2  - Under political uncertainty, legislative coalitions have incentives to insulate policy from future coalitions. While there is evidence of legislators' use of agency design to insulate the bureaucracy from elected officials, little is known about the ultimate consequences of such design choices on the policy participation of interest groups. How such design choices affect group access is important because of the centrality of groups in providing both bureaucratic accountability and information for policy development. Accordingly, we examine the consequences of the so-called "insulation game" on group access to the bureaucracy. We develop an information exchange theory that portrays the impact of agency design choices on group-reported access as a function of the level of design-induced political insulation and the quality of the information offered by a given group. We test our theory with two original datasets that include design parameters of US state environmental agencies and survey data measuring reported agency access by state-level interest groups. Our results suggest that insulating agencies via design does lead to lower reported access to regulators by interest groups, but only among those groups who supply less valuable information.

Not only have private healthcare expenditures risen more swiftly than government healthcare expenditure but, from 1982, public funds have also been used to purchase private services from public hospitals However, unlike simple class analyses, class contention manifesting through alliances between politicians, bureaucrats and capitalists has been a major force behind healthcare privatisation in Malaysia. The source of these developments can be traced to power wielded by the government to quicken the creation of a Bumiputera capitalist class that began to gain momentum from the late 1970s.

N2  - Interest groups may approach political decision makers in two phases of the legislative process: the pre-parliamentary, administrative phase, in which bills are prepared by bureaucrats; and the parliamentary phase, in which bills are discussed and possibly revised by parliamentary committees. The article investigates the factors that lead groups to engage in these phases based on group proceedings for 225 bills presented to the Danish parliament in the 2009/2010 session. We conclude that resourceful groups are clearly more active in both arenas, but the parliamentary arena is also a venue for voicing discontent and defending gains achieved in the administrative arena. © 2014 The Comparative Legislative Research Center of The University of Iowa.

N2  - Thailand's recent administrative reforms are analyzed in a context of the legacies of its bureaucratic institutions. Traditional Thai bureaucratic culture is characterized by patrimonialism, departmentalism and legal proceduralism, with bureaucratic power and status legitimized by myths and symbols of service to the monarchy. But the realities of bureaucratic performance (including corruption) have provided a strong stimulus for reform. Since the 1990s, reforms have been strongly influenced by New Public Management (NPM), albeit in a bureaucratic environment hostile to their imposition. International institutions such as the IMF were instrumental in introducing some of the new ideas. Under the governments of Thaksin Shinawatra, such reforms (selectively applied) gained pace due to the imposition of a clear political purpose: centralization of decision-making power (including patronage) in the hands of Thaksin and his immediate circle. The impact of these waves of reform was softened by a combination of the power of bureaucratic conservatives and by their association at first with 'foreign' forces and later with the 'political excesses' of Thaksin. The recent military coup and its aftermath represent a revival of some aspects of Thailand's bureaucratic traditions and hence an interruption to the globalizing, modernizing trajectory of the reforms.

N2  - Public policies are fundamental to spur the use of biomass and make it competitive to face traditional commercial fossil fuels. This article analyzes the policymaking process of the Brazilian National Alcohol Policy (Proalcool). Proalcool is one of the world's most ambitious efforts to produce a renewable biomass fuel as an oil substitute. In the 1970s, after the oil crisis and the sharp increase in fuel prices, the Brazilian government started intensifying its policy to substitute sugarcane alcohol for gasoline in automobile use. Through a set of governmental interventions to increase alcohol demand and supply, Brazil created some competitive assets that made Proalcool a relative success in terms of developing institutional and technological capabilities for using renewable energy in large scale. Several key actors influenced the policy directions, such as the central and state governments, military groups, the alcohol industry, sugarcane agricultural aristocracy, bureaucrats, researchers and the media. Instead of thinking of Proalcool as a government decision based only on economic rationale or interests of few decision-makers, the elaboration and implementation of this alcohol policy could be thought of as the result of a policymaking process where the different stakeholders involved in the process with their values, interests and knowledge interacted with each other according to the political, social, technological and economic situation.

N2  - There is limited empirical research on the extent to which politicized recruitment of ministerial advisers affects the quality of the policy process. In this article we take a novel step by looking at two possible consequences of increased political recruitment for the policy process: administrative politicization and contestability. We deploy a Most Similar Systems comparison of Denmark and Sweden and include survey answers from 657 civil servants in managerial positions. We find that political recruitment of top civil servants, such as Swedish state secretaries, restricts the access of the civil service to the minister, but it does not substantially politicize the policy process. Danish civil servants perceive themselves as more contested by the relatively few Danish political advisers than their Swedish colleagues. Our results imply that the organization of political advice is a crucial factor for politicization and contestability

N2  - Why have some Republican-controlled states controlled expanded Medicaid while others have not? Research into state expansion decisions has emphasized partisanship, interest groups, legislative professionalization, and available resources. In contrast, we evaluate the impact of political institutions, which are rules that govern how officials reach policy decisions. We explain how different state institutional structures can lead to different expansion decisions, given similar partisan control patterns. We describe varying gubernatorial powers over Medicaid programs and analyze the potential of voter-led initiatives to impose expansion on recalcitrant elected officials. Finally, we describe how politicians change rules to make it more likely that their preferences are enacted. Overall, focusing on institutions in addition to partisanship and interest groups more effectively illuminates the expansion prospects in holdout states. This allows for an effective illustration of potential roadmaps and roadblocks for pursuing both Medicaid expansion and other state-level health reforms that can improve access and equity of health care.

In the second half, we address the following research question: What factors affect the lobbying behavior of state lobbyists? Our results suggest a number of conclusions about lobbying in the new millennium, including the following: (1) state lobbyists target the governor's office more than most previous studies suggest; (2) state lobbyists aim their grassroots lobbying efforts at the governor and executive agency bureaucrats as well as legislators; (3) state lobbying remains an intensely personal game, as techniques involving face-to-face contact with government officials remain the most effective; and (4) several variables affect a lobbyist's decisions regarding which techniques to use and where to aim his or her efforts, including the receptivity of potential targets and the type of group for which the lobbyist works.

N2  - Confirmation politics for judicial appointees is an exhaustively studied phenomenon, but the politics of appointment for independent agencies is less well understood, because nominees are very rarely rejected and the Senate fails even to hold a recorded vote for most appointees. However, alternative evidence of conflict between the president and the Senate is available: the length of time it takes to fill a vacancy on a board or commission. An empirical assessment of FCC vacancies, based on an exponential regression model of vacancy duration, demonstrates that statutory restrictions on the partisanship of the board significantly deteriorate the efficiency of the appointment process. In addition, the appointment of minorities (though not of women) occurs only after unusually drawn-out appointments. A straightforward test of whether divided government leads to extended vacancies turns up negative.

N2  - The article examines the effect of meritocratic recruitment and tenure protection in public bureaucracies on regulatory quality and business entry rates in a global sample. Utilizing a cross-country measure on the extent of meritocratic entry to bureaucracy and a time-series indicator of tenure protection, it subjects theoretical claims that these features improve the epistemic qualities of bureaucracies and also serve as a credible commitment device to empirical test. We find that, conditional on a number of economic, political, and legal factors, countries where bureaucracies are more insulated from day-to-day oversight by individual politicians through the institutional features under consideration tend to have both better regulation, specifically business regulation, and higher rates of business entry. Our findings suggest that bureaucratic structure has an indirect effect on entrepreneurship rates through better regulatory quality, but also exert a direct independent effect.

N2  - Voters reward or punish politicians by deeming them responsible for positive and negative outcomes, but how, in turn, do politicians attribute responsibility to those who actually deliver public services? Inattention to this question renders incomplete current perspectives on democratic processes of accountability, even as politicians are increasingly provided with performance data to hold bureaucrats accountable. We shed light on this issue using a survey experiment of elected officials featuring actual performance data. We find that the provision of performance data makes elected officials more willing to attribute causal responsibility to bureaucratic leaders, but only in cases of low performance, suggesting a negativity bias in public sector responsibility attribution processes. Additionally, we offer evidence that interest group advocates influence how elected officials use performance information to attribute responsibility, but contingent on ideological alignment.

N2  - Electoral coordination is central to the creation of national party systems under first-past-the-post rules, but there are instances where we see such coordination fail even at the constituency level. In this article, we argue that electoral coordination requires partisan control of patronage distribution by local bureaucracies. In electoral constituencies in which bureaucrats do not hold a monopoly over the distribution of patronage, we might see constituency-level electoral fragmentation. In constituencies in which the bureaucracy controls patronage, however, effective coordination yields Duvergerian equilibria. We formulate and test this argument through constituency- and precinct-level analysis of Pakistani elections and additional evidence from Indian elections.

N2  - Do agencies implement the president's particularistic goals uniformly? This paper clarifies the presidential particularism literature by explicitly considering the mechanism through which the president pursues their policy goals: Executive agencies. The constellation of bureaucratic agencies responsible for allocating grants plays a key role in facilitating or frustrating presidential policy priorities. Using a dataset of 21 agencies over 14 years, I find that only agencies ideologically proximate to the president engage in particularism benefiting the president. I find no evidence that politicization influences agency implementation of particularism. Critically, the moderating effect of the bureaucracy on particularism only occurs for distributive programs over which agencies have discretion. When disbursing formula grants written by Congress but administered by the bureaucracy with little or no discretion, ideological distance between agencies and presidents has no effect on particularism.

N2  - Why do some interest groups lobby politicians and others lobby bureaucrats ? We theorize lobbying venue choices and intensity as a function of contract enforceability with policy makers, politicians, or bureaucrats. We argue that organizational structures of interest groups, in particular, whether they are centralized or decentralized, substantially affect their lobbying strategies because they are associated with different ability to monitor and enforce contracts with policy makers and punish them when they fail. We further demonstrate that the effect of centralized versus decentralized structure on venue choices is conditional on the types of electoral system: majoritarian, semiproportional (single, nontransferable vote: SNTV), or proportional representation systems. We test this argument using longitudinal survey data on lobbying which span two decades and cover around 250 interest groups in various sectors and issue areas in Japan. The results lend strong support to our argument about contract enforceability under alternative electoral systems.

N2  - This article uses the South African case to look at the concept of descriptive representation-an important element in the theory of representative bureaucracy. Considerable literature has examined the relationship between descriptive representation, or the number of members of an identity group that are present in a public sector organization, and active representation, the extent to which those representatives pursue the interests of those they are presumed to represent. Less studied is the descriptive representation side of the equation. Descriptive representation should not be seen as simply a matter of counting the numbers of members of identity groups in an organization. Rather, one should also ask whether the identity groups that are to be privileged for representation make sense. This article explores the extent to which challenges in identity formation and classification alter passive representation and the potential for active representation. We consider how those targeted for representation in the new democratic South Africa are defined and the tension and issues the definition has caused for the government's stated policy of achieving a representative public service.

N2  - The representation of specific groups and social interests within (or by) the civil service has long been a concern of public administration scholarship. Yet, much of this literature focuses on representation at a single point in time. In this article, we propose a more dynamic perspective. In terms of theory, we postulate specific temporal relationships between triggering cues (e.g., a crisis event) and the representation decisions of civil servants. We specify two complementary mechanisms underlying these relationships: that is, a sensemaking process whereby the perceived meaning and relative salience of distinct groups and interests changes over time; and a shift in bureaucrats' discretion to represent specific groups or interests changes over time. We illustrate these time-dependent processes using interview and survey data from the European Commission.

N2  - This article suggests a new concept of measurement for the EU's oft-alleged democratic deficit based on two contributions. First, we turn attention to the administrative staff involved in policy-making rather than the (un)accountability of EUs' parliamentarians and executive agents. Second, building on the idea that policy-makers' legitimacy depends on the extent to which they can claim to represent some groups or social interests, we assess the extent to which Commission officials' preferences reflect European citizens' policy stance. Our results indicate a statistically significant positive correlation between the policy preferences of EU administrative staff and their home country population, which, we argue, can provide EU administrators a basic degree of legitimacy relative to their home country.

N2  - The most important administrative aspect of the George W. Bush presidency was not its formal management reform agenda, but its attempt to extend the politicized presidency. Efforts to assert tighter political control of the federal bureaucracy, revived during the Ronald Reagan administration, were pursued to an extreme under Bush. Loyalty triumphed over competence in selection, and political goals displaced rationality in decision making. However, the strategy of politicization undermined the Bush administration's own policy goals as well as its broader agenda to restore the strength of the institutional presidency. This apparent failure of strategy signals the urgent necessity for a fundamental reconsideration of the politicized presidency.

N2  - The article shows that civil servants who believe that the long-term interest of society is best served by their detached policy advice to policy-makers also hold on to their opinion more than any other actor involved in policy development. However, more civil servants currently emphasise responsiveness, at the expense of detached analysis, owing to increased exposure to international consultancy and forums. As a consequence, the attitude of civil servants in developing public policy is more likely to be indistinguishable from that of actors who have political functions, without significant variation from country to country. Evidence supporting this argument is provided by an analysis of the results of a survey first conducted in 2006 and repeated in 2008. The two waves of the survey drew responses from civil servants, interest group representatives and non-governmental experts who contribute to biotechnology policy development in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and the European Union.

N2  - This paper examines the impact of democratic backsliding on the management of top officials in Hungary. Based on a unique data set of more than 1,600 top officials the article shows that the number of appointments to top positions increased in 2010 and subsequent years, during which Hungary experienced democratic backsliding. Moreover, the data shows that turnover in top official positions was higher in 2010 and in subsequent years than in the period between 1990 and 2010. The paper concludes that the politicisation and high degree of instability in top official positions may be characteristic of governance in illiberal democracies. © 2020 Jan-Hinrik Meyer-Sahling, Fanni Toth, published by Sciendo.

N2  - Research on bureaucracy and corruption tends to concentrate on cross-national research taking countries as the unit of analysis. Yet national-level measures neglect large differences within countries. This article therefore takes the perspective of individual bureaucrats. It studies how public officials' experience with bureaucratic institutions affects corruption within their sphere of work. Based on a survey of central government officials in five post-communist states, the article examines how public servants' views on civil service laws, the quality of their implementation, merit recruitment, and the politicization of appointments associate with rumours of kickbacks in their place of work. The analysis shows that merit recruitment is associated with less corruption, while politicization is associated with more corruption. In contrast, civil service laws are negatively associated with corruption only if they are properly implemented. The findings complement and qualify country-level research, approaching more closely the micro-foundations of the relation between bureaucracy and corruption.

N2  - This article examines claims that senior civil services in post-communist Europe are subject to instability and politicisation, and that both features are at the centre of what amounts to the emergence of a distinct type of executive governance different from Western traditions. At the conceptual level, the article develops four modes of politicisation that differ with respect to the political control over the making and breaking of bureaucratic careers. Modes of politicisation serve as an analytical tool to assess and classify the politicisation of post-communist senior civil services and to compare them to prevailing modes of politicisation in Western democracies as well as the communist past. At the empirical level, the article examines the politicisation of the senior civil service in post-communist Hungary. It argues that the politicisation of the Hungarian senior civil service is characterised by high turnover, recruitment of outsiders and heavy reliance on the appointment of officials who come and go with their bloc of political parties while bridging the out-of-office period in the private sector, academia or at a political party. The article concludes that the politicisation of the senior civil service in post-communist Hungary has more in common with the communist past than with the prevailing modes of politicisation in Western democracies. The main difference from the communist era lies in the periodically changing political colours of the post-communist state.

N2  - It is problematic to classify the relationship between political parties and the state in post-communist Hungary as a case of low or no party patronage and state politicization. A study of the ministerial bureaucracy reveals that the passing of public administration reforms has not provided an effective constraint against politicization, and that the politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy has increased over time in terms of extent, intensity and scope. Comparison of four post-communist governments in Hungary permits one to relate the politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy to the desire of governing parties to enhance their political control over the formulation and implementation of public policies under conditions of polarized political competition between former communists and their political allies, on the one side, and anti-communist parties, on the other.

N2  - The federal appointments process is having its proverbial day in the sun. The appointment and removal of federal officers figured centrally in the Supreme Court's two major recent separation-of-powers decisions, Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning. The appointments process has featured even more prominently in the political sphere, figuring in a number of congressional-presidential confrontations. Such simultaneous top billing in the judicial and political spheres is hardly coincidental. After all, it was President Obama's use of the Recess Appointments Clause in response to pro forma sessions that triggered the Court's engagement with the Clause in Noel Canning. But the relationship between the Clause's judicial and political manifestations is more complicated, and more fraught, than mere practical causality. The Roberts Court's approach to appointments and separation of powers issues stands out for its Burkean resistance to innovation. By contrast, the dominant characteristic of appointments in the political sphere is novelty and embrace of new institutional arrangements. This Article explores these differing judicial and political approaches to innovation, and the implications of the emerging contrast for federal administration. Although the Court's resistance to innovation might appear a useful prophylactic against efforts to bend the Constitution in the name of political expediency, the constitutional basis for such a general suspicion of innovation is lacking. Particularly given the political transformations occurring in response to polarization, a stance of suspicion sets the Court on a course of confrontation with the other two branches that is hard to justify. A more nuanced approach that pays greater attention to political reality would allow the Court to both better titrate its interventions to constitutional structure and minimize the disruptive effects of its decisions.

N2  - Objective: To describe the strategies pursued by the tobacco industry (TI) to interfere with the ratification of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in Argentina. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews about the FCTC, the TI and the legislative process with 3 legislators, 4 public health officials, 1 representative of the tobacco growers and two tobacco control advocates. We reviewed 6 newspapers from the 4 tobacco growing provinces, searched TI documents in the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and reviewed 1624 documents. Proposed legislation and related documents on tobacco control from Argentina's National Congress and the Provincial Jujuy Congress were reviewed. Results: The principal strategy used by the TI was lobbying of provincial legislators and federal officials from the Ministry of the Economy by the tobacco growers associations. These legislators prevented the passage of comprehensive bills on tobacco control or of less comprehensive national laws. A typical legislative strategy used was to request additional analyses of the proposed bills from committees that prioritized economic issues over health. FCTC was mentioned in regional newspapers three to seven times per week in articles about alleged adverse economic effects of tobacco control. Direct physical threats to legislators who were openly supportive of FCTC ratification were made. Conclusion: Tobacco producers and TI opposed FCTC ratification in Argentina by lobbying elected representatives and placing stories in regional media to obstruct approval of tobacco control laws. These activities have led to a delay in consideration of Argentina's ratification of the FCTC despite the President's signature in 2003. © 2008 World Heart Federation.

N2  - Previous studies have identified institutional, organizational, and individual factors that promote innovation in public organizations. Yet they have overlooked how the type of public administration—and the type of administrators—is associated with innovative attitudes. Using two large, unique comparative data sets on public bureaucracies and public managers, this article examines how bureaucratic politicization and legalistic features are associated with senior public managers’ attitudes toward innovation in 19 European countries. Results of multilevel analysis indicate that the bureaucratic politicization of an administration and the law background of public managers matter. Public managers working in politicized administrations and those whose education includes a law degree exhibit lower pro-innovation attitudes (i.e., receptiveness to new ideas and creative solutions and change orientation).

N2  - This Research Note presents a new dataset of party patronage in 22 countries from five regions. The data was collected using the same methodology to compare patterns of patronage within countries, across countries and across world regions that are usually studied separately. The Note addresses three research questions that are at the centre of debates on party patronage, which is understood as the power of political parties to make appointments to the public and semi-public sector: the scope of patronage, the underlying motivations and the criteria on the basis of which appointees are selected. The exploration of the dataset shows that party patronage is, to a different degree, widespread across all regions. The data further shows differences between policy areas, types of institutions such as government ministries, agencies and state-owned enterprises, and higher, middle and lower ranks of the bureaucracy. It is demonstrated that the political control of policy making and implementation is the most common motivation for making political appointments. However, in countries with a large scope of patronage, appointments serve the purpose of both political control and rewarding supporters in exchange for votes and services. Finally, the data shows that parties prefer to select appointees who are characterised by political and personal loyalty as well as professional competence.

N2  - Public choice submits that legal changes can be endogenous in such a way that they are manipulated by bureaucrats who want to maximize rents from transactions with various interest groups. This paper takes the change in exchange rate regimes to empirically examine the premise. It offers a two-stage method, in which we first show that the exchange rate is influenced by interest group pressures, and subsequently that the 1990 market average regime (MAR), as a phase-in policy in Korea, was introduced mainly to serve bureaucratic incentives. This method is expected to be useful to a host of countries for various studies attempting to test a possible existence of bureaucratic or other hidden motivations behind any "isolated" event of policy change.

N2  - Intense competition can compel lobbyists to exaggerate the benefits the government would see in tax returns and social welfare if agency officials allocate such resources to the lobbyist's members. This incentive to misrepresent grows when information asymmetry exists between lobbyists and government officials. A large body of literature has investigated how interest groups compete and interact, but it disregards the interdependency of interests between competing groups and associated strategic behaviors of other players. Our signaling model of lobbying reveals ways in which agency officials can compel lobbyists for competing interests to lobby truthfully and what the policy implications of this compulsion can be.We also present case-study evidence of how this works in practice.

N2  - When interest groups compete to influence legislators, the resulting legislation is often vague, and thus obliges the groups to continue their fight in the executive. On its face, this seems inefficient-at least from the point of view of the groups. We explore this intuition in a model of "nested lobbying" in which interest groups first compete to influence a legislative agenda setter, then compete to influence legislative votes over the resulting agenda. If the resulting legislation grants discretion to the executive, the final prize is allocated in yet one more contest in the bureaucracy. We find that when the status quo is non-discretionary, competition over the agenda never results in an agenda that includes discretion. Surprisingly, however, a discretionary status quo can stand with probability 1 if the preferences of the bureaucracy, the legislature, and the agenda setter are arranged in an "iron triangle". Specifically, the bureaucracy and agenda setter must be biased in favor of one group, while the legislature is biased in favor of the other.

N2  - Existing research on distributive politics mainly focuses on the influence of electoral competition between political parties, but less is known about non-electoral mechanisms of resource allocation inside a dominant party. This study examines how informal patron–client networks within the ruling Communist Party shape the distribution of intergovernmental transfers in China, a major one-party regime. Using a new dataset on city-level fiscal transfers and a novel method to infer informal political connections through past promotions, we show that provincial leaders allocate significantly more transfers to localities governed by officials who are part of their networks. This bias persists even when we use a specification that only exploits variations in connection caused by exogenous turnovers of higher level leadership. We evaluate two plausible motivations behind this bias—network-based policy coordination and collective corruption—and find evidence in stronger support of the former. Our findings suggest that private networks may function as an important, albeit costly, tool of mobilization in one-party systems.

N2  - What role do bureaucrats play in the development of the resource curse in countries that have recently discovered oil? Much of the resource curse literature argues that political leaders spend natural resource revenue in ways that entrench their political power but undermine longer-term economic development. This literature has largely overlooked the role of bureaucrats – those responsible for the day-to-day operations of the state. Bureaucrats may support or constrain political spending in ways that minimize the resource curse. Using results of a survey experiment with over 3000 government employees in Ghana and Uganda, two countries with recent oil and gas discoveries, we find that bureaucrats treated with information on oil revenue are more likely to disapprove of spending practices that benefit political supporters. The results also suggest that material motivations may be at play: bureaucrats in Uganda who are secure in their jobs and outside of government patronage networks are most likely to oppose the political use of oil revenue. These findings challenge unitary state assumptions underlying much of the resource curse literature, especially for new oil producers. They also suggest that policymakers ought to engage civil servants in efforts to avoid or curtail the resource curse.

N2  - European Commission expert groups provide powerful platforms from which interest organisations can steer the EU consultation process and weigh in on policy outcomes. Commission decision-makers and bureaucrats rely heavily on expert groups to provide expert policy advice on highly technical issues in the early stages of the policymaking process. Interest organisations provide this advice in order to have their voices heard at the EU level. But whose interests are being represented in these expert groups? Which types of interest organisations, in other words, get a seat at the table and why? This article, using data on over 800 expert groups and nearly 3,000 interest organisations, argues that expert group membership is largely a function of superior resources, EU-level interests and existing institutionalised ties to decision-makers. Far from simply addressing the Commission's need for expertise, expert group membership is more a story of capital and capture.

N2  - One of the important roles which firm boards play is the resource provision role. In this study, we examine influence capital, a specific form of resource provision on boards. Two categories of government officials, i.e., Politicians and Bureaucrats tend to be the major providers of influence capital. While firm connections to politicians as board members has been examined in prior literature, connections to bureaucrats (and ex-bureaucrats) has not received the same level of attention. This is despite a sharp increase in the appointment of bureaucrats in company boards in the last few years. We analyze and provide evidence that industry regulation and foreign corporate ownership are major organizational determinants of selection of bureaucrats as board members. Further, it was also imperative to understand the differences in selection of various categories of bureaucrats as board members. We examined and find that generalist bureaucrats are more sought after by firms than specialist bureaucrats, usually as independent directors. Overall, this study provides an important initial thrust for studying bureaucrat board members as providers of influence capital.

N2  - Patronage has been interpreted as an important dimension of the party government model. However, patronage has been conventionally associated with the distribution of jobs in public administration aiming to reward services rendered to the party in government. This is not entirely satisfactory. The growing complexity of governance processes, together with the growing influence of the upper echelons of the civil service in policy making has prompted politicians to search for new ways of controlling the bureaucracy. Through the use of elite interviews, this article seeks to analyze the emergence of an instrumental dimension of patronage, as a potential key resource for parties in government to control the policy-making process and retain a role in modern democratic governance.
