Numerous studies assess under which conditions politicians share citizens’ ideological preferences. However, under which conditions bureaucrats share citizens’ ideological preferences has not been systematically studied. Yet, bureaucratic preferences shape policy outcomes. Our paper thus studies why bureaucrats are more right or left-wing than citizens in some countries and points of time, yet not others. We theorize that political ideologies of past incumbents shape this variation. Incumbents can select ideologically aligned bureaucrats and socialize bureaucrats into ideological preferences; moreover, prospective bureaucrats may self-select into ideologically aligned governments. As bureaucratic tenure exceeds political tenure, this politicization has lasting effects. Survey data from 87 countries supports this argument: bureaucrats are more left-leaning than citizens in countries with longer prior rule by economically left-wing governments, and more right-wing in countries with more authoritarian pasts. This suggests that incumbents continue to shape the ideological preferences of bureaucrats after leaving office. © 2021 European Consortium for Political Research.","bureaucracy; ideological congruence; political control; representation",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J., Putnam, R., Rockman, B., (1981) Bureaucrats and politicians in western democracies, , &, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Adorno, T., Frenkel-Brenswik, E., Levinson, D.J., Sanford, R.N., (1950) The authoritarian personality, , &, London, UK, Harper; Albertus, M., The fate of former authoritarian elites under democracy (2019) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 63 (3), pp. 727-759; Albertus, M., Menaldo, V., (2018) Authoritarianism and the elite origins of democracy, , &, Cambridge, MA, Cambridge University Press; Baekgaard, M., Blom-Hansen, J., Serritzlew, S., When politics matters: The impact of politicians' and bureaucrats' preferences on salient and nonsalient policy areas (2015) Governance, 28 (4), pp. 459-474; Bakker, R., de Vries, C., Edwards, E., Hooghe, L., Jolly, S., Marks, G., Polk, J., Vachudova, M., Measuring party positions in Europe (2015) Party Politics, 21 (1), pp. 143-152; Barfort, S., Harmon, N., Hjorth, F., Olsen, A., Sustaining honesty in public service: The role of selection (2019) American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 11 (4), pp. 96-123; Bednarczuk, M., Ideology, vote choice, and bureaucracy across time (2015) Administration & Society, 50 (6), pp. 812-834; Blais, A., Blake, D., Dion, S., The public/private sector cleavage in North America (1990) Comparative Political Studies, 23 (3), pp. 381-403; Blais, A., Bodet, M., Does proportional representation foster closer congruence between citizens and policy makers?

To get at the politicization of environmental concerns in the 1970s, the article compares two narratives: the ‘technocratic invention’ of environmental politics by government officials, and the career of grassroots anti-nuclear activism. It shows that though these two trends developed in relationship with one another, their protagonists increasingly came to speak past one other. Not only did they begin to understand environmental problems in different ways, they also drew different conclusions about where environmental matters were to be debated, and what ought to be done in order to resolve environmental concerns. By describing these developments and the approaches to environmental politics they brought forth, the article reconceives the ecological revolution as an extended period when conflicting interpretations of environmental affairs underpinned competing approaches to politics as such. While government officials sought to make the environment part of standard political praxis, grassroots activists used environmental concerns as a wedge to push open a wider debate about popular participation within parliamentary democracy. The long confrontation between these two perspectives gave way, during the 1980s, to an environmentalism that was not only level-headed and consensual, but also a seminal concern of German politics. © The Author(s) 2022.","Anti-nuclear movement; citizens’ initiatives; ecological revolution; environmental policy; modern environmentalism; the Greens; West Germany",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: 423371999",,,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,02656914,,,,"English","Eur.

Its endogenous flaws resulted in its politicization in the 1970s, and again in the 1990s, leading to an increasingly technicized form of global governance. The great financial crisis was even more disruptive and accelerated a shift toward increasingly volatile interactions between the spheres of technocracy and politics. Complex global problems requiring long time-horizons are dealt with by increasingly narrowly focused technical specialists, dominated by corporatized bureaucracies operating in public-private symbiosis; while in the sphere of politics, a wider public seeks simple solutions and mistrusts experts, with good reason given the experience of regulatory failures, often due to the capture of regulation by private interests. Instant communication favors opinion-formers claiming authority, while representative democracy has shifted to “audience representation,” opening the way for demagogue leaders, as well as clientelism and corruption. While the financial crisis opened up possibilities for a paradigm shift in international tax governance, the tensions in both the technocratic and political spheres, as well as the growing gap between them, make it hard to achieve a stable and effective outcome. © 2020 The Author.

Traditionally, the literature on social policies argues that in the presence of socioeconomic transformations and pressures from women's movements and from left or center-left governments, the adoption of care policies is more likely to happen. Yet, Costa Rica adopted its care policy during a fiscal crisis, with a lack of demands for care policies from the women's movement, and with a right-wing party in government. Drawing data from documents and semistructured interviews, this article demonstrates the applicability of the multiple streams approach to understand care policy-making processes in developing countries. The study finds that the multiple streams approach effectively explains the adoption of the policy as the product of top-down decisions from the national women's agency that constructs the problem, a close-knit policy design led by technocrats and bureaucrats, and the politicization of care policies to gain electoral support. © 2022 Policy Studies Organization.","care policies; multiple-streams approach; public policy processes",,,,,,,"Alcantara, M., Rivas, C., The Left–Right Dimension in Latin America Party Politics (2006) Proceedings from the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association; Araya, A.A., (2011) Opositores coinciden con opinion critica de ciudadanos, , https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/opositores-coinciden-con-opinion-critica-de-ciudadanos/LLGD5PLAGNAIZBURMHEN2KHVPU/story/, La Nacion; Arguedas Ramirez, G., El (aún) tortuoso camino hacia la emancipación: fundamentalismos religiosos, los derechos humanos de grupos históricamente oprimidos y la lucha por un Estado Laico en Costa Rica (2011) Anuario Centro de Investigación y Estudios Políticos, 1, pp. 50-65; Arza, C., Martinez-Franzoni, J., A long decade of gendering social policy in Latin America: Transformative steps and inequality traps (2018) Handbook on gender and social policy, pp. 408-429. , S.

Politicians and bureaucrats create pockets or networks of effectiveness that allow some departments to perform more efficiently than others. How do these networks develop and how are politicized bureaucratic appointments used to influence performance? Drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in Punjab, Pakistan, this paper argues that politicians and bureaucrats ensure enhanced performance by making legal and extra-legal appointments of hand-picked bureaucrats to key posts. The choice of bureaucrat is made on the basis of carefully curated relationships of patronage established through work, training, and old school networks. As a result, temporary networks of effectiveness are created but rendered unsustainable by the very patronage relationships that create them, preventing them from evolving into more permanent pockets of effectiveness. More broadly, my argument contributes to debates on intra-state capacity and politicization, establishing a link between patterns of staffing and patterns of governance. © 2021, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).","Bureaucratic performance; Pakistan; Patronage; Pockets of effectiveness; South Asia; State capacity","bureaucracy; fieldwork; governance approach; nation state; qualitative analysis; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]",,,,,,"Abdulaimohan, A.-G.G., (2019) The Politics of Bureaucratic ‘pockets of effectiveness’: Insights from Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, , www.effective-states.org, Pockets of Effectiveness Working Paper No. 3.

This study draws on a survey from 13 cities to explore behavioral variations in the two categories of civil servants. Two test methods (the OLS and mediation model) are adopted to verify the findings. This study finds that both the vertical and horizontal responsiveness of civil servants who are SSGs tend to be higher than those recruited from the REEs in facing the above-mentioned conflict. Four personnel mechanisms are tested to explain this variation: (1) the politicized recruitment and selection of SSGs, (2) job arrangements for SSGs, (3) triple leadership over SSGs, and (4) a fast-track stream for SSGs. Our analysis reveals that only the first two can account for this variation. This account can shed new light on the impact of the development of a separate corps of elites in China. © 2022 Issues & Studies.","Civil servants at the grassroots level; politicization; responsiveness; specially selected graduates",,,,,,,"http://www.huatu.com/2017/1121/1607109.html, 2018 nian guokao baoming jieshu, zuigao baolubi 2318:1 [2018 2318:1, The 2018 national exam registration is over, the highest registration ratio is 2318:1].

Key is an appointed position with greater budgetary authority attached being more important. Yet, position importance has been measured broadly—for example, distinguishing among appointment tiers—without incorporating discretionary budgets as a more nuanced measure. We rectify this, assessing hypotheses about how a position's discretionary budget impacts the president's nomination choice and the Senate's responses. As expected, higher budgets are associated with presidents nominating those with whom they are more in tune ideologically, but this effect is mitigated for top-tier appointments. Also as predicted, the Senate moves these high budget appointments through the process more smoothly with higher approval likelihoods. Budgets are a key element of position importance for department-level agencies, structuring how presidents choose and the Senate reacts in politicizing the bureaucracy. © 2022 Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress","agency budgets; political appointments; separation of powers bargaining",,,,,,,"Baker, P., 2014. “Obama's Odds with Congress Bad to Worse.” New York Times, June 13, A4; Bertelli, A.M., Grose, C.R., The Lengthened Shadow of Another Institution?

Against the grain of existing studies I argue, through a case-study of interwar Romania, that welfare states are constructed to proactively (re)build the nation, rather than retroactively emanate from it, once established. Rather than an ahistorical ethnolinguistic fractionalization, the article takes nationhood as historically fluid and contested because through institutionalized action, elites can and do proactively revamp the political arena, redistributing coalitions of winners and losers based on exogenously given criteria. The article therefore shows that nation forgers typically internalize the global social question through the topoi of local socio-economic problems construed as a national question. Because elites can pick and choose who becomes part of the national compact, the politicization of the perception of incomplete nationhood provides a sufficient ideational thrust for welfare policymaking, irrespective of pre-existing national solidarities. Consequently, welfare policies are typically layered as remedial or compensatory policies designed to foster a specific social mobility, deemed in a top-down fashion to be completing the nation. © The Author(s) 2021.","ethnic diversity and welfare states; interwar Romanian welfare policies; late industrializing states; modernization; nationalism; social policy; welfare state development; welfare state, nation-building","bureaucracy; ethnicity; modernization; nationalism; social policy; state building; welfare impact; welfare provision; Romania",,,,,"Central European University, CEU","Achterberg, D., Houtman, D., de Koster, W., ‘Some are more equal than others’: economic egalitarianism and welfare chauvinism in the Netherlands’ (2010) Journal of European Public Policy, 20 (4), pp. 350-363; Alesina, A., Glaeser, E.L., (2004) Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe: A World of Difference, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London, Verso; Baldwin, K., Huber, J.D., Economic versus cultural difference: forms of ethnic diversity and public goods provision (2010) American Political Science Review, 104, pp. 644-662; Banerjee, A., Iyer, L., Somanathan, R., History, social divisions, and public goods in rural India (2005) Journal of the European Economic Association, 3 (2-3), pp. 639-647; Batou, J., Economic nationalism and globalization: the long 19th century (2006) History and Culture of Economic Nationalism in East Central Europe, , H Schultz, E Kubu, (eds), Berlin, Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag GmbH, In:, (eds; Béland, D., Lecours, A., (2008) Nationalism and Social Policy: The Politics of Territorial Solidarity, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Béland, D., Lecours, A., Federalism, policy change, and social security in Belgium: explaining the decentralization of family allowances in the sixth state reform (2018) Journal of European Social Policy, 28 (1), pp. 55-69; Béland, D., Kpessa, M., Lecours, A., Nationalism, development, and social policy: the politics of nation-building in Sub-Saharan Africa (2011) Ethnic and Racial Studies, 34 (12), pp. 2115-2133; Bottoni, S., National projects, regional identities, everyday compromises.

Several studies have shown that domestic pressure has made the EU's ‘electorally connected’ institutions more responsive. Yet, we still know little about how politicisation has affected the Union's non-majoritarian institutions. We address this question by focusing on agenda-setting and ask whether and how domestic politics influences the prioritisation of legislative proposals by the European Commission. We argue that the Commission, as both a policy-seeker and a survival-driven bureaucracy, will respond to domestic issue salience and Euroscepticism, at party, mass and electoral level, through targeted performance and through aggregate restraint. Building on new data on the prioritisation of legislative proposals under the ordinary legislative procedure (1999–2019), our analysis shows that the Commission's choice to prioritise is responsive to the salience of policy issues for Europe's citizens. By contrast, our evidence suggests that governing parties’ issue salience does not drive, and Euroscepticism does not constrain, the Commission's priority-setting. Our findings contribute to the literature on multilevel politics, shedding new light on the strategic responses of non-majoritarian institutions to the domestic politicisation of ‘Europe’. © 2021 The Authors.

We show that these forms of corruption frequently do not coincide and offer an explanation: bureaucrats hired based on political and personal connections have different identities and incentives which compel them to engage in corruption for political and personal gain respectively. List experiments with a unique sample of 6400 bureaucrats in five countries in Africa and Asia support our argument. As theoretically expected, effects are strongest for bureaucrats whose political patrons remain in power (for corruption for political gain) and who do not need corruption gains to sustain their households (for corruption for personal gain). We also find that personal connections matter more than political connections for bureaucratic recruitment across surveyed countries. Our findings underscore the importance of studying varieties of bureaucratic corruption and of supplementing the politicization literature with studies of personal connections in bureaucracy. © 2022 The Authors.

This article employs a mixed methods approach by combining data from interview research with text analysis of ministerial level documents to explore reforms and rhetoric in the public security bureaucracy during the first six years of Xi’s tenure. The timing, nature, and practical execution of police reform shed light on the priorities of the Xi administration and its ability to make changes to the police bureaucracy and enforce law and order in Chinese cities. The paper assesses key policing reform rhetoric using Jean-Paul Brodeur’s framework of high and low policing to analyze which areas of policing have received the most attention and in what ways. Ultimately, I find that preferences for “high policing” style stability maintenance reforms supersede concern for “low policing” activities such as crime-fighting, resulting in the further politicization of policing in China. © 2022, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.","China; Crime; Police Reform; Policing; Stability Maintenance",,,,,,,"Fewsmith, J., Xi Jinping’s Fast Start (2013) China Leadership Monitor, 41, pp. 1-7; Li, C., Promoting ‘Young Guards’: The Recent High Turnover in the PLA Leadership (2016) China Leadership Monitor, 49, pp. 1-12; Greitens, S.C., Domestic Security in China under Xi Jinping (2019) China Leadership Monitor, 59, pp. 1-18; Scoggins, S., Rethinking Authoritarian Resilience and the Coercive Apparatus (2021) Comparative Politics, 53 (2), pp. 309-330; Trevaskes, S., Using Mao to Package Criminal Justice Discourse in 21st-Century China (2016) The China Quarterly, 226, pp. 299-318; (2015) 公安部, , http://bj.people.com.cn/n/2015/0216/c82837-23928025.html, Beijing Daily., Beijing Daily.

Following this logic, territorial administration, studied both by historiography and by theorists of classical law, was a fundamental instrument in the long ""conquest"" of the centre over its peripheries. As an organ of political power, local administration would have had the role of executor and relay between the central power and the provinces/departments, reflecting the binary nature of a pyramidal link composed of subordination and/or contestation. Thus, the modernisation of the state and the growth of the administrative bureaucracy were linked in a joint quest for efficiency and rationality. However, the administrative project of the revolutionaries of 1789, in other words their political conception of the territory, reflects an entirely different logic. Indeed, insofar as the law was envisaged by the first Constituents as the perfect translation of the general will resulting from the sovereignty of the people, its execution was theoretically based on popular consent, which could not be a constraint, even if negotiated. In short, the constitutional project of the early Revolution can be seen as an alternative to the modernising vulgate of the 19th century and as an original political thought that renews the link between sovereignty and territory through the regeneration of the territorial executive power thought as the implementation of political freedom. © 2022 Casa Velazquez.

Based on an original dataset of 512 appointments of top civil servants (TCS) in the Eastern German Länder and Berlin between January 2000 and December 2019, it is investigated (1) whether the descriptive representation of East Germans increases over time and (2) how commonalities and differences between TCS with East or West German origin develop over time. The focus here is on their educational and career background as well as on party politicisation. Findings reveal a clear temporal effect: the descriptive representation of East Germans in top positions in the civil service increases over time. Still, East Germans remain highly under-represented in Eastern Germany’s administrative elite. Another important finding is that TCS increasingly converge over time in terms of their educational and career background. A similar converging trend is observable with regard to party politicisation. These findings indicate a trend towards ‘normalisation’, i.e. an increasing adaptation to West German standards. This adaptation process, however, is taking longer than expected as the after-effects of the West German ‘elite imports’ in the early 1990s are enduring and profound. © 2022 Association for the Study of German Politics.",,,,,,,,"Bach, T., Top Officials’ Careers and the Relationship Between Politics and Administration (2020) NISPAcee Journal of Public Administration and Policy, 13 (2), pp. 35-48; Bach, T., Veit, S., The Determinants of Promotion to High Public Office in Germany: Partisan Loyalty, Political Craft, or Managerial Competencies?

The first is delegitimization: a suspicion of the public sector that has curdled into claims that public officials are deep state enemies of the people. This undermines belief in the capacity of government to deliver on democratic promises. Second is deconstruction, which includes undermining administrative capacity and delivery of services, making it harder for institutions to deliver on democratic promises, or to do so in ways that are transparent or generative of conditions in which the public sees government helping. The third is political control, in which loyalty to the political leaders is a primary virtue: this weakens structural protections of public employees and the capacities of government agencies to pursue their statutory mission or respond to other sources of democratic control such as Congress. © 2021 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.","administrative capacity; administrative state; bureaucracy; politicization; public administration; Trump",,,,,,,"Arnold, P., (1998) Making the managerial presidency: Comprehensive reorganization planning, 1905–1996, , 2nd ed., Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas; Arnsdorf, I., Clark, D.B., Berzon, A., Damon, A., (2021) Heeding Steve Bannon’s call, election deniers organize to seize control of the GOP–and reshape America’s elections, , https://www.propublica.org, Propublicia, Available from; Barry-Jester, A.M., We’re coming for you”: For public health officials, a year of threats and menace (2021) U.S. News, , https://www.usnews.com, Available from; Bauer, M.B., Peters, G., Pierre, J., Yesilkagit, K., Becker, S., (2021) Democratic backsliding and public administration: How populists in government transform state bureaucracies, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, eds; Benner, K., Barr’s approach closes the gap between the Justice Department and the White House (2020) New York Times, , 25, September; Blake, A., Trump’s government full of temps (2020) Washington Post, , 21, February; (2021) Election officials under attack: How to protect administrators and safeguard democracy, , Washington, DC, Brennan Center for Justice and Bipartisan Policy Center; Caillier, J., The priming effect of corruption and bureaucracy bashing on citizens’ perceptions of an agency’s performance (2018) Public Performance & Management Review, 41 (2). , (,): 201–23; Carpenter, D., The evolution of national bureaucracy in the United States (2005) The Executive Branch, pp. 41-71. , Aberbach Joel D., Peterson Mark A., (eds), New York, NY, Oxford University Press, eds; Chen, C.-A., Bozeman, B., Am I a public servant or am I a pathogen?

In seeking to address the presence of heterogenous welfare outcomes in the districts of India, the article underscores the salience of last-mile bureaucrats and the extent to which the politicization of redistributive struggles might contribute to local state capacity to deliver welfare services, a hitherto under-researched aspect in comparative social development research. Challenging the conventional thesis that only a strong autonomous state succeeds in implementing welfare programmes, the article further argues that effective policy implementation can occur within the peculiar environment of relatively low-capacity last-mile bureaucracies even in the face of adverse socioeconomic circumstances. In short, the article shifts attention to the understudied relationship between the capacity of last-mile bureaucracy and welfare outcomes in India. © 2021 Regional Studies Association.","federalism; India; last-mile welfare; Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act; redistributive struggles; state autonomy",,,,,,"Leverhulme Trust: IN-2013-043; National University of Singapore, NUS; Ministry of Urban Development, MoUD","Acemoglu, D., Garcia-Jimeno, C., Robinson, J.A., State capacity and economic development: A network approach (2015) American Economic Review, 105 (8), pp. 2364-2409; Aiyar, Y., Bhattacharya, S., The post office paradox: A case study of the block level education bureaucracy (2016) Economic and Political Weekly; Alesina, A., Baqir, R., Easterly, W., Public goods and ethnic divisions (1999) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114 (4), pp. 1243-1284; Andrews, M., Pritchett, L., Woolcock, M., (2012), Escaping capability traps through problem-driven iterative adaptation (PDIA), (Harvard Kennedy School Faculty Research Working Paper Series; Besley, T., Pande, R., Rao, V., Just rewards?

Commonly accepted definitions of citizenship are produced not only through explicit political discourse but also through the everyday actions of state agencies. The selection of the “worthy” migrants that those street-level bureaucracies operate is deeply rooted in interpretations of the nation's boundaries. In this article, I examine this everyday production of citizenship and nationhood by focusing on the case of Polish migration policies approached through the lens of an ethnographic study of street-level bureaucracies. While the rapid politicization of immigration in this country since 2015 resembles a major shift, an inquiry into the practices of policy implementation invites interrogations concerning continuities between past and present state practices, as well as concerning the definitions of citizens and of “worthy” immigrants that were and are prevalent within Polish institutions.

The demand for it is utterly beyond belief.”1 The assessment refects a historical moment when the practice of sensitivity training had not yet coalesced into the stuff of mandatory corporate seminars. In 1968 sensitivity training stood at the cutting edge of scientifc research, countercultural experimentation, and antiracist activism. Yet its institutional uptake in the post-civil rights era would transform the cultural signifcance of this social invention into something profoundly different. How did an emotionally intense therapeutic technology become a maligned mechanism of corporate bureaucracy? And why has it generated such a vast corpus of satirical representations on TV? This essay constructs a brief historical account of US sensitivity training and analyzes its cultural impact through its depictions in contemporary television shows. Contingent on the legal gains of feminist and antiracist activism, as well as the economic shift toward deindustrialization, the spread of sensitivity training across the later twentieth century contributed to the popular confation of the two. This convergence rendered sensitivity training an overdetermined site for adjudicating racial and gender norms alongside economic trends. In this context, the many depictions of sensitivity training on TV function as an archive of labor's disputation and politicization, recording and consolidating popular visions of workplace diversity and its managerial systems. © 2021 Johns Hopkins University Press.

However, patronage is understudied in cases when a change of minister takes place without government termination. Taking individual government ministers as the units of analysis, we identify four modalities of ministerial alterations: replacing, successive, incumbent, and switching ministers. We show that politicization occurs under “replacing ministers” following government termination, but the bureaucratic turnover is equally high under “successive ministers.” That suggests that patronage can be seen as an individualized power resource of autonomous ministers who exercise influence independently of their political parties. © The Author(s) 2020.","ministerial alterations; patronage; political appointments; political parties; top executives",,,,,,"Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR: GA 18-15700S; Vedecká Grantová Agentúra MŠVVaŠ SR a SAV, VEGA: 1/0628/19","Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and politicians in Western democracies, , Harvard University Press; Bach, T., Hammerschmid, G., Löffler, L., More delegation, more political control?

This has important consequences for the quality of public goods provision and the perceived trustworthiness of bureaucrats. We explore the effect of democratization on the discrimination of women and minorities in the civil service. We argue democratization leads to increased discrimination due to the politicization of identity cleavages. We test our argument using administrative data from Indonesia that cover the career histories of more than four million active civil servants. We exploit the exogenous timing of Indonesia's democratization and the staggered introduction of local direct elections for identification purposes. We find strong evidence that democratization worsened the career prospects of female and some religious minority bureaucrats.

Conclusions: Mental healthcare in Australia is distorted by politicisation, spin and a refusal to acknowledge the reality of the current situation. These challenges for mental healthcare demonstrate some similarities with the Ministries of Truth and Plenty, which conversely performed as their opposites in Orwell’s novel.

This article uses a micro-data set of Spanish officers to study the politicisation of the army during the Second Republic (1931-1939) taking Franco's Africanist faction as the case study. The military reforms during 1931-1933 increased the impersonality of rules determining the promotion of officers, but executive discretionary powers persisted. The results suggest that changes in the government affected the dynamics of the army. Under conservative governments (1934-1935), Africanists were promoted more rapidly. Centre-left governments during the period of 1931-1933 did not systematically promote Africanists differently, but the revision of promotions in 1933 slowed their careers. The politicisation of the army was one of the factors contributing to the military coup that started the Spanish Civil War.

Observing them at work in Paris is thus a fruitful ‘laboratory experience’ to identify the major features of the prefectoral culture—quite distinct from the classic bureaucratic culture. Our interviewees make three main self-legitimizing claims: (1) ‘We are officials with a ground-level experience’, as opposed to the ‘bureaucrats’ of the central services. (2) ‘We are representatives of the whole State and the General Interest’, meaning that they refuse to be assimilated to public servants among others, confined to the specific ministry where they temporarily work. (3) They reverse to their advantage the criticism against their politicization by claiming to be ‘the only civil servants who understand the logic of politics’. These identity assertions, which are attempts by the prefectoral corps to heighten its own stature with respect to rival groups and ministries, reveal its ambition to co-govern the State along with the political masters. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ENA; France; Prefects and sub-prefects; Professional culture; Senior civil service; Sociology of the state",,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (1988) The System of Professions. an Essay on the Division of Expert Labor, , Chicago: Chicago University Press; Almond, G., Verba, S., (1963) The Civil Culture, , London: Sage; Bezes, P., (2009) Réinventer l’Etat.

Though it was used as a synonym of partisanship by Classical Approach, the politiciza-tion of bureaucracy, by virtue of Bureaucratic Politics Approach and Principle-Agent Approach that shed light on the different aspects of the politics-bureaucracy relations, gained two new meanings by the 1980s. While first meaning underlines harmony and complementarity between politics-bureaucracy, the second points a responsive and com-petent bureaucracy. Such a case, as it indicates one single signifier for three signifieds from the point of semiotics, has prevented us to demarcate an obvious distinction between different meanings of the concept. In order to ease analyzing and comprehending, this study, which aims to present three different meanings of the politicization of bureaucracy, claims that these different meanings can be examined via three types of antonyms in lin-guistics. While first meaning is related with complimentary antonym, second and third are matched with relational antonym and graded antonym respectively. © 2021 TURKIYE ORTADOGU AMME IDARES IENSTITUSU.

I develop a theory of personnel politics in which presidents balance ideological and interest group demands in distributing human resources across the federal government. I argue administrations advantage organizations with which they are ideologically aligned and that agencies with higher levels of union penetration see increased budgeted personnel levels, particularly during Democratic presidencies. Using an original dataset of budgeted personnel levels from fiscal years (FY) 1983-2016 and a series of regression analyses, I find strong support for these hypotheses. I also examine the sensitivity of presidential strategy to congressional preferences, agency professionalization, and leadership politicization, providing insights into how this control strategy interacts with the broader environment. Overall, these results have implications for understanding the political dynamics of human capital and capacity in the federal bureaucracy, the administrative presidency, and the politics of performance in federal agencies. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This study aims to realize the attitude of state servants who must be neutral from the influence of all political groups and parties and not be discriminatory in providing services to the community. In the legal and governmental aspects, bureaucratic reform is a very strong issue to be realized. The methodology used in this research is descriptive qualitative with an effort to explain the phenomena in the field related to the Indonesian government bureaucracy which is suspected to have contributed greatly to the occurrence of various public service crisis management. The findings of this study indicate that there is a bureaucratic culture that is thick with bureaucratic politicization and the lack of transparency in public services. The mainactor public services has not prioritized fair service to the community.

The study adopted a survey research design and utilized primary data obtained through the administration of questionnaires to a purposively selected 220 respondents comprising senior bureaucrats and CSOs, and conduct of the in-depth interview. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis with the aid of SPSS. The study revealed that even though, bureaucrats are not necessarily the primary makers of the policy. They play an active role in policy implementation in Nigeria. However, factors such as political pressure, inadequate budgetary allocation, over politicization of the appointment into governmental offices leading to inadequate professionalism, and environmental variables hinder the effective implementation of policy in Nigeria. It was equally established that as ideal as the Weberian model of bureaucracy is, there are inevitable lacuna and inadequacies in its application to Nigeria, due to factors such as socio-cultural forces, collectivism as against individualism, and absolute formalism. The study concluded that, although Weberian bureaucracy could be ideal and applicable to large-scale economy, its model is inadequate in addressing all the needs and circumstances of Nigeria. Hence, the need to restructure or readjust the bureaucracy to adapt to new and complex problems becomes apparent. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","administration; Bureaucracy; Democracy; good governance; policy",,,,,,,"Adamolekun, L., Africa’s evolving career civil service systems: Three challenges state continuity, efficient service delivery and accountability (2002) International Review of Administrative Science, 68 (3), p. 007226. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0020852302683005; Adebayo, M., (2011), No Fear: A Whistleblowers Triumph Over Corruption and Retaliation at the EPA.

This paper clarifies the presidential particularism literature by explicitly considering the mechanism through which the president pursues their policy goals: Executive agencies. The constellation of bureaucratic agencies responsible for allocating grants plays a key role in facilitating or frustrating presidential policy priorities. Using a dataset of 21 agencies over 14 years, I find that only agencies ideologically proximate to the president engage in particularism benefiting the president. I find no evidence that politicization influences agency implementation of particularism. Critically, the moderating effect of the bureaucracy on particularism only occurs for distributive programs over which agencies have discretion. When disbursing formula grants written by Congress but administered by the bureaucracy with little or no discretion, ideological distance between agencies and presidents has no effect on particularism. © 2021 The Author(s).

By studying the re-internationalisation of the Yen, our research found that the dynamic interactive mechanism between policy actors has a profound impact on the overall course of domestic currency internationalisation. In the case study, along with the establishment of the “Prime Minister-controlled” model, the “bureaucrat-controlled” policy process of Yen re-internationalisation led by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) experienced substantial intervention by the Prime Minister and related influences. The case study shows that Koizumi exerted pressure on the MOF and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) via budgeting power and the flexible use of resources. Moreover, the MOF and the BOJ relied on accumulated professional financial experience and the resources of legally binding independence in financial policy to successfully safeguard organisational interests and core policy concepts. Our research shows that resource exchange between the three entities helped the Prime Minister to minimise policy confrontation effectively while objectively promoting the interdependence of fiscal, monetary and financial policies, which drove sharp change in the Yen re-internationalisation policy and its long-term outlook. This case study of Japan suggests ongoing concern about the increasing politicisation of the distinctly professionalised currency internationalisation policy. © 2020 Asian Studies Association of Australia.","core executive; currency internationalisation; dynamic interactive mechanism; Japan; Prime Minister-controlled policy process; resource exchange; Yenre-internationalisation",,,,,,"2017EGJ002; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS: 17YJCZH117, 19CGJ045","Adolino, J.R., Blake, C.H., (2010) Comparing public policies: Issues and choices in six industrialized countries, , CQ Press; Keizai, A., Kinyū no Shōmondai ni Kansuru Senmon Bukai.

The enquiry yielded the following findings: Functional politicisation of ministerial middle and lower management as well as rank-and-file positions is predominantly low. However, politically motivated appointments and promotions, executed through formal politicisation, pertain to ministerial high management positions. Overall, the enquiry suggests that Czech ministries are moderately politicised, showing a somewhat lesser degree of direct political influence than generally suspected. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bureaucracy; Central Europe; Czech Republic; ministry; Politicisation; quantitative enquiry",,,,,,"Univerzita Karlova v Praze, UK","Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., (2000) In the Web of Politics: Three Decades of the U.S. Federal Executive, , Washington, DC: Brookings Institution; Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., The Past and Future of Political-Administrative Relations: Research From Bureaucrats and Politicians to In the Web of Politics–and Beyond (2006) International Journal of Public Administration, 29 (12), pp. 977-995; Ágh, A., Public Administration in Central and Eastern Europe (2003) Handbook of Public Administration, pp. 536-548. , Peters B.G., Pierre J., (eds), London: Sage,. edited by; Ágh, A., Politics and Policy in East-Central Europe in the Early 21st Century (2009) The NISPAcee Journal of Public Administration and Policy, 2 (1), pp. 25-39; Bach, T., Hammerschmid, G., Löffler, L., More Delegation, More Political Control?

These gave the Commission a certain degree of discretion in applying the rules and interpreting the benchmarks of the post-crisis EU economic governance arrangements. This article investigates if this double shift in fiscal policy and governance that was initiated in 2014 has been consolidated in 2019, and, if so, what has driven that consolidation. By building on the literatures on EU politicization and policy learning, it asks whether the character of this intra-paradigm policy shift has been more Bayesian or sociological. Based on interviews and on a small-scale survey conducted with key civil servants working at the European Commission, we find evidence to support the putative explanation that, through a political process of policy learning, European Semester officials have acquired a more politicized and flexible practice of fiscal governance and a more social vision of the European Semester. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Austerity; euro crisis; European Commission; European Semester; policy learning; policy paradigms",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU","Ban, C., Austerity versus stimulus?

To date, however, differences across administrative traditions have received little empirical scrutiny; research tends to be more comparable than comparative. Using data from an expert survey systematically measuring the merit-, political-, and personal-recruitment of senior public servants in 20 countries, this article examines differences across and within the Nordic, Westminster, Germanic and Napoleonic administrative traditions, in addition to the alternative Anglo-American and Southern European traditions. Various tests show meaningful variation in politicization across administrative traditions, with the starkest differences found between the Nordic and Napoleonic traditions. The results also show less variation among the countries comprising the Nordic tradition than that found within the other traditions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Administrative tradition; bureaucracy; comparative public administration; patronage; politicization; quality of government",,,,,,,"Allern, E.H., Appointments to public administration in Norway: No room for political parties (2012) Party patronage and party government in European democracies, pp. 272-293. , Kopecký P., Mair P., Spirova M., (eds), Oxford University Press,.

To shed light on these questions, we here explore increasing political polarization (and fragmentation) in Dutch politics and functional politicization over the period 2007-2019 to see how the two are related. To do so, we adopt a cross-time approach that observes which skills - political-strategic insight, substantive expertise (Fachwissen), or procedural knowledge (Dienstwissen) - senior civil servants perceive to be the most relevant to successfully and correctly exercise their profession in a period of increasing polarization in the Dutch political landscape. Drawing from surveys conducted with senior civil servants in 2007, 2013 and 2019, combined with semi-structured interviews conducted in 2019, the data depicts the prevalence of political astuteness in the profession and highlights the factors for its causes: institutional, organizational, and interpersonal dynamics. This indicates an (in)direct link between political polarization and functional politicization of the administrative apparatus that serves as a basis for further cross-time and cross-country investigation. © 2020 Alexandre Belloir, Caspar van den Berg, published by Sciendo.","Bureaucratic powers; Functional politicization; Polarization; Political-administrative dichotomy; Senior civil servants",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats & Politicians in Western Democracies, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; (2016) Visie Op Publiek Leiderschap, , https://www.algemenebestuursdienst.nl/documenten/publicatie/2016/06/30/visieop-publiek-leiderschap, last accessed 13 April 2020; Aucoin, P., New political governance in Westminster systems: Impartial public administration and management performance at risk (2012) Governance: An International Journal of Policy, Administration, and Institutions, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Bakker, R., Hooghe, L., Jolly, S., Marks, G., Polk, J., Rovny, J., Steenbergen, M., Vachudova, M.A., (2019) Chapel Hill Expert Survey.

To that end, we compare the career backgrounds of top civil servants before and after the entry into force of the new Civil Service Act. The article examines the career backgrounds of the persons appointed as ministerial deputies between 2013 and 2018, focusing on their last “pre-deputy” jobs and considering a broader set of their career attributes. A focus on the previous job reveals that even before the law was introduced, bureaucrats constituted the largest share of appointees, and their share even increased with the new legislation. The incidence of deputies appointed directly from party-related jobs dropped considerably. However, when a broader set of career attributes is considered, the share of partisans among the pre-2015 deputies nearly matches that of the career bureaucrats. Ostensibly political careers among the post-2015 deputies declined but remain significant. Hence, there has been a decline in the open politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy after 2015. Party political effects also matter, as the new ANO party, after entering the executive, has taken a different approach to top bureaucratic appointments than the other major governing Czech parties. Typically, deputies appointed into the positions under the ANO's control would not have links to the party itself but would be recruited via non-party channels, e.g. from pre-political networks of the ANO ministers and leaders. Consequently, though less politicized by party agents, the current Czech system is more a product of choices made by government ministers of the day than a stable arrangement resulting from firmly established norms and rules. © 2020 Marek Rybář, Milan Podmaník, published by Sciendo.","Careers; Civil service; Czech Republic; Executives; Politicization; Top civil servants",,,,,,"Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR: GA 18-15700S","Bach, T., Hammerschmid, G., Löffler, L., More delegation, more political control?

It also includes suggestions on how to move forward in terms of research methods and how the systematic analysis of administrative careers can strengthen the comparative analysis of the relationship between politics and administration. © 2020 Tobias Bach, published by Sciendo.","Administrative careers; Patronage; Performance; Politicization; Senior civil servants; Turnover",,,,,,,"Adolph, C., (2013) Bankers, Bureaucrats, and Central Bank Politics: The Myth of Neutrality, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Askim, J., Karlsen, R., Kolltveit, K., Political appointees in executive government: Exploring and explaining roles using a large-n survey in Norway (2017) Public Administration, 95 (2), pp. 342-358; Aucoin, P., New political governance in Westminster systems: Impartial public administration and management performance at risk (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Avellaneda, C.N., Municipal performance: Does mayoral quality matter?

To explain this finding, we assumed that sharing economy benefits are enjoyed by the public, whereas its costs are chiefly borne by market incumbents. In considering these competing interests, policymakers tend to favor the latter as single-industry interests that can be more easily organized to influence policymaking. We then hypothesized that an electorally competitive, depoliticized, and effective government may tilt the balance against the entrenched market incumbents, leading to the growth of sharing economy industries. Overall, we found some support for this hypothesis. We especially found that electoral competitiveness strongly impacted sharing economy development and that this impact was significantly greater in a country with a depoliticized bureaucracy and effective government. © 2020 by the authors.

This benign narrative generates a significant hypothesis, which is that the institutionalization of the partisan role diminishes the risk of civil service politicization. That hypothesis has yet to be fully tested. Several studies have assessed the impact of advisers' actions on civil service impartiality, but the consequences of bureaucrats' own agency for that dependent variable have received far less attention. Drawing on data from a survey of New Zealand public servants, this article challenges the assumption in the political advisers literature that civil service politicization is primarily driven by exogenous factors and calls for a more nuanced theoretical approach to endogenous aspects of politicization. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"civil service; parliament; party politics; public administration; public sector; service provision; New Zealand",,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and politicians in Western democracies, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., Civil servants and policy makers: Neutral or responsive competence?

A literature review and documental analysis were carried out, and an on-line questionnaire was applied to Senior Civil Servants in managerial positions in Portugal between 2004 and 2011 (n = 964). The results show that, in all cases, the p-value was equal or less than.05 (p ≤.05). The analysis allowed us to confirm two main criteria used for the selection of Senior Civil Servants (political and professional) and their respective factors. Despite indicating that the political criterion somehow plays a role in the selection of public officials in Portugal, the study could not confirm the hypothesis that political factors are predominant when hiring senior civil servants in the country. © 2020, Fundacao Getulio Vargas.

A recent body of research, however, has begun to question the death of the Westminster administrative tradition. This article contributes to this debate by focusing on an important tenet of this tradition: the permanency of civil servants. Using original longitudinal data of administrative heads in the UK between 1949 and 2014, this article investigates whether the relationship between several political events within the executive government and turnover of permanent secretaries has strengthened since 1979. The empirical results from cross-tabulation analysis and logistic regression suggest that over the last 60 years the relationship between political events in the executive and administrative turnover has largely remained unchanged. Since 1979, a change in the governing party, a change in the prime minister, and the re-election of a prime minister, do not lead to a greater increase in permanent secretary turnover. With the permanency of elite bureaucrats still intact, the evidence supports research suggesting that reforms since 1979 better reflect a pattern of institutional layering on top of the Westminster administrative tradition, rather than constituting its demise. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Administrative tradition; Bureaucracy; Institutional reform; Permanent secretaries; Politicization; Westminster",,,,,,,"Aucoin, P., New political governance in westminster systems: Impartial public administration and management performance at risk (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Barberis, P., (1996) The elite of the elite: Permanent secretaries in the British higher civil service, , Dartmouth Publishing Company, Aldershot; Bennister, M., (2012) Prime ministers in power political leadership in Britain and Australia, , Palgrave Macmillan, New York; Bertelli, A.M., Lewis, D.E., Policy influence, agency-specific expertise, and exit in the federal service (2013) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 23 (2), pp. 223-245; Bourgault, J., Dion, S., Governments come and go, but what of civil servants?

Based on the different loyalties and roles of political advisors (PA) and civil servants (CS), we hypothesise that (1) PAs are more likely to voice internally, (2) CSs are more likely to voice externally and (3) CSs in functionally politicised systems are more likely to stay silent. These hypotheses are tested on - and partially supported by - data collected through two surveys directed to the ministerial staffs in Denmark and Sweden. PAs are more likely to voice internally, but none of the two groups is particularly keen to voice externally.

The Turkish government responded by opening legal cases, jailing academics, and dismissing them from universities. In the state of emergency following the July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, the government's extended powers allowed them to fire thousands of civil servants from every branch of government, including thousands of academics. This increased the number of academics who organized to form and teach in academic collectives. The current study evaluates how politicization occurs in scholars removed from the university environment. Traditional approaches to collective action and politicization suggest that empowerment is an important catalyst in politicization and continuation of collective political engagement. With the social and political restrictions that decree law dismissals place on scholars, what is it that motivates them to politicize? The current study was conducted through semistructured interviews with nine academics who work in these collectives. Participants described their politicization in terms of previous practice, reaction to injustice, and ideals of academia and academic freedom. They further evaluated current and prospective functions and possible barriers to academic collectives. Finally, although somewhat ambivalent, participants discussed feelings of efficacy, psychosocial support, and senses of solidarity and liberation in terms of being empowered. Their perspectives provide an opportunity to understand how and where academics engage in scholar activism for an independent and free academia in the context of consolidated political oppression. © 2020 The Authors.

First, it shows the crucial, yet unobtrusive, role played by feminist actors in the process, in spite of the absence of any strong open politicization of the issue, from agenda setting to implementation. Second, the article points to the dual character of the reform. On the one hand, the gradual character and limited perimeter of the quota (to senior executive “initial appointments”) restricted its immediate quantitative impact. On the other hand, the constraining, technical dimension of the tool endowed it with a potential to foster incremental social change. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Bureaucratic elite; Gender quotas; Public administration; State feminism",,,,,,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR: ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02, ANR-11-LABX-0091","Acker, J., From glass ceilings to inequality regimes (2009) Sociologie du Travail, 51 (2), pp. 199-217; Albenga, V.A., Jacquemartbereni, L., Appropriations ordinaires des idées féministes (Special issue) (2015) Politix, p. 109; Banaszak, L.A., (2010) The Women’s Movement Inside and Outside the State, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bender, A.-F., Berrebi-Hoffmann, I., Reigné, P., Les quotas de femmes dans les conseils d’administration (2015) Travail, genre et sociétés, 34, pp. 169-173; Bereni, L., French Feminists Renegotiate Republican Universalism.

Although the majority of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance and civil servants in many areas have not received salaries since 2016, many healthcare providers continue to work, and families continue to need and seek care. Methods: This case study examines how reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH+N) services have been delivered since 2015, and identifies factors influencing implementation of these services in three governorates of Yemen. Content analysis methods were used to analyze publicly available documents and datasets published since 2000 as well as 94 semi-structured individual and group interviews conducted with government officials, humanitarian agency staff and facility-based healthcare providers and six focus group discussions conducted with community health midwives and volunteers in September-October 2018. Results: Humanitarian response efforts focus on maintaining basic services at functioning facilities, and deploying mobile clinics, outreach teams and community health volunteer networks to address urgent needs where access is possible. Attention to specific aspects of RMNCAH+N varies slightly by location, with differences driven by priorities of government authorities, levels of violence, humanitarian access and availability of qualified human resources. Health services for women and children are generally considered to be a priority; however, cholera control and treatment of acute malnutrition are given precedence over other services along the continuum of care. Although health workers display notable resilience working in difficult conditions, challenges resulting from insecurity, limited functionality of health facilities, and challenges in importation and distribution of supplies limit the availability and quality of services. Conclusions: Challenges to providing quality RMNCAH+N services in Yemen are formidable, given the nature and scale of humanitarian needs, lack of access due to insecurity, politicization of aid, weak health system capacity, costs of care seeking, and an ongoing cholera epidemic. Greater attention to availability, quality and coordination of RMNCAH services, coupled with investments in health workforce development and supply management are needed to maintain access to life-saving services and mitigate longer term impacts on maternal and child health and development. Lessons learned from Yemen on how to address ongoing primary health care needs during massive epidemics in conflict settings, particularly for women and children, will be important to support other countries faced with similar crises in the future. © 2020 The Author(s).","Child; Conflict; Health services; Health system; Humanitarian; Maternal; Newborn; Reproductive health; War; Yemen",,,,,,"University Research Council, Aga Khan University, URC; Hospital for Sick Children, SickKids: 129570","(2018) Geneva: United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, , http://www.unocha.org/where-we-work/current-emergencies, OCHA.

While the Sammelan’s library functioned as a public-facing, community-serving space that housed and issued printed books, periodicals and newspapers in its reading room, the archive was imagined as an accumulation of all materials, print and manuscript, relating to Hindi, with access limited to critics and scholars. The article argues that infrastructure like the library and the archive critically contributed to the process of consolidation and legitimisation of the discourse on Hindi nationalism. It also traces the post-Independence assimilation of this library to the machinery of state bureaucracy, specifically to the institution of the Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sahitya Sammelan Act, 1956, and the central government’s Hindi Sahitya Sammelan Act, 1962, which declared the Sammelan ‘an institution of national importance’. How do these acts reflect tensions between the politicisation of Hindi as the national language and democratisation in post-colonial India? Here, the article shows that Hindi was not only being monetarily patronised in the 1950s and 1960s, but was also vigilantly monitored, drawing staunch resistance from the Sammelan, which saw itself as a moral alternative to the state. It traces the history of these legislative processes which ultimately resulted in a petition against the 1962 Act in the Supreme Court in 1973, which declared it invalid. © 2020, © 2020 South Asian Studies Association of Australia.","Hindi archive; Hindi library; Hindi Sahitya Sammelan; institution of national importance","historical perspective; institutional framework; language; legislation; literature review; nationalism; post-independence",,,,,,,,,"Routledge",,,,,00856401,,,,"English","South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084852105

The intention is to demonstrate patterns of political appointments that reflect institutional performance. The data were provided by Munic/IBGE 2005/14 and IpoC-Instituições Políticas Comparadas/UFRGS. Firstly, the study observed the degree of variability of the distribution of these positions in municipal structures, and the quality of the appointees’ education. Then, an analysis of spatial, global, and local dependence was performed. In addition, the difference in performance among municipalities was statistically tested using the independent t-test. The test compared municipalities’ performance concerning the number and education of appointees. The study used the Municipal GDP-Per-Capita, the Índice Firjan de Desenvolvimento Municipal (IFDM), and the Índice de Governança Municipal (IGM) created by the Federal Board of Administration as proxies for performance. The results stress the complexity of local public management since some of the tests indicate the number and education of appointees as predictors of high performance while other studies do not find the same relationship. © 2020, Fundacao Getulio Vargas.

Yet they have overlooked how the type of public administration—and the type of administrators—is associated with innovative attitudes. Using two large, unique comparative data sets on public bureaucracies and public managers, this article examines how bureaucratic politicization and legalistic features are associated with senior public managers’ attitudes toward innovation in 19 European countries. Results of multilevel analysis indicate that the bureaucratic politicization of an administration and the law background of public managers matter. Public managers working in politicized administrations and those whose education includes a law degree exhibit lower pro-innovation attitudes (i.e., receptiveness to new ideas and creative solutions and change orientation). © 2020 The Authors.

We present situations that have induced teachers and social workers to become politically active and examine what their struggle might imply for these unaccompanied children. We also ask how the nation state is interpellated and transformed. Drawing on Laclau, Mouffe and Biesta, we find that political subjectivity emerges in situations with conflicting norms and contradictory interpellations. When Sweden deported unaccompanied refugee children, numerous social workers and teachers found themselves torn between acting as loyal civil servants or acting in accordance with their professional ethics. When representatives from this category emerge as political subjects directed at political change, the nation state becomes unstable and porous, creating possibilities for change. © The Author(s) 2019.","civil servants; critical education; gender studies; political subjectivity; social workers; teachers; unaccompanied newly arrived refugee children",,,,,,"Vetenskapsrådet, VR: VR 2009-6173, VR 2014-1418","Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London, Verso; Balibar, E., The nation form: History and ideology (1990) Review (Fernand Braudel Center), 13 (3), pp. 329-361; Biesta, G., (2011) Learning Democracy in School and Society: Education, Lifelong Learning, and the Politics of Citizenship, , Rotterdam, Sense Publishers; Billig, M., (1995) Banal Nationalism, , London, SAGE; Bolling, A., Löfven: ‘Mitt Europa bygger inte murar’ (2015) Dagens Nyheter, , https://www.dn.se/sthlm/lofven-mitt-europa-bygger-inte-murar/, 9, June, accessed 6 December 2018, Available (,) at; Braun, K., Decolonial perspectives on charitable spaces of ‘welcome culture’ in Germany (2017) Social Inclusion, 5 (3), pp. 38-48; Brinck-Larsen, M., Uppsägningsbrev, 7 February [Letter of resignation] (2017) Göteborgs-posten, , unpublished but cited 15 February; Dahlstedt, M., Lalander, P., (2018) Manifest: För ett Socialt Arbete i Tiden, , Malmö, Studentlitteratur, [Manifest for Social Work]; Dean, A.B., Teachers on the offensive: A strategy for transforming the educational reform debate (2013) New Labor Forum, 22 (3), pp. 38-45; (2018) Asylum Statistics, , https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics, accessed 24 November 2018, Available (,) at; (2017) Kartläggning av de ungdomar som Fältgruppen City möter i sitt uppsökande arbete (A mapping of youth in social outreach work), , Göteborgs Stad, Social resursförvaltning, [,]; (2016) Det är en enorm stress [It is an enormous stress], , 12, December, 6–7, (, a; (2016) We obey orders and send children to warVi lyder order och skickar barn till krig, p. 4. , 16, December, (, b), [,]; Haarstad, Å., Collective political subjectivity and the problem of scale (2007) Contemporary Politics, 13 (1), pp. 57-74; Hörnqvist, M., De los Reyes, P., (2016) Bortom Kravallerna (Beyond the Riots), , Stockholm, Stockholmia, [,]; Jones, H., Gunaratnam, Y., (2017) Go Home: The Politics of Immigration Controversies, , Manchester, Manchester University Press; Jönsson, J.H., Heggem Kojan, B., Social justice beyond neoliberal welfare nationalism: Challenges of increasing immigration to Sweden and Norway (2017) Critical and Radical Social Work, 5 (3), pp. 301-317; Kawari, F., (2018) Jag stannar till slutet, , Stockholm, Nordstedts, [I will remain until the end]; Krause, K., Schramm, K., Thinking through political subjectivity (2011) African Diaspora, 4 (2), p. 115; Laclau, E., Mouffe, C., (1985) Hegemony & Socialist Strategy, , London, Verso; Lipsky, M., (2010) Street-Level Bureaucracy: Dilemmas of the Individual in Public Services, , New York, Russell Sage Foundation; (2011) Curriculum for the Compulsory school, Preschool Class and the Recreation Centre 2011, , Stockholm, Skolverket, 2011; Malsbary, C.B., The refusal: Teachers making policy in NYC (2016) International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, 29 (10), pp. 1326-1338; Marcus, G.E., Ethnography in/of the world system: The emergence of multi-sited ethnography (1995) Annual Review of Anthropology, 24, pp. 95-117; Martinsson, L., Griffin, G., Giritli-Nygren, K., (2016) Challenging the Myth of Gender Equality in Sweden, , Bristol, Policy Press; Mouffe, C., (2013) Chantal Mouffe: Hegemony, Radical Democracy, and the Political, , Abingdon, UK, Routledge; Mouffe, C., (2018) For a Left Populism, , London, Verso; Neuhold, C., Vanhoonacker, S., Verhey, L., (2013) Civil Servants and Politics: A Delicate Balance, , New York, Palgrave Macmillan; Nordling, V., (2017) Destabilising Citizenship Practices?

By analysing the fatwas and official statements issued by Russian Muslim leaders between March and May 2020, I identify their discursive strategy of ‘interpret-ing’ the language of bureaucracy and medical terminology into the language of Islam, and of providing theological justification for certain governmental decisions. I consider several cases which illustrate the intervention of political and medical discourses of corporality into religious discourse. These include the politicisation of the regulatory functioning of the body, the sacralisation of quarantine as a special time for spiritual activities, the formatting of funer-ary ritual according to medico-administrative regulations and the comparing of victory in the Great Patriotic War to the victory over COVID-19. © The Author(s).","Biopolitics; Bureaucracy; COVID-19; Discourse analysis; Islam; Muslim studies; Russia",,,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ: 19-39-60010","Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , [1983] (Lon-don: Verso); Asad, T., (2018) Secular Translations: Nation-State, Modern Self, and Calculative Reason, , (New York: Columbia University Press); Aslan, R.

In this issue area, morality claims intersect with the material interests of home- and landowners and the security demands of ‘ordinary’ citizens. The Prostitution Law of 2001 has liberalized the legal framework: the legislation ‘normalized’ sex work, triggering the re-definition of urban strategies to regulate prostitution. This article analyses the conflict dynamics and the framing of conflicts over regulations in four German cities. It identifies the main actors, coalition-building processes and the framing of conflicts, and links these elements to the resulting policies. With regard to theory, it explores the relevance of classical explanatory approaches to local governance such as party politics, urban growth coalitions, political culture and bureaucratic politics to the value-laden issue of prostitution. It thereby contributes to the growing academic interest in the nature of morality policies and the question of the specific conditions under which prostitution is framed as a moral issue or as a ‘normal’ subject within urban politics. © The Author(s) 2019.","Frame analysis; morality policy; prostitution; regulation; urban policy","bureaucracy; governance approach; legislation; morality; planning process; prostitution; regulatory framework; urban politics; Germany",,,,,,"Aalbers, M.A., Sabat, M., Remaking a landscape of prostitution: The Amsterdam red light district (2012) City, 16 (1-2), pp. 112-128; Atkinson, R., Discourses of partnership and empowerment in contemporary British urban regeneration (1999) Urban Studies, 36 (1), pp. 59-72; Barbehön, M., Münch, S., The ‘distinctiveness of cities’ and distinctions in cities: Boundaries of belonging in comparative perspective (2015) Urban Research & Practice, 9 (1), pp. 37-55; Law on the regulation of prostitution-businesses and the protection of persons engaged in prostitution (2016) Bundesgesetzblatt, 50, pp. 2372-2383. , [,]; Crowhurst, I., Outshoorn, J., Skilbrei, M.-L., Introduction: Prostitution policies in Europe (2012) Sexuality Research and Social Policy, 9 (3), pp. 187-191; Davies, J.S., Imbroscio, D.L., (2009) Theories of Urban Politics, , Los Angeles, CA, SAGE; Di Nicola, A., Orfano, I., Cauduro, A., Conci, N., (2005) Study on National Legislation on Prostitution and the Trafficking in Women and Children, , Trento, Università degli Studi di Trento; Ditmore, M.H., Levy, A., Willman, A., (2010) Sex Work Matters: Exploring Money, Power, and Intimacy in the Sex Industry, , London and New York, Palgrave Macmillan; Dölemeyer, A., Pates, R., Schmidt, D., Deviant girls, small-scale entrepreneurs, and the regulation of German sex workers (2010) Sex Work Matters: Exploring Money, Power, and Intimacy in the Sex Industry, pp. 184-202. , Ditmore M.H., Levy A., Willman, (eds), London and New York, Palgrave Macmillan, In:, (eds; El-Cherkeh, T., Stirbu, E., Lazaroiu, S., Dragos, R., (2004) EU-enlargement, migration and trafficking in women: The case of South Eastern Europe, , Hamburg, Hamburg Institute of International Economics, HWWA-Report No. 247; Engeli, I., Green-Pedersen, P.C., Thorup Larsen, L.T., (2012) Morality Politics in Western Europe: Parties, Agendas and Policy Choices, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Euchner, E.-M., Knill, C., Prostitution: Sin, unavoidable evil or recognized profession?

Culture is seen by the country’s leadership as an important component of its state political and ideological doctrine. There is analyzed the role of the Islamic factor and cultural heritage in the cultural policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran over four decades of its existence. In this context, particular attention is paid to the role of the theory of the dialogue of civilizations proposed by M. Khatami as well as to the changing attitude towards it in the public consciousness of Iranian society, depending on the situation that is developing both inside Iran and around it in the international arena. It is emphasized that the theme of “Iran and the West”, which has a long tradition in the cultural discourse and attracts the attention of both government officials and the general public, is becoming particularly acute in the country today, contributing to its politicization. An attempt is being made to show that Iranian culture is increasingly becoming an important factor in the foreign policy activities of the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran, contributing to the strengthening of the country’s position in the world arena as a whole and the country’s leading role in the region, the realization of the idea of exporting the Islamic Revolution and implementing Iranian cultural expansion outside the country. © 2020 Authors.

The author argues that the policy-making processes of Whitehall and Westminster governance are being radically overhauled. In many Anglophone countries, ministers have sought to reduce their structural dependence on the permanent civil service. In so doing, ministers sought to gain political control over the machinery of policy-making. These efforts to restructure the permanent bureaucracy have had unintended consequences, however. The policy process in the UK state has become more fragmented, as policy-making and implementation have increasingly diverged. IMPACT: Those policy-makers and practitioners who have contact with civil servants and government ministers need to better understand the more fluid and unpredictable policy environment that is emerging at various tiers of UK governance, shaped by a multiplicity of actors sitting within, and outside, the formal boundaries of the state. The diverse ecology of policy-making institutions includes think-tanks, research institutes, non-governmental organizations, charities, community groups, management consultancies, and professional services companies, all of whom are involved in directly providing policy advice to ministers. The ‘monopoly’ over policy-making traditionally enjoyed by the civil service is eroding, with important implications for the work of policy-makers and public managers who have to negotiate the more fractious system of Whitehall bureaucracy. A subtle but perceptible shift is occurring whereby elected politicians and their advisers are gaining greater control over the policy-making processes of the UK state. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Civil service; policy advisory systems; politicization; post-bureaucratic state; Whitehall paradigm",,,,,,,"Aucoin, P., New political governance in Westminster systems: Impartial public administration and management performance at risk (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Bakvis, H., Jarvis, M.D., (2012) From new public management to new political governance: Essays in honour of Peter Aucoin, , McGill-Queen’s University Press; Barber, M., (2008) Instruction to deliver: Fighting to transform Britain’s public services, , Methuen; Bentham, J., The IPPR and Demos: Think-tanks of the new social democracy (2006) Political Quarterly, 77 (2), pp. 166-176; Brecknell, S., Gus attacks outsourcing of policy advice (2014) Civil Service World, , 16th May; Burnham, P., Pyper, J., (2008) Britain’s modernised civil service, , Palgrave Macmillan; Burnham, P., New labour and the politics of depoliticization (2001) British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 3 (2), pp. 127-149; Campbell, C., Wilson, G., (1995) The end of whitehall?

This development has been prompted chiefly by the strong politicization of the subject of integration and, as a consequence, a growing political interference with policymaking. Policy design and construction is predominantly carried out by policy officials in state bureaucracies. Some of these actors, however, have great difficulties with the restrictive turn in integration policies and the associated political discourse. Policy officials use the concept of professionalism to describe how they cope with the ambiguity between their personal convictions and the professional role they are expected to play. Thus, professionalism symbolizes cultural orientations, norms and values that are important in the bureaucratic organization. In this paper, we argue that the discourse of professionalism functions as a disciplinary logic that controls policy officials, but that simultaneously endows their work with meaning and creates a feeling of belonging. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This chapter maps out a complex network of government and political communication approaches in order to focus on the role that public sector communication plays in politics and policy. It identifies public sector communicators as the nonpartisan messengers of political issues. The challenges of politicization and permanent campaigning and the opportunities to participate in policy development and implementation are discussed. Public sector communication is distinguished as a specific field of knowledge and practice that has its own functions and challenges in its contribution to democratic processes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Bureaucracy; Policy; Politicization; Politics; Public relations; Public sector",,,,,,,"(2016) APS values and code of conduct in practice, , http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct-in-practice, Accessed August 25, 2016; Blumler, J.G., Coleman, S., Democracy and the media-revisited (2015) Javnost - The Public, 22, pp. 111-128. , https://doi.org/10.1080/13183222.2015.1041226; Blumler, J.G., Kavanagh, D., The third age of political communication: Influences and features (1999) Political Communication, 16, pp. 209-230. , https://doi.org/10.1080/105846099198596; Brown, J., Gaudin, P., Moran, W., (2013) PR and communication in local government and public services, , London: Kogan Page Publishers; Canel, M.J., Sanders, K., Introduction: Mapping the field of government communication (2013) Government communication cases and challenges, pp. 1-26. , K.

Using the case of environmental evaluation in local government, where natural resources comprise most of the local economy, this article discusses the politics of bureaucracy in undergoing daily governing processes. The environment and natural resource businesses are two opposing fields. Environmental evaluation becomes a contentious area and is usually highly political. This article identi-fies the bureaucracy’s politicisation in environmental evaluation as occuring in at least in two forms—in measurement and in project implementation. In terms of measurement, bureaucracy tends to use minimum standards, while in project implementation, there are some occasions where bureaucracy tends to sub-contract the work to the third party, usually NGOs, especially in relations to sensitive issues, so that it is politically safer for them, once the result is not as pleasing as expected. This article uses some cases in Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, Central Java, and Bangka Belitung, and applied case study as research approach. © 2020, Pacific Media Centre, Auckland University of Technology.

We note the institutionalization of the forms of the procedural unfolding of knowledge and the standardization of the narratives that express it. This fact has social consequences that are easy to identify: No knowledge (truth) is recognized unless it enters the circuit of the institutions that manage the knowledge networks and alternative narratives (to the standard ones) develop epistemologically relevant effects only when they are allocated relevant expression space (the institutional mechanisms of authoritarian imposition block any attempt at non-conforming discourse). 2) formal narratives of knowledge and their political function prove the entry of the sciences into the circuit of the economy of symbolic goods. In social practice, the mutual negotiation between the various forms of public authority and the (compliant) education systems is transparent. Public education puts into circulation metanarratives about science that have an implicit ideo-logical dimension. © 2020, Center Transylvanian Studies.

They provide cognitive and normative frameworks for policy-makers to advocate changes, to implement new programmes, and to create new types of public interventions (Lascoumes and Le Galès 2007). They contribute to the transformation of the State through the invention of new tools and devices, particularly metrics, which give legitimation to political aims, values, and ideologies. It corresponds to New Public Management which pretends reinventing tools of government and overcoming bureaucracy sometimes by reusing recipes from the past (Hood 1986). The instruments participate also in a kind of depoliticization and re-politicization of decision-making whereas policy-makers face many contestations and oppositions from different interest groups. As Michel Foucault demonstrated, these technical procedures of power and instrumentation are central to the art of governing and the development of a rationalizing State (Foucault 1977). Governmentality is not only based on measuring devices but also on intellectual and scientific technics, ways of thinking, epistemologies which become operational through metrics (Miller and Rose 2008). New relationships are established between science, expertise and politics that impact on the ownership, selectivity and choices of tools and instruments. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2020.",,,,,,,,"Ball, S.J., The teacher’s soul and the terrors of performativity (2003) Journal of Education Policy, 18 (2), pp. 215-228; Bashford, A., Nation, empire, globe: The spaces of population debate in the interwar years (2007) Comparative Studies in Society and History, 49, pp. 170-201; Berliner, D.C., Biddle, B.J., (1995) The manufactured crisis: Myth, fraud, and the attack on America’s public schools, , New York: Longman Publishers; Biesta, G., Why “what works” won’t work: Evidence-based practice and the democratic deficit in educational research (2007) Educational Theory, 57 (1), pp. 1-22; Bourdieu, P., Social space and symbolic power (1989) Sociological Theory, 7 (1), pp. 14-25; Bowker, G.C., Star, S.L., (2000) Sorting things out: Classification and its consequences, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Bruno, I., “Silencing the disbelievers”.

Firstly, we elaborate theoretical expectations about potential necessary conditions for cross-sectoral reforms. Secondly, we conduct a condition-oriented fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to examine our expectations, based on an original data set comparing policy integration and administrative coordination reforms, in environmental and unemployment policy, across 13 countries over 29 years. Our results indicate three necessary conditions for high reform intensity: external problem pressure is necessary for policy integration and administrative coordination in employment policy; either the strength or weakness of the reference party can take the role of necessary conditions depending on the policy field; low politicization of bureaucracy is necessary, especially for administrative coordination in environmental policy. These findings contribute to the development of a systematic theory of cross-sectoral policy and administrative change. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bureaucracy; Cross-sectoral reform; Party politics; Problem pressure; Public policy",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: 162832; Kommission zur FÃ¶rderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung, KWF","Joined-up government in the Western world in comparative perspective: A preliminary literature review and exploration (2004) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 14 (1), pp. 103-138. , https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muh006; Abou-Chadi, T., Niche party success and mainstream party policy shifts–how green and radical right parties differ in their impact (2016) British Journal of Political Science, 46 (2), pp. 417-436. , https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123414000155; Ansell, C., Gash, A., Collaborative governance in theory and practice (2008) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 18 (4), pp. 543-571. , https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/mum032; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., (2009) Agendas and instability in American politics, , 2nd ed., University of Chicago Press; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., Mortensen, P.B., Punctuated equilibrium theory: Explaining stability and change in public policymaking (2018) Theories of the Policy Process, pp. 55-102. , Weible C.M., Sabatier P., (eds), Westview Press, &,.

The research gap has focused on the antecedents of leader integrity within Iranian public services. This qualitative study used rich data from in-depth interviews and followed a Glaserian grounded theory as its research method. Results have suggested that, different factors influence leader integrity that include: individual characteristics (altruistic mindset, authenticity, organisational-based self-esteem, personal values that confer integrity, Machiavellianism), moderating factors (organisational: organisational climate regarding integrity, human resources management, whistleblower activities, organisational transparency and politicisation of bureaucracy) and moderating factors (managerial: leader job characteristics, leadership ability, expectations of leader performance, and ethical role model). We discuss a potential limitation of this study and implications for practice and directions for future research of leader integrity.

The same applies to the influence of corruption on trust, whether interpersonal or institutional. But there is no specific research on the impact of corruption on trust in civil servants. Especially in the European post-communist countries, which after 1989 showed institutional weakness and politicization of public administration, it is necessary to ask whether the accession to the European Union and the adoption of the civil service laws helped to reduce corruption in the eyes of citizens and mainly to increase their trust in civil servants. However, the analysis carried out in seven post-communist countries reveals that people still do not trust the civil servants much. In addition, public not only perceives a significant number of civil servants as corrupt, but even encounters corrupt cases while dealing with them. Corruption is also a phenomenon that reduces citizens' trust in civil servants. © 2020 Institute of Political Studies.

Our commissioned research was being carried out in the context of significant policy change for lone parents in Ireland which saw the introduction of labour market activation. The research was initially used by the then Government to appease the Opposition to the highly emotive policy change. Following a general election, Opposition and advocacy groups called on policymakers to acknowledge the report they had commissioned. Concepts of research(er) deficit, normative reality and a shifting 'policy agora' are explored to highlight how the political context shaped the uptake of the research findings. We followed the debate by drawing on publicly available documentary evidence relevant to the policy of lone parent activation in Ireland from pertinent parliamentary and committee debates involving all stakeholders, that is the Government, civil servants, Opposition and advocacy groups, to ascertain what happened with the research and why did it happen. Attention is given to the consequences of producing outputs that diverge from political values and ideologies, whereby research can be subject to manipulation to discredit and invalidate findings. © 2019 Policy Press.","Ireland; Lone parents; Policy based evidence; Research(er) deficit",,,,,,"Irish Research Council","(2016), https://onefamily.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NGO-Submission-on-Actions-to-Achieve-Child-Poverty-Target.pdf, Better Outcomes: Brighter Futures NGO Sub-Group on Child Poverty, Submission on Actions to Achieve the Child Poverty Reduction Target; Brown, C, The policy agora: how power inequalities affect the interaction between researchers and policy makers (2014) Evidence & Policy, 10 (3), pp. 421-438; Burton, J, Dáil Debates, 748 (10). , http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2011/12/09/00005.asp#N265, 9/12/2011; Burton, J, Seanad Éireann Debate, 239 (6). , http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015041500001?opendocument, 15/04/2015; Crosse, R, Millar, M, Parenting alone in contemporary Ireland (2015) Learning on the job: parenting in modern Ireland, pp. 184-204. , Doherty, C, Jackson, A (eds), Cork: Oak Tree Press; (2015) Survey on income and living conditions, , Central Statistics Office, Dublin: CSO; Curran, J, Joint Committee on Social Protection Debate, , http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/Debates%20Authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016100600002?opendocument#D00100, 06/10/2016; (2006) Proposals for supporting lone parents, , DSFA (Department of Social and Family Affairs), Dublin: Stationery Office; Duffin, S, Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection Debate, , http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/Debates%20Authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015021800002?opendocument#K00100, 18/02/2015; Egan, N, Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection Debate, , http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/Debates%20Authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015021800002?opendocument#K00100, 18/02/2015; Frazer, H, Silencing dissent, , https://mediabite.org/2009/07/07/silencing-dissent-by-hugh-frazer-former-director-of-combat-poverty-agency/, 07/07/2009, Irish Examiner; Guba, EG, Lincoln, YS, Competing paradigms in qualitative research in Denzin (1994) Handbook of Qualitative Research, pp. 105-117. , DK, Lincoln, YS (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Hick, R, Enter the Troika: the politics of social security during Ireland's bailout (2018) Social Policy, 47 (1), pp. 1-20; Higgins, MA, Joint Committee on Social Protection Debate, , http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/Debates%20Authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2016111700002?opendocument#B00300, 29/11/2016; (2017) Report of The Joint Committee On Social Protection, Report on the position of lone parents in Ireland, , http://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/committee/dail/32/joint-committee-on-social-protection/reports/2017/2017-06-15-report-on-the-position-of-lone-parents-in-ireland-en.pdf, Houses of the Oireachtas, Dublin: Houses of the Oireachtas; (2017) Indecon Independent Review of the Amendments to the One Parent Family Payment since 2012, , Indecon Dublin: Indecon; Press release, Social Protection Committee to discuss lone parents with Department, , http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/mediazone/pressreleases/2016/name-39162-en.html, JOCSP, 5/10/2016; Mauthner, NS, Doucet, A, Reflections on a voice-centred relational method of data analysis: analysing maternal and domestic voices (1998) Feminist dilemmas in qualitative research: private lives and public texts, , Ribbens, J, Edwards, R (eds), London: Sage; Millar, M, Coen, L, Rau, H, Donegan, M, Canavan, J, Bradley, C, (2007) Towards a better future: research on labour market needs and social inclusion of one parent families in Galway city and county, , Galway: UNESCO Centre for Child and Family Research, NUI Galway; Millar, M, Crosse, R, (2016) Lone parents and activation, what works and why: a review of the international evidence in the Irish context, , UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre, NUI Galway; Millar, M, Crosse, R, Lone parent activation in Ireland: putting the cart before the horses?

While considered an effective instrument to safeguard political control over ministerial bureaucracy, partisanship of senior civil servants is likewise associated with patronage and is deemed detrimental to professionalism and meritocracy. To scrutinize this contradiction, the article examines how the party-political background of senior civil servants influences their decision-making behaviour. Two theoretically derived conceptions of loyalty are therefore put to the test: responsiveness and responsibility. Effects are captured by using the vignette technique in 40 in-depth interviews with former senior civil servants from ministerial departments at federal and state level in Germany. The results are surprising in so far as they reveal that politicized senior civil servants act neither more responsively nor less responsibly than their non-politicized peers. These findings challenge common assumptions and call for a more refined analysis of the conditions under which politicization leads to negative effects. © 2019 The Author.

There is substantial variation in the degree of direct politicization and in managerial autonomy. This article tests four sets of hypotheses to explain variation in perceptions of direct politicization and managerial autonomy in European public sectors. Data from a new survey in 15 countries among several thousand top public sector managers in central government are used. Findings show that variation in perceived direct politicization and managerial autonomy is partially determined by the formal status of an organization as an agency, and the hierarchical position of the manager within the organization. Managers from very large organizations also experience more autonomy, but organization size has no impact on perceived politicization. The policy field within which the respondent’s organization is situated has mixed effects. The article also finds that the models are better at explaining the variation in perceived managerial autonomy than that in direct politicization. Points for practitioners The article shows that top public managers in European central administration perceive different levels in the extent to which politicians try to influence senior-level appointments, as well as in the extent of management autonomy that they have. These differences in perception are mainly explained by whether or not they work in an agency, as well as by the hierarchical position that they occupy within the organization. © The Author(s) 2018.","managerial autonomy; politicization; top civil servants","administrative framework; civil rights; civil service; civil society; political development; public sector; Europe",,,,,"77/202, 78/304","Alford, J., Hartley, J., Yates, S., (2016), (,) Into the purple zone: Deconstructing the politics/administration distinction., online first; Antonsen, M., Jørgensen, T.B., The ‘publicness’ of public organizations (1997) Public Administration, 75 (2), pp. 337-357; Bauer, M.W., Ege, J., Politicization within the European Commission’s bureaucracy (2012) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 78 (3), pp. 403-424; Bellò, B., Spano, A., Governing the purple zone: How politicians influence public managers (2015) European Management Journal, 33 (5), pp. 354-365; Charron, N., Dahlström, C., Lapuente, V., Measuring meritocracy in the public sector in Europe: A new national and sub-national indicator (2016) European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research, 22 (3), pp. 499-523; Christensen, T., Laegreid, P., New Public Management: The effects of contractualism and devolution on political control (2001) Public Management Review, 3 (1), pp. 73-94; Dahlström, C., Pierre, J., Steering the Swedish state: Politicization as a coordination strategy (2011) Steering from the Centre: Strengthening Political Control in Western Democracies, pp. 193-211. , Dahlström C., Peters B.G., Pierre J., (eds), Toronto, University of Toronto Press, In:, (eds; Di Mascio, F., Exploring the link between patronage and party institutionalization: An historical-institutional analysis of the Italian transition (2013) Democratization, 21 (4), pp. 678-698; Egeberg, M., Trondal, J., Political leadership and bureaucratic autonomy: Effects of agencification (2009) Governance, 22 (4), pp. 673-688; Evans, P., Rauch, J.E., Bureaucracy and growth: A cross-national analysis of the effects of Weberian state structures on economic growth (1999) American Sociological Review, 64 (5), pp. 748-765; Fukuyama, F., What is governance?

Michelsen Institute, Bergen, Norway","Based on five months’ field research in two districts of Burundi (Bukeye and Mabayi), this case study analyses tax collectors’ rationales and informal practices during their interactions with citizens. The analysis also examines local governance, in order to understand how informal practices are accepted, legitimised and even supported by local authorities. Field observations reveal a fluctuating balance of power, and the various constraints and room for manoeuvre used by local agents dealing with tax payers. Further, an investigation into tax enforcement provides a basis for measuring the discrepancy between, on the one hand, formal good governance norms and standards of behaviour and, on the other, informal strategies developed by local civil servants and officials. The article demonstrates that corruption is mainly a social phenomenon, far from its formal definition, which generally refers only to the search of private gains. Corruption is systemic and part of the current CNDD-FDD party’s governance framework in Burundi, relying on public administration’s politicisation, solidarity networks and socio-economic factors. More broadly, the article shows that corruption labelling remains topical to spur a State conception and structural changes through ‘good governance’ and anti-corruption norms. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Burundi; corruption; good governance; legal pluralism; power balance",,,,,,,"Anders, G., (2009) In the Shadow of Good Governance: An Ethnography of Civil Service Reform in Africa, , Leiden: Brill, Afrika-Studiecentrum Series; Baez Camargo, C., (2017) Corruption, Social Norms and Behaviours: A Comparative Assessment of Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, , Basel: Basel Institute on Governance; Barilari, A., Le consentement à l’impôt, fragile mais indispensable aporie (2007) Regards croisés sur l’économie, 1 (1), pp. 27-34; Bayart, J.F., (1993) The State in Africa: The Politics of the Belly, , London: Longman; Bernheim, E., Le ‘pluralisme normatif’: un nouveau paradigme pour appréhender les mutations sociales et juridiques ?

Focusing on the case of the Baghdadi Jewish physician and vizier Sad al-Dawla (d. 1291), I explore how the Jewish minister sought to take advantage of Twelver-Shī ī rise to prominence under the Mongols. I argue that the vizier attempted to strike an alliance with the Shī ī communities in Iraq and with influential Shī ī families with long-established ties to the Mongol regime, in order to curtail resistance to his policies and to the Jewish dominance in the realm's bureaucracy. I consider Sad al-Dawla's endeavors within the broader historical context of Shī ī-Jewish relations. The article concludes by examining the two decades following Sad al-Dawla's downfall, when a group of eminent Jewish physicians at the Mongol court converted to Islam.

The overall aim of the system is to identify and address gaps in order to prevent future death but, to date, around 10% of the expected number of deaths are reported. This article examines practices and reasoning involved in maternal death reporting and review practices in Ethiopia, building on the concept of 'practical norms'. The study is based on multi-sited fieldwork at different levels of the Ethiopian health system including interviews, document analysis and observations, and has documented the politicized nature of MDSR implementation. Death reporting and review are challenged by the fact that maternal mortality is a main indicator of health system performance. Health workers and bureaucrats strive to balance conflicting demands when implementing the MDSR system: to report all deaths; to deliver perceived success in maternal mortality reduction by reporting as few deaths as possible; and to avoid personalized accountability for deaths. Fear of personal and political accountability for maternal deaths strongly influences not only reporting practices but also the care given in the study sites. Health workers report maternal deaths in ways that minimize their number and deflect responsibility for adverse outcomes. They attribute deaths to community and infrastructural factors, which are often beyond their control. The practical norms of how health workers report deaths perpetuate a skewed way of seeing problems and solutions in maternal health. On the basis of our findings, we argue that closer attention to the broader political context is needed to understand the implementation of MDSR and other surveillance systems. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.","Ethiopia; indicators; maternal health; MDSR; multi-sited ethnography","adverse outcome; attention; controlled study; Ethiopia; ethnography; fear; field work; health care personnel; human; interview; maternal death; maternal mortality; maternal welfare; outcome assessment; prevention; reasoning; responsibility; review; cultural anthropology; epidemiological monitoring; epidemiology; Ethiopia; female; health care quality; health survey; maternal death; politics; pregnancy; procedures; Anthropology, Cultural; Epidemiological Monitoring; Ethiopia; Female; Humans; Maternal Death; Politics; Population Surveillance; Pregnancy; Quality of Health Care",,,,,"Universitetet i Bergen, UiB; Norges Forskningsråd: 223269; Norway Grants","Aalen, L., Tronvoll, K., The end of democracy?

The study conceptualizes politicization as increased use of political advisors – known as “cabinets” in the EC context – by the Commissioners to ensure political direction over the work of the civil service. Commissioners’ private cabinets fulfil several functions, one of which is political steering of the policy work in the departments. The study argues that as a result of the NPM-style reform and strengthening of the civil service accountability to the political level, the political steering function of the cabinet advisors grew in importance. To examine whether the political steering function of cabinets became more important after the reform, the study analyzed the lists of cabinets’ responsibilities available online from the Prodi to the Junker Commissions. The content of the lists of responsibilities was first coded and then statistically analyzed testing for the effect of the reform on the structure of cabinets’ responsibilities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cabinets; civil servants; European Commission; policy advice; politicization",,,,,,,"Balint, T., Bauer, M.W., Knill, C., Bureaucratic Change in the European Administrative Space: The Case of the European Commission (2008) West European Politics, 31 (4), pp. 677-700; Bauer, M.V., Ege, J., Politicization Within the European Commission’s Bureaucracy (2012) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 78 (3), pp. 403-424; Bauer, M.V., Ege, J., Commission Civil Servants and Politics: De-politicised Bureaucrats in an Increasingly Political Organisation (2013) Civil Servants and Politics: A Delicate Balance, pp. 173-204. , Neuhold C., Vanhoonacker S., Verhey L., (eds), London: Palgrave Macmillan, and,. edited by; van den Berg, C.F., (2011) Transforming for Europe: The Reshaping of National Bureaucracies in a System of Multilevel Governance, , Leiden: Leiden University Press; van den Berg, C.F., van der Heijden, M., Pressure on Impartial Policy Advice: An Agenda for Comparative Research (2012) Paper presented at IPSA XXIIth World Congress of Political Science, , Madrid: July 8–12; Brans, M., Steen, T., From Incremental to Copernican Reform?

This article analyses the case of public administration in Romania, which, at first glance, appears to have embraced policy transfer as part of the process of Europeanisation and other modernisation initiatives emanating from international institutions such as the World Bank. Based on interviews with policy elites in Romania, the authors establish that those elites were not interested in learning about administrative improvements from abroad because they were self-evidently workable but because it satisfied key external actors. Furthermore, the high degree of politicisation of the Romanian bureaucracy, which remains a legacy of its Communist past, continues to act as a barrier to change, and may result in the reversal of reforms now EU membership is fully established. © The Author(s) 2017.","Country analysis; EU accession; Europeanisation; international organizations; policy learning; policy transfer; public administration; public services; Romania",,,,,,,"Andrei, T., Profiroiu, M., Oancea, B., Analysis of mobility issues and politicization of the civil service in public administration in Romania (2012) Transylvanian Review of Administrative Sciences, 36, pp. 5-21; Balan, C., Varia, G., Iftene, C., (2010) The Right to a Good Administration and its Impact on Public Administration’s Procedures, , Bucharest, Comunicare; Beuselinck, E., Verhoest, K., Bouckaert, G., Reforms of central government coordination in OECD-countries: Culture as counterforce for cross-national unifying processes (2007) Cultural Aspects of Public Management Reform, 16, pp. 77-115. , Schedler K and Proeller I (eds), Research in Public Policy and Management, Bingley, UK: Emerald; Borzel, T., Risse, T., From Europeanisation to diffusion: Introduction (2012) West European Politics, 35 (1), pp. 1-19; Burnham, P., Lutz, K.G., Grant, W., (2008) Research Methods in Politics, , 2nd ed, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Caiden, N., Wildavsky, A., (1974) Planning and Budgeting in Poor Countries, , New York, John Wiley and Sons; Calinoiu, C., Considerations on the reinforcement of the public administration reform in Romania (2015) Journal of Law and Administrative Sciences Special Issue, pp. 496-511; Common, R., International trends in HRM in the public sector: Reform attempts in the Republic of Georgia (2011) International Journal of Public Sector Management, 24 (5), pp. 421-434; Costa, E., Kiss, A., Dealing with opposition: Uncomfortable moments in research (2011) European Educational Research Journal, 10 (2), pp. 242-251; Dimitrova, A., Buzogany, A., Post-accession policy-making in Bulgaria and Romania: Can non-state actors use EU rules to promote better governance?

Presidents and congresses do not confer such expertise when they delegate responsibility for policy making. Existing research suggests that elected officials’ efforts to gain control of federal agencies can reduce agency expertise by inducing civil servants to exit the agency and reducing incentives for civil servants to exert effort, including acquiring policy expertise. I use data from an original survey of federal executives to examine whether politicization reduces agency expertise. I find that civil servants whose policy preferences diverge from those of political appointees are more likely to perceive that their agency is politicized and that civil servants who perceive their agency is politicized are more likely to exit the agency and less likely to engage in behaviors that build policy expertise. In total, these findings provide systematic, microlevel evidence demonstrating how politicization can reduce agency policy expertise. © 2019 by the Southern Political Science Association.

The paper examines whether coalition government imposed ‘checks and balances’ that prevented Conservative ministers from enacting a further wave of New Public Management-style reforms of the permanent bureaucracy comparable to New Political Governance. The central argument of the article is that the institutional resilience of Westminster systems, particularly their capacity to safeguard norms of public service impartiality and non-partisanship in the face of the politicisation and externalisation of the policy-making process, has been underestimated. Nevertheless, Aucoin's concerns about the erosion of non-partisan affiliation in the civil service of the Anglophone countries remain apposite. © The Author(s) 2017.","Governance; majoritarianism; New Public Management; public administration; Whitehall",,,,,,,"Addison, P., (1976) The Road to 1945, , London, Quartet Books; Agbonlahor, W., (2013) Lord butler criticises churn among perm secs, , Civil Service World, London; Ashcroft, M., Oakeshott, (2016) Call Me Dave: The Unauthorised Biography of David Cameron, , Oxford, Blackwell; Aucoin, P., New Political Governance in Westminster systems: Impartial public administration and management performance at risk (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Bakvis, H., Jarvis, M., Introduction: Peter C.

Existing studies failed to examine how the role of clientelism changes with the increasing tenure of the incumbent party. Combining data from the Afrobarometer project and information about partisan turnover, this article shows that the longer a party has remained in power, the more clientelist exchanges in the form of club goods and patronage will serve to bolster popular support for the ruling party. This is mainly because lengthy party duration facilitates the politicization of bureaucracy and other state resources essential for clientelist exchanges. Understanding the evolving role of clientelism under electoral contestation has profound implications for the study of phenomena such as dominant-party rule and democratic erosion. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","Clientelism;

Based on extensive archival material, the article focuses on the contingencies often obscured by historical narratives that treat socialist rites of passage as mere substitutes for church rites. An analysis of the deliberations of party officials and state bureaucracies about the name giving ceremony reveals a complex of trial and error and experimentation and a series of unanswered questions about the specific meaning of the new ritual. Unlike the socialist confirmation, the Jugendweihe, which fulfilled a concrete function in the political education of the youth and received continuous state support, the name giving ceremony sheds a different light on the socialist state as an altogether reluctant participant in ritual practices. © Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht GmbH & Co.

The president is expected to be the chief legislator, chief economist, chief psychiatrist, and chief diplomat for the nation and is the cog around which national affairs revolve. However, a politicized presidency signals the downfall of the managerial presidency that was buttressed by agencies with neutral competence. This article traces the evolution of an American budgetary agency, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from its inception to the present, documenting the baleful impact of the politicized presidency on the OMB. Amid politicization, the OMB lost its professional reputation for neutral competence and was replaced by the Congressional Budget Office as the foremost authority on national budgetary matters.

According to a long-held view of EU policy-making, the latter is characterised by the absence of politicisation.

At home vested interest block reforms favorable to powerless groups while the majoritarian residue of liberal democracy formally prevents the state from serving as an unmediated arm of the ruling class. The single most noteworthy feature of the public life of late capitalism is the intransigence of bureaucracy. The problems associated with politicization, centralization, decentralization, and rationalization reinforce the point that in late capitalism public administration assumes many of the contradictions once existing in the economy. The ambiguities, confusions, and irrationalities of the late capitalist state adversely affect the quest for legitimation. A central political development of late capitalist society has been an increase in the tendency to view the state as capable of solving problems that lie outside its competence. The reification of the state is a key aspect of the political life of late capitalist societies. © 1993 by Taylor & Francis.

Previous research indicates that Malaysia has a superior governance system compared to Indonesia. To support the performance of civil servants, Malaysia has the Sabah Public Service Center. This institution performs a supervisory role and is also involved in career development. Malaysia ranked third in quality of governance among ASEAN countries as it always upholds the principles of professionalism. Although Malaysia previously had a reputation of corrupt practices, the Malaysian government immediately took measures to restore the country's image. Whereas in Indonesia, since regional autonomy, practices of corruption and politicization of the bureaucracy have always stigmatized the government both at central and regional levels. Although the State Civil Service Commission (KASN) is responsible for recruiting and developing a bureaucratic career, there are still practices of bribery and corruption.

The foreign policy institutions of all three countries witnessed new forms of political agency, with diplomats beginning to question, debate and (re)define routine practices and norms. Combining diplomatic theory with the multidisciplinary literature on state bureaucracies, this article analyses the various strategies that diplomats developed during a time marked by radical politicisation, strong emotion and new opportunities. On a conceptual level, it emphasises the concept of 'diplomatic discretion', which remains under-theorised in diplomacy research today, but is crucial to the study of diplomatic practice. Empirically, this article draws on ethnographic data regarding diplomats' lived experiences, treating their narratives surrounding the 2011 events as a starting point of analysis. © 2019 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","diplomatic discretion; diplomatic practice; diplomatic service; diplomatic theory; Middle East; multi-site ethnography; resistance; state bureaucracy",,,,,,,"Whyte, W.H., (2002) The Organization Man, p. 14. , Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press; Albert, O., (1970) Hirschman, Exit, Voice and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations and States, , London: Harvard University Press; Lipsky, M., (2010) Street Level Bureaucracy: Dilemmas of the Individual in Public Services, , New York, NY: The Russell Sage Foundation; Zacka, B., (2017) When the State Meets the Street: Public Service and Moral Agency, , London: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; Sharma, A., Gupta, A., (2006) The Anthropology of the State, , eds), Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell; Sharma, A., Gupta, A., (2006) The Anthropology of the State, , eds), Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell; Jones, A., Clark, J., 'Mundane diplomacies for the practice of european geopolitics (2015) Geoforum, 62, pp. 1-12; Kuus, M., (2014) Geopolitics and Expertise: Knowledge and Authority in European Diplomacy, , Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell; Neumann, I.B., (2015) To Be a Diplomat', International Studies Perspectives, 6, pp. 72-93; Neumann, I.B., 'A speech that the entire ministry may stand for, or why diplomats never produce anything new' (2007) International Political Sociology, 1, pp. 183-200; Pouliot, V., (2010) International Security in Practice: The Politics of NATO-Russia Diplomacy, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Dittmer, J., (2017) Diplomatic Material: Affect, Assemblage and Foreign Policy, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Jones, A., Clark, J., 'Performance, emotions and diplomacy in the united nations assemblage in New York (2019) Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 109 (4), pp. 1262-1278; Gay, P.D., (2007) Organizing Identity: Persons and Organizations 'After Theory', , London: SAGE; Du, G., Organizing Identity, pp. 127-128; Applbaum, A.I., (1999) Ethics for Adversaries: The Morality of Roles in Public and Professional Life, p. 124. , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Du, G., Organizing Identity, p. 115; Weber, M., (1978) Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology, p. 975. , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, [1922; Satow, E., (1917) Satow's Guide to Diplomatic Practice, , London: Longman; Nicolson, H., (1939) Diplomacy, , London: Oxford University Press; Barston, R.P., (1998) Modern Diplomacy, , London: Routledge; Kissinger, H., (1994) Diplomacy, , New York, NY: Simon & Schuster; Murray, S., 'Diplomatic theory and the evolving canon of diplomatic studies (2011) International Studies, 13 (4), pp. 709-728. , Review; Sending, O.J., Pouliot, V., Neumann, I.B., (2015) Diplomacy and the Making of World Politics, pp. 2-3. , eds), (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press); Murray, Diplomatic Theory and the Evolving Canon of Diplomatic Studies', p. 720; Ross, C., (2007) Independent Diplomat: Dispatches from An Unaccountable Elite, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Nicolson, H., (1946) The Congress of Vienna, p. 164. , London: Constable; Keens-Soper, M., Schweizer, K.W., 'Diplomatic theory in the ancien régime (1983) Francois de Callières: The Art of Diplomacy, pp. 19-53. , in Maurice Keens-Soper and Karl W.

It was mainly settled by the law of 1 July 1901 whose application was entrusted to the Council of State (Conseil d'État). The analysis of its general assembly highlights, grounded on the combination of members' positions and biographical data, the confrontation of two camps. Catholic defenders of congregations use “legal fiction” strategies to maintain the existence of religious companies. The Council of State, although subject to a duty of reserve and to an obligation of neutrality, became for a few years a discreet political arena. This politicization is limited by the sense of duty of high civil servants who manage to reconcile the demands of their service with an hidden opposition. This survey stresses some of the features of a Catholic interpretation of the law, which seeks to recognize the spontaneous life of institutions instead of coercing it. It also shows the strategies of an institution to maintain itself in a hostile political context. The Council has found its balance within the new republican institutions by arranging the cohabitation of the new republican law with the law of the preceding political regimes. The Conseil d'État was responsible for deciding on the life or death of religious institutions, and organizes its own survival by taking life sparingly and seeking harmony of jurisprudence everywhere. © Presses Universitaires de France.

Overlooked are daily requests to executive agencies made by legislators that propose policies, communicate concerns, and request information or services. Analyzing over 24,000 of these requests made to 13 executive agencies between 2007 and 2014, I find agencies systematically prioritize the policy-related requests of majority party legislators—but that this effect can be counteracted when presidents politicize agencies through appointments. An increase in politicization produces a favorable agency bias toward presidential copartisans. This same politicization, however, has a net negative impact on agency responsiveness—agencies are less responsive to members of Congress, but even less responsive to legislators who are not presidential copartisans. Critically, this negative impact extends beyond policy-related requests to cases of constituency service.

I argue that to appreciate when and how history matters, we need to consider public service bargains struck between politicians and senior bureaucrats. Doing so complicates the relationship between historical and current administrative systems: a bureaucratic, as opposed to patrimonial, 18th-century state infrastructure is necessary for the depoliticization of ministerial bureaucracies in present-day Western Europe. However, the relationship does not hold in East-Central Europe since administrative histories are tumultuous and fractured. Combining data from across the European continent, I provide evidence in support of these propositions. Points for practitioners: This article addresses policymakers dealing with reforms of personnel policy regimes at the centre of government. It considers the importance of history for politically attractive reforms, as well as the limits of this importance. I argue that 18th-century state infrastructures shape the extent to which political appointments are politically attractive tools for administrative control. I show that only in countries that feature a bureaucratic, as opposed to patrimonial, 18th-century infrastructure are ministerial top management occupied by a permanent, as opposed to politically appointed, staff. However, in East-Central Europe, a ruptured administrative history ensures that the distant past does not similarly shape the extent of political appointments. © The Author(s) 2016.","administrative traditions; central administration; comparative public administration; historical legacies; personnel policies","administrative system; bureaucracy; civil service; historical perspective; political geography; political history; public administration; public service; theoretical study; Europe",,,,,,"Alvarez de Cienfuegos, I.M., Spain: Still the primacy of corporatism?

The paper provides the first systematic analysis of this important development in institutional design using a novel data set on the organization of public communication in 48 IOs between 1950 and 2015. It identifies self-legitimation as a key driver of centralization in the face of increased levels of politicization, that is, public awareness and activism directed at IOs. Empirically, the study suggests that the centralization of public communication significantly increases as transnational civil society organizes and gains access to IO decision-making. Further, politicization in terms of contentious activism and public scandals substantially accounts for varying levels of centralization across IOs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Communication; Institutional design; International organization; Legitimation; Non-state access; Political protest; Political scandal; Politicization; Transnational civil society",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: EC 323/1-2","Abbott, K.W., Snidal, D., Why states act through formal international organizations (1998) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 42 (1), pp. 3-32; Aghi, M., McKee, N., (2000) Involving people, evolving behaviour, , Southbound and United Nations Childrens Fund, Penang and New York; Aldrich, H., Herker, D., Boundary spanning roles and organization structure (1977) Academy of Management Review, 2 (2), pp. 217-230; Alleyne, M.D., Global lies?: Propaganda, the UN, and world order (2003) Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, , Palgrave Macmillan, New York; Altides, C., (2009) Making EU politics public.

As a candidate, Trump promised to run government like his business. His supporters and critics, however, disagree about how the president has performed as a manager. In this article, we review President Trump's performance as a manager during his first year in office. We examine three dimensions of his approach—transition preparation, staffing, and management style. Notably, we find that the president's halting transition limited his effectiveness in the first year. Unlike previous presidents, President Trump chose neither a politicizing nor a centralizing strategy to gain control over administrative policy making during his first year. We also note that President Trump prefers a competitive and freewheeling decision-making environment but is struggling with the consequences of such a structure. The article concludes with an assessment of the first year and prospects for the president moving forward. © 2018 Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress","bureaucracy; centralization; management; politicization; president; staffing; transition",,,,,,"Vanderbilt University, VU","Adragna, A., (2018) “GOP Friendly Fire Imperils Trump Nominees, , https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/08/republicans-trump-nominees-397714, Politico, February 8,, (accessed March 19, 2018); (2016) “Donald Trump Says He'll Run America Like His Business, , http://fortune.com/2016/10/27/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-business-management/, Fortune, October 27,, (accessed March 24, 2018); Balluck, K., (2018) “Priebus Counsels White House Staff to Ignore ‘Distractions, , http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/376632-priebus-counsels-white-house-staff-to-ignore-distractions, The Hill, March 4,, (accessed March 28, 2018); Berman, R., (2017) “A President Without an Administration, , https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/trump-transition-cabinet-behind-schedule/511928/, The Atlantic, January 3,, (accessed March 17, 2018); Berman, R., (2017) “President Trump's ‘Substitute Teacher’ Problem, , https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/president-trumps-substitute-teacher-problem/523101/, The Atlantic, April 17,, (accessed April 2, 2018); Brehm, J., Gages, S., (1999) Working, Shirking, and Sabotage, , Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press; Bressman, L., Vandenbergh, M., “Inside the Administrative State: A Critical Look at the Practice of Presidential Control (2006) Michigan Law Review, 105, pp. 47-100; Burke, J.P., (2000) Presidential Transitions: From Politics to Practice, , Boulder, CO, Lynne Rienner; Burke, J.P., (2004) Becoming President: The Bush Transition, 2000-2003, , Boulder, CO, Lynne Rienner; Burke, J.P., “The Obama Transition: An Early Assessment (2009) Presidential Studies Quarterly, 39, pp. 574-604; Chappell, B., (2017) “‘I'm The Only One That Matters,’ Trump Says of State Dept.

Despite its many achievements, public administration has its problems, generally the product of conflicts between tradition and modernity.

The high level of potential access to government information in Slovakia does not ""produce"" increased accountability, predictability and also does not effectively serve as a tool to control corruption. We argue that citizens are not only victims, but also accomplishers: their tolerance for corruption, excessive bureaucracy and rentseeking is confirmed by many existing studies. Concerning civil service reform, Slovakia shows a substantial reform reversal towards politicisation and centralisation after 2001, which clearly threatens the fundamental features of democratic governance. Soon after the EU accession in 2004 major regressive changes took place, and the Civil Service Office was abolished in 2006. The new legislation in force from 2017 (forced by the EU conditionality) should return the Slovak civil service back on the right track - let us to see. With regard to self-government the reforms aimed towards the establishment of more independent local and regional self-government. However, the major issue here is the extreme fragmentation on the municipal level - almost 3,000 municipalities in the country, most of them bellow 1,000 inhabitants. Many studies confirm that amalgamation (or at least functional amalgamation) is necessary - but there is no political will to start it. What are the main lessons from the Slovak case ? The information provided indicates that the Slovak Republic belongs to the ""standard"" group of CEE countries - after the first wave of democratisation reforms immediately after 1989, most of the later changes were realised ""thanks to"" external motivations and pressures - and not always really welcomed. The specific issue, however, is the decentralisation reform in 2000 - 2005. This change, providing really fragmented local self-government by extra rights and responsibilities, was internally driven, with positive results from the point of view of self-government principles, but with many hurdles caused by too large a number of too small municipalities. © 2018 Stanisław Mazur et al., published by Sciendo 2018.",,,,,,,,"Baldersheim, H., Rose, L., (2008) A Comparative Analysis of Territorial Choice in Europe, , Oslo: Political Institute; Bours, A., (1993) Management, Tiers, Size and Amalgamations of Local Government: Local Government in the New Europe, , London: Belhaven; Bovaird, T., Löffler, E., Evaluating the Quality of Public Governance: Indicators, Models and Methodologies (2003) International Review of Administrative Scien.s, 69 (3), pp. 313-328; Bovaird, T., Löffler, E., (2009) Public Management and Governance, , London: Routledge; Bucek, M., Nemec, J., Local Government in Slovakia (2012) Local Government in the Member States of the European Union: A Comparative Legal Perspective, pp. 555-576. , A.

This article is an initial attempt at examining the demand for policy consulting in a developing country. It sought to confirm whether the trends in policy advice–externalization and proceduralization–found in developed countries are present in an emerging economy such as the Philippines based on an extensive coding and analysis of a recently made public database of bid notices for consulting services. The study confirms that the demand for external policy advice is growing in Philippines, as expected from a government of a developing country. The proceduralization hypothesis of externalizing process-related work is partially confirmed but strategic policy advice is also found to be important where the government almost equally also outsources substantive, highly specialized advice.

Based on a review of the literature in sociology, political science, and anthropology about IOs, the purpose is to provide an analysis of the dialectic about politicization and depoliticization in IOs. We identify the main processes through which depoliticization is operated by IOs: the use of ethics and norms, the political neutralization of their official rhetoric, and the resorting to multiform expertise as a means of apolitical self-legitimization. We also explore the factors that may explain this tendency to depoliticize: their problematic status in regard to democratic theory, the diplomatic constraints attached to the intergovernmental structure of their managing bodies, and the administrative and cultural constraints that befall IOs’ bureaucracies. Finally, we try to go beyond the concept of depoliticization by stressing the consequences of politicization that stem from IOs’ resilient political rhetoric and from the ethical norms and expertise produced by IOs. Because IOs cannot totally eliminate political controversy and debates, the idea of ‘international depoliticized governance’ as a result of IOs activity should be put into perspective. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","depoliticization; discourse; expertise; International organizations; norms; politicization",,,,,,"International Monetary Fund; World Bank Group; World Health Organization; Illinois Ornithology Society; International Atomic Energy Agency","Abélès, M., Le global politique et ses scènes (2011) Des anthropologues à l’OMC, pp. 111-140. , Abélès M., (ed), Paris: CNRS Éditions,.

The central question posed is how U.K. climate modellers developed rhetoric, managed expectations, and weighed their professional and political responsibilities in the face of growing political interest in climate change. Whilst the modellers were reluctant to allow the modelling results to be used for political ends, U.K. civil servants saw climate modelling as a modern tool for a new problem. As scientific and political agendas diverged, the director of the Meteorological Office, John Mason, found himself caught between his position as a government employee in a service organization and his responsibility as a gatekeeper between climate models and their potential uses. Ultimately, as Mason and his modellers were forced to admit, their climate models became cultural and political as well as scientific objects. © 2018 by the Regents of the University of California.

It is, however, largely unknown why executive politicians promote some officials rather than others to high public office. Based on a unique dataset of all senior officials in German federal ministries and agencies that held office in the period 1997-2015, this article investigates whether partisan loyalty, political craft, and managerial competencies influence the chance of promotion to the highest civil service position in Germany (state secretary). We apply event history modeling to draw inferences on the relative importance of different selection criteria used by ministers when recruiting state secretaries from a candidate pool of senior officials. A key finding is that ministers consistently prefer politically loyal to nonloyal candidates. Although ministers also consider candidates' political craft and selected managerial competencies, they are likely to trade-off partisan loyalty against those qualifications. The article contributes to the literature on politicization in the public sector by comparing potential and actual office holders and by including a broad set of selection criteria, moving beyond the literature's dominating focus on partisan loyalty. The methodological approach developed in this article may well be transferred to other institutional contexts and used for comparative studies in this area. © The Author(s) 2017.",,,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ.

However, to this point, much of what we know of unilateral powers does not adequately address the role the bureaucracy plays in the president's decision. This research seeks to account for bureaucratic factors as a strategic presidential consideration in the employment of such directives. I classify executive orders from 1989–2012 based on which agency or agencies they apply to, and consider the importance of various characteristics (e.g. agency ideology, level of centralization, politicization, etc.) in determining which organs of the bureaucracy presidents will direct executive orders to generally. The results provide evidence that the White House directs fewer executive orders to agencies that have a politically independent leadership structure, and this result holds across a variety of measures judging an order's impact. The results demonstrate that the type of directive is crucial in determining a president's strategic decision to use executive orders, in line with previous research, and that agency centralization is one crucial component of this strategic calculation. © 2018, Copyright © American University, Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies.",,,,,,,"U.S. Department of Defense; U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; U.S. Department of Justice; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; U.S. Department of Transportation; U.S. Department of Homeland Security; U.S. Department of Commerce; U.S. Department of State; U.S. Department of the Interior; U.S. Department of Labor; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; U.S. Social Security Administration; U.S. Department of the Treasury; California Department of Food and Agriculture; U.S. General Services Administration","Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., In the Web of Politics: Three Decades of the U.S. Federal Executive, , Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, and; Binder, S.A., Stalemate: Causes and Consequences of Legislative Gridlock, , Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press; Bolton, A., Thrower, S., Legislative Capacity and Executive Unilateralism American Journal of Political Science, 60 (3), pp. 649-663; Bruff, H.H., Presidential Power Meets Bureaucratic Expertise Journal of Constitutional Law, 12 (2), pp. 461-490; Randall, L., Mathew, D.M., Barry, R.W., A Theory of Political Control and Agency Discretion American Journal of Political Science, 33 (3), pp. 588-611; Daniel, P., Adaptive Signal Processing, Hierarchy, and Budgetary Control in Federal Regulation The American Political Science Review, 90 (2), pp. 283-302; Chiou, F.-Y., Rothenberg, L.S., The Elusive Search for Presidential Power American Journal of Political Science, 58 (3), pp. 653-668; Chiou, F.-Y., Rothenberg, L.S., The Enigma of Presidential Power: Parties, Policies and Strategic Uses of Unilateral Action, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, and; Clinton, J.D., Bertelli, A., Grose, C.R., Lewis, D.E., Nixon, D.C., Separated Powers in the United States: The Ideology of Agencies, Presidents, and Congress American Journal of Political Science, 56 (2), pp. 341-354; Clinton, J.D., Lewis, D.E., Expert Opinion, Agency Characteristics, and Agency Preferences Political Analysis, 16, pp. 3-20; Cooper, P.J., By Order of the President: The Use and Abuse of Executive Direct Action, , Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas; Deering, C.J., Maltzman, F., The Politics of Executive Orders: Legislative Constraints on Presidential Power Political Research Quarterly, 52 (4), pp. 767-783; Edwards, G.C., III, (2009) The Strategic President: Persuasion & Opportunity in Presidential Leadership, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Epstein, D., O'Halloran, S., Delegating Powers: A Transaction Cost Politics Approach to Policy Making under Separate Powers, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, and; Eshbaugh-Soha, M., The Impact of Presidential Speeches on the Bureaucracy Social Science Quarterly, 89 (1), pp. 116-132; Fine, J.A., Warber, A.L., Circumventing Adversity: Executive Orders and Divided Government Presidential Studies Quarterly, 42 (2), pp. 256-274; Gailmard, S., Multiple Principals and Oversight of Bureaucratic Policy-Making Journal of Theoretical Politics, 21 (2), pp. 161-186; Gleiber, D.W., Shull, S.A., Presidential Influence in the Policymaking Process The Western Political Quarterly, 45 (2), pp. 441-467; Golden, M.M., What Motivates Bureaucrats?

The conception of the neutral bureaucracy is closely linked to the notion of the prominent politics administration dichotomy of the two spheres of politics and administration, as advocated by Max Weber (1980) and Woodrow Wilson (1887). According to conventional wisdom, the firm and encompassing implementation of the merit principle realises the idea of a neutral bureaucracy. In that respect, neutrality and merit-based recruitments are often considered the opposite of politicisation. Conventionally, a neutral bureaucracy is considered to assure competence and immunity against opportunistic ideas brought in by volatile, sometimes erratic political leadership. Because elected politicians come and go with elections, they cannot ensure that political decisions are carried out based on the ‘best’ available knowledge. In that sense, bureaucrats are conceived as neutral, obedient servants that subordinate their behaviour to the will of political masters, to the law and the common good. However, there is no strict politics administration dichotomy in contemporary politico-administrative systems. Empirical findings from the late 1970s onwards demonstrated that bureaucrats are by no means as neutral and ‘apolitical’ as assumed, but rather remarkably involved in political processes. This chapter discusses the literature on neutral competence and presents an empirical analysis of Danish and British civil servants’ accounts of neutrality. This chapter concludes by suggesting the concept of competent neutrality and discussing implications for our understanding of bureaucratic neutrality. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Civil service; Comparative public administration; Competent neutrality; Neutrality; Politicisation; Politics-administration dichotomy",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., Civil servants and policymakers: Neutral or responsive competence (1994) Governance, 7, pp. 461-469; Aucoin, P., New political governance in Westminister systems: Impartial public administration and management performance at risk (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Campbell, C., Peters, G.P., The politics/administration dichotomy: Death or merely change?

Framing the issue in such a way means asking three fundamental questions: not only, as Gill poignantly does, what is welcome, but also where is welcome actually located and, most importantly, who welcomes. These questions illuminate the many overlooked forms of affective and physical labour without which state-centred, institutional, and internationally organized aid and ""welcome"" would not be possible. The task, I contend, is to unearth the labour of care that the governance of migration and refuge requires, labour that is mostly feminized, racialized, and precarious. By illuminating the forms of care and interdependencies upon which the reproduction of our societies depends - in all its aspects, including border regimes - this perspective opens up an emancipatory pathway to the politicization of welcoming and aid to migrants and refugees, alternative to humanitarian discourses. © 2018 by the author.","Care; Feminist geography; Labour; Refugees; Welcome","bureaucracy; civil society; governance approach; human geography; labor migration; migration; refugee; Greece; Italy; Jordan; Lebanon",,,,,,"Egeland, J., Harmer, A., Stoddard, A., (2011) To Stay and Deliver: Good Practice for Humanitarians in Complex Security Environments, , https://www.humanitarianoutcomes.org/publications/stay-and-deliver-good-practice-humanitarians-complex-security-environments, Policy Development and Studies Bureau, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), New York. 19.11.2018; Fluri, J., Lehr, R., (2017) The Carpetbaggers of Kabul and Other American-Afghan Entanglements: Intimate Development, Geopolitics and the Currency of Gender and Grief, , University of Georgia Press, Athens; Folbre, N., Who cares?

Using data from a large-scale executive survey from central government ministries and agencies in 18 European countries, the article provides a comprehensive cross-national and cross-organizational analysis of the autonomy-politicization conundrum and the drivers of the politicization of senior-level appointments. We find that national patterns of politicization correspond fairly well to country families as defined by administrative traditions, with some traditions being more coherent than others. At the organizational level, we find no evidence of efforts by politicians to compensate for extended autonomy by politicizing senior-level appointments, yet we provide evidence of differential effects of both formal and informal organizational characteristics on patterns of politicization. Our analyses show that politicization of senior appointments is lower in organizations with agency status, higher organizational social capital, higher financial autonomy and more extensive use of management tools. The article thereby not only offers comprehensive evidence of cross-country differences in politicization; it also adds to the literature on sub-national variation, by fleshing out an organizational perspective to the study of politicized appointments in the European context. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.","Agencies; patronage; political control; politicization; public sector reform; senior civil service",,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 266887",,,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,09520767,,,,"English","Public Policy Adm.",Article in Press,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047408289

In this Article, we argue that this deluge presents both challenges and opportunities, and we explore how advances in natural language processing technologies can help agencies address the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities created by the recent growth of public participation in the regulatory process. We also examine how scholars of public bureaucracies can use this important new publicly available data to better understand how agencies interact with the public. To illustrate the value of these new tools, we carry out computational text analysis of nearly three million public comments that were received by administrative agencies over the course of the Obama administration. Our findings indicate that advances in natural language processing technology show great promise for both researchers and policymakers who are interested in understanding, and improving, regulatory decision-making. © 2018 Michael A.

This article develops and tests the argument that this variation to some extent can be traced to the degree of bureaucratic politicization in a polity. A politicized bureaucracy offers politicians greater opportunities to demand from bureaucrats—and raises incentives for bureaucrats to supply—public policy knowledge that is strategically biased or suppressed in a manner that benefits incumbents reputationally. Due to electoral competition, we suggest that the link between bureaucratic politicization and politicized policy knowledge will be stronger in democracies than in autocracies. A case analysis of Argentina's statistical agency lends credence to the underlying causal mechanism. Time-series cross-sectional analyses confirm the broader validity of the expectations and show that the relationship is present only in democracies. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"0602-02208B; European Commission, EC: 290529; European Research Council, ERC: 339571; Vetenskapsrådet, VR: 2012–872; Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond, DFF","Aucoin, P., New political governance in Westminster systems: Impartial public administration and management performance at risk (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Beck, T., Clarke, G., Groff, A., Keefer, P., Walsh, P., New tools in comparative political economy: The database of political institutions (2001) The World Bank Economic Review, 15 (1), pp. 165-176; Berliner, D., The political origins of transparency (2014) Journal of Politics, 76 (2), pp. 479-491; Berliner, D., Erlich, A., Competing for transparency: Political competition and institutional reform in Mexican states (2015) American Political Science Review, 109 (1), pp. 110-128; Bersch, K., Praça, S., Taylor, M., State capacity, bureaucratic politicization, and corruption in the Brazilian state (2017) Governance, 30 (1), pp. 105-124; Boix, C., Miller, M., Rosato, S., A complete data set of political regimes, 1800–2007 (2013) Comparative Political Studies, 46 (12), pp. 1523-1554; Boston, J., Nethercote, J.R., Reflections on “New Political Governance in Westminster Systems (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 201-205; Cingolani, L., Thomsson, K., de Crombrugghe, D., Minding Weber more than ever?

It was designed as the final step of the two-decade-long effort to restructure the “1955 System,” that is, the politico-administrative system developed under the Liberal Democratic Party’s hegemony. Its purpose was to remold Japan’s independent-minded bureaucrats into the elected officials’ obedient servants. Unfortunately, the reform is unlikely to deliver expected results. The failure’s major reason concerns the fact that Japanese bureaucracy’s unusually large role in policymaking paradoxically discourages elected officials to use their major reining tool against it, namely, appointive power. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bureaucratic autonomy; civil service reform; Japan; politicization; senior civil service",,,,,,,"Aoki, M., (1988) Information, incentives, and bargaining in the Japanese economy, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Boyd, R., The making of state-bureaucracy relations in Japan (2006) State making in Asia, pp. 53-90. , Boyd R., Ngo T., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge,.

Citizen distrust in government and its institutions considerably affects the effectiveness and efficiency of public policies and their implementation. Since the independence, Sri Lanka has been regarded as a third world democracy with a strong welfare state system in which public institutions have played pivotal role in fostering democracy and citizen trust. Nevertheless, in the recent past, citizen trust in most public institutions has been alarmingly decreasing owing to politicization of public sector, service delivery, political and bureaucratic corruption, lack of transparency, accountability, ethnic prejudice and partiality in the working of the public institutions. In this backdrop, this paper examines the level of citizen trust in selected institutions and explores factors that influence on trust. The study adopted mixed method approach to explore the problem phenomenon. The study finds that ethnic majority has more trust in public institutions than that of minority, and identity, language of administration and lack of equal representation in bureaucracy are also considerably determine level of trust citizens have in public institutions. Further, political patronage in service delivery has subverted quality of public institutions and trust, interestingly, citizens those who support and being affiliated with ruling party tend to have more trust in government.

Some of us are told we live in a ""cancer cluster""-an area with a disproportionate number of cancer deaths. During the summer months, those who live in or near urban areas are bombarded with daily smog measurements and air pollution alerts. City water supplies are frequently called health hazards. At times, it seems as though virtually everything we eat and drink is denounced as bad for us by some ""public health expert."" Our cars burn too much gasoline; we own too many firearms; we are too fat; some of us are too skinny. Americans today are living longer than they ever have before. Why the almost daily announcements of new public health threats and proclamations of impending crises? Bennett and DiLorenzo address this question and others here. They begin by examining the large public health bureaucracy, its preoccupation with expanding governmental programs, and its concern with political issues that too often have little to do with improving public health. Then they trace the evolution of the American public health movement from its founding after the Civil War to the 1950s. They describe the transformation of public health's focus from the eradication of disease to social policy as a by-product of the 1960s. Bennett and DiLorenzo catalogue the ""radicalization"" of the public health movement by discussing its numerous political initiatives. They include case studies of the politicization of the public health movement in America. The authors reveal various methods of statistical manipulation that certain public health researchers use to ""cook the data"" in order to achieve politically correct results. A final chapter discusses the implications of the transformation of public health from pathology to politics. This vigorously argued analysis sees the public health movement as claiming expertise on virtually every social issue, from poverty to human rights. Students of public policy and public health officials, along with readers interested in public health issues, will find this absorbing reading. © 2000 by Taylor & Francis.

Existing explanations of mission creep assume that IOs act autonomously and expand in those areas that connect with their mandates, sense of organizational mission, and sphere of expert authority. The claim here is that entrepreneurial bureaucrats can succeed-in the absence of policy deadlock among states-in creating creep in unexpected issue domains through the mobilization of external expertise. The article examines this dynamic in the domain of bioethical standards. It shows that UNESCO acted as a first mover in the field, despite having no relevant expertise, and despite bioethics being more closely connected to the mandate of other organizations. Entrepreneurial bureaucrats within UNESCO were able to create creep in bioethics by mobilizing external experts in the field and capturing their skills. Working with external experts endowed their organization with the capacity to act, gave epistemic authority to their actions, and prevented the politicization of debates in a potentially controversial issue domain. In pointing to the strategic uses of expertise, the article challenges the commonly held view that expert knowledge acts as a means of solving problems and rationalizing global governance. © The Author (2017).

The current paper aims to understand this empirical puzzle by exploring whether the ‘relatively sound’ management of public investment can be explained by the characteristics of the central economic bureaucracy. It draws on process-tracing analysis and in-depth elite interviews. In line with the developmental state literature, the analysis argues that authoritative and insulated public administrations are essential for policy effectiveness, particularly in institutional contexts prone to a high politicisation of the public purse. Yet, in order to prevent bureaucratic capture, bureaus must also be accountable. The analysis in particular shows how increasing the transparency of the state and allowing a stronger oversight of policy performance by the public and the media are extremely important. Conversely, transformations which simply reduce the powers of strong, top-down bureaucracies to increase the indiscriminate control by governments – such as the ones which have occurred in Turkey in recent years – will not lead to stronger institutions, but merely produce different ineffective and unsustainable structures. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Bureaucracies; bureaucratic accountability; bureaucratic insulation; state capacity; Turkey",,,,,,,"Amsden, A., (1989) Asia’s Next Giant: South Korea and Late Industrialisation, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Ashworth, R., Snape, S., Aulakh, S., Plugging the accountability gap?

Public scepticism is often directed at the European Commission which is accused of being an unresponsive and illegitimate bureaucracy. How does politicization affect the institutional role conceptions of Commission officials? By building on the literature of politicization and norm-guided open system approaches, I develop theoretical propositions on how politicization may affect the institutional role conceptions of Commission officials. Grounded on the proposition that Commission officials are most likely to respond to politicization in their home country, an exploratory case study of Dutch officials (21 in-depth interviews) was performed to flesh out the mechanisms at play. The findings tentatively reveal that, in varying degrees, most officials respond to politicization by adapting their institutional role conception into a more pragmatic direction, in which subsidiarity or legitimacy concerns are central. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Commission officials' attitudes; European Commission; open system theory; politicization",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Aggestam, L., Role theory and European foreign policy (2006) The European Union's Roles in International Politics Concepts and Analysis, , O.

Using a comparative case design, this article investigates this claim by studying the roles of ministerial advisers in government coordination in Denmark and Sweden. The article demonstrates how the roles of advisers differ in coordination: Swedish advisers directly control government coordination through hierarchical authority. The roles of advisers and bureaucrats are functionally differentiated in coordination. In contrast, Danish advisers play a more indirect role in coordination. Rather than controlling coordination, they serve to reproduce the functional politicization of the permanent bureaucracy in government coordination. The findings underline the relevance of including advisers in the future study of government coordination.

Firstly, this chapter looks at the definitions of corruption, its unpredictability, and different forms of petty and grand corruption after the Rose-Ackerman (2008) model. Corruption's long-lasting effects on poverty are also mentioned. This chapter suggests that corporate governance institutions and their good practice may alleviate the effects of corruption. Corporate governance reforms are described and suggestions are made on how their good practice may strengthen government institutions and promote business investment in countries with weak markets. Finally, this chapter states that institutional-building is an important part of combating corruption, preventing politicization in the organs of government, and promoting socioeconomic well-being in the region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a small but growing body of research into bureaucracies’ responses to mediatisation from within which have identified tensions between bureaucratic and party political values, but this has not included the United Kingdom. There are concerns that the traditional dividing line between government information and political propaganda has come under increasing pressure as a higher premium is placed on persuasion by both journalists and politicians battling for public attention in an increasingly competitive market. Within Whitehall, the arrival of Labour in 1997 after 18 years in opposition was a watershed for UK government communications, allowing the government to reconfigure its official information service in line with the party political imperative to deploy strategic communications as a defence against increasingly invasive media scrutiny. Public relations, in government as elsewhere, has grown in scale, scope and status, becoming institutionalised and normalised within state bureaucracies, but how has this affected the role, status and influence of the civil servants who conduct media management? Within the system of executive self-regulation of government publicity that is characteristic of Whitehall, government press officers must negotiate a difficult path between the need to inform citizens about the government’s programme, and demands by ministers to deploy privileged information to secure and maintain personal and party advantage in the struggle for power. Taking 1997 as a turning point, and through the voices of the actors who negotiate government news – mainly press officers, but also journalists and special advisers – this article examines the changing role and position of Whitehall press officers in what has become known as the age of political spin, finding that profound and lasting change in the rules of engagement has taken place and is continuing. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","government; mediatisation; political spin; public relations; United Kingdom",,,,,,,"Atkinson, J., Metaspin: Demonisation of media manipulation (2005) Political Science, 57, pp. 17-27; Bale, T., Sanders, K., ‘Playing by the book’: Success and failure in John Major’s approach to prime ministerial media management (2001) Contemporary British History, 15, pp. 93-110; Blair, T., (2010) A Journey, , London, Hutchinson Publishing; Blick, A., Jones, G.W., (2013) At Power’s Elbow, , London, Biteback Publishing; Blumenthal, S., (1982) The Permanent Campaign: Inside the World of Elite Political Operatives, , New York, Simon & Schuster; Butler, L., (2004) Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction: Implementation of Its Conclusions, , London, HMSO; (2012) Special Adviser Data Releases: Numbers and Costs, , London, Cabinet Office, 2015; (2015) Code of Conduct for Special Advisers, , London, Cabinet Office; Campbell, A., Hagerty, B., (2011) The Alastair Campbell Diaries: Volume 2, , London, Hutchinson Publishing; Chilcot, S.J., (2016) The Report of the Iraq Inquiry, , London, House of Commons; Cook, T.E., (1998) Governing with the News, , Chicago, IL, The University of Chicago Press; Davis, A., (2013) Promotional Cultures: The Rise and Spread of Advertising, Public Relations, Marketing and Branding, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Dinan, W., Miller, D., (2007) Thinker, Faker, Spinner, Spy: Corporate PR and the Assault on Democracy, , London, Pluto Press; Edwards, L., Public relations and society: A Bourdieuvian perspective (2011) Public Relations, Society & Culture: Theoretical and Empirical Explorations, pp. 61-74. , Edwards, Hodges, (eds), Abion, Routledge,.

Consequently, ALM reforms may give raise to social unrest and political struggle that involves the state (the main proponent of ALM reforms), trade unions and political parties. These conflicts are important in the politicization of reforms, i.e. raising public awareness of and engagement with controversies of welfare state change. In this article, we use a non-European perspective to ask more generally how distinct historical institutions create separate ‘politicization trajectories’ of ALM reforms, which in turn produce different policy designs and outcomes. Centring on the case of Israel, in which historically ‘abnormal’ class politics fostered indifference to the reform in both trade unions and political parties, we maintain that the preliminary de-politicization made it possible for bureaucrats to control the reform, leading to an intra-state conflict between competing agencies over its design and implementation. The usurpation of the reform by the Ministry of Finance made it conspicuously unbalanced, provoking many grievances. Paradoxically, the de-politicization of the reform advanced its re-politicization, led by non-governmental advocacy organizations in civil society. These uncommon political actors in the politics of ALM reforms were able to lead a counter-coalition, delegitimize the reform, and mobilize politicians to eventually terminate activation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Active labour market policy; Bureaucratic politics in the welfare state; Israel; Welfare state transformation; Workfare","labor market; labor policy; party politics; political reform; trade union; welfare economics; Israel",,,,,,"(2009) Interview with A.H.

Based upon extensive ethnographic fieldwork in Karnataka State, I examine the life history of the Gates-funded AIDS initiative in India known as Avahan as a case study to consider the social and political implications of large-scale, standardizing knowledge regimes enacted in the era of global health. Specifically, I analyze a sample of the key material artifacts that are implicated in the production of standardized knowledge in an attempt to illuminate the workings of what I refer to as ‘evidentiary sovereignty’. I argue that documents, forms, and other paperwork used to generate evidence in global health interventions neither merely reflect expert knowledge nor convey information about scientific standards but, rather, are integral to the re-instantiation of sovereignty. The effects of evidentiary sovereignty not only narrow the aperture of global health interventions to overlook the on-the-ground realities that shape health problems, but they also transform the very ground upon which communities responding to HIV epidemics conceive of and enact politics.

In this article we take a novel step by looking at two possible consequences of increased political recruitment for the policy process: administrative politicization and contestability. We deploy a Most Similar Systems comparison of Denmark and Sweden and include survey answers from 657 civil servants in managerial positions. We find that political recruitment of top civil servants, such as Swedish state secretaries, restricts the access of the civil service to the minister, but it does not substantially politicize the policy process. Danish civil servants perceive themselves as more contested by the relatively few Danish political advisers than their Swedish colleagues. Our results imply that the organization of political advice is a crucial factor for politicization and contestability. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"administrative framework; empirical analysis; party politics; political organization; survey; Denmark; Sweden",,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., Civil Servants and Policymakers: Neutral or Responsive Competence?

In a world of seemingly inevitable widespread congressional delegation to administrative agencies, as well as the Supreme Court’s blessing of independent agencies, how exactly is the fourth branch of government to be controlled? The canonical answer in administrative law, constitutional law, and political science, is agency design. By carefully selecting structural features of administrative agencies and requiring the use of specific decision-making procedures for policymaking, the legislature and the executive can ensure responsive and accountable bureaucracy-or so the argument goes. As Congress continues to create ever more agencies using ever more variations in institutional structure, and as the Supreme Court continues to grapple with which features of administrative are constitutional, the stakes of these conceptual debates have risen steadily. Indeed, we are in the midst of something of an agency design renaissance-a time period of fundamental change with respect to the federal bureaucracy-deriving mainly, although not exclusively, from the emergence of new administrative forms. Unfortunately, there is virtually no empirical scholarship that demonstrates a link between agency design and political responsiveness or agency behavior. This is due not to a lack of attention but to a fundamental problem of research design and the institutional landscape of administrative agencies. To address this question, scholars have studied individual agencies to document political influence exerted by Congress or the president in a specific policy domain. Such studies of individual agencies are important, but also analytically incapable of identifying the role of agency design in political responsiveness for two reasons. First, the relevant institutional features almost never vary within a single agency. Second, most policy outputs-where one would look to see evidence of political control-are not readily comparable across agencies. As a consequence, there has been little quantitative scholarship that establishes a link between agency design and a similar agency output across agencies or over time. This Essay focuses on an activity common to and comparable across many agencies-the distribution of federal moneys-to answer one of the most basic questions for agency design. We show that a prominent structural feature of agency design- the extent of high-level personnel politicization-affects the degree of political responsiveness by agencies. © 2017, Yale Law Journal.

Using the period 1986 to 2010 as a case study, the study unpacks the Philippine civil service to reveal the location and scale of political appointees in the bureaucracy, describes common techniques used by presidents to increase the number and penetration of appointees, and provides a quantitative evaluation of effects. Of specific interest is the thesis from Lewis that while political appointees in the bureaucracy can be a short term strategy for improving performance, the long term consequences are “pernicious” even when appointees are of consistently high quality. The available data permits only the simplest of regressions but results indicate that political appointees may indeed help in the short term but ultimately cause harm in the longer run. © 2017 Philippine Political Science Association (PPSA).","bureaucracy; civil service; government performance; political appointees; Politicization",,,,,,,"(1994) CES Occupancy Statistics Report, , and, CESB, Quezon City:; Cariño, L.V., (1990) An Assessment of Public Administration in the Philippines, 1986-1988, , PIDS Working Paper Series, No. 90-03, Quezon City: Philippine Institute for Development Studies; (1996) Inventory of Government Personnel, , and, CSC: Quezon City; Constantino-David, K., Buensalida, R.D.G., (2010) Presidential Powers and Prerogatives. a Study on How the Powers are Abused, , Manuscript and presentation at INCITEGov Forum on the Powers of the Presidency: Preventing Misuse and Abuse, Asian Institute of Management:; Budget Utilization by Agency 1992 to 2007, , personal correspondence; (1996) Staffing Summary, , and, DBM, Manila:; (2007) National Expenditure Program, , and, DBM, Manila:; (2012) Number of Authorized Positions in the National Government by Department, Selected Years, , personal correspondence; Evans, P., Rauch, J.E., Bureaucracy and Growth: A Cross-National Analysis of the Effects of “Weberian” State Structures on Economic Growth (1999) American Sociological Review, 64 (5), pp. 748-765. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/2657374; Habito, C.F., Missing Ramos-Style Governance (November 9, 2010) (2012) No Free Lunch.

In exploring the research on personnel reform in the US, one must start with the question of what is wrong with civil service that requires fundamental reform. The modern civil service system, designed to combat challenges surrounding the politicization of public service employment and the associated inefficiencies, has been argued to suffer from numerous dysfunctions requiring the continued attention of reformers. The fact that so many governors appear to be waging war with their career civil servants is troubling enough, but the extent to which many appear to be winning the battle is particularly worrisome. The trends that have just been discussed are fueled in part by the election of activist governors in at least 20 states. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Bowman, J.S., Gertz, M.G., Gertz, S.C., Williams, R.L., Civil service reform in Florida state government: Employee attitudes 1 year later (2003) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 23, p. 286; Coggburn, J., The effects of deregulation on state government personnel administration (2000) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 20, p. 24; Coggburn, J., Personnel deregulation: Exploring differences in the American states (2001) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 11, p. 223; Goodsell, C., (1994) The Case for Bureaucracy, , Chatham House, Chatham, NJ; Gossett, C., Civil service reform: The case of Georgia (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22, p. 94; Hays, S.W., Employee discipline and removal: Coping with job security, in Public Personnel Administration: Problems and Prospects (1995) Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, , Hays, S.

More recently, scholars have turned this idea on its head by stressing the importance of memories of the Revolt in legitimating dynastic power as well as denigrating enemies around 1600. References to the conflict were often euphemistic, implicit and devoid of detailed discussions of events. Later in the seventeenth century, however, Southern propagandists publically deployed explicit references to the Revolt in political discussions. Asking how and why this shift occurred, this article shows that the (international) political context strongly influenced cultural memory politics in the Habsburg Netherlands. Count Henry van den Bergh's political use of war memories in opposition to the Habsburg overlord in 1632 prompted a reaction in kind from government officials, who deployed public references to the sixteenth-century rebellion more explicitly than ever before and thereby set a new standard for using historical narratives about the Revolt in support of the regime. Indeed, the politicisation of the Revolt in 1632 enabled political commentators during renewed Franco-Dutch military threats in 1635 and the War of Devolution in 1667-1668 to refer to the Revolt not as a painful memory but as a positive argument in favour of Habsburg rule. © 2017 The Author(s).","Conspiracy of the nobility (1632); Franco-Spanish War (1635-1659); Memory politics; Revolt of the Netherlands; War of Devolution (1667-1668)",,,,,,,"Afbeeldinghe van den courtoisen Franschen ende ghenadighen broeders-aert.

By means of a content analysis of the news stories published by three Czech online news portals, this study examines the extent to which images of a threat and an appeal for security were part of the media coverage of the European migration crisis. While only small differences in extent were observed among the three portals, the findings suggest that the crisis was depicted mainly in terms of governance, i.e. as a burden to the state or as a security threat. All three news portals gave prominence to qualities like urgency, extraordinariness, overload and insecurity, and attributed these qualities to the figure of an indefinite wave of migrants heading to Europe. The humanitarian dimension of the reported events was marginalised. The findings indicate a striking dependence on institutional sources, mainly government officials. Almost exclusive salience was given to the governmental agenda. Authorship of every other news story was assigned to the Czech Press Agency. Aforementioned partial characteristics of the coverage resulted in highly politicized image of the crisis, which to considerable extent was presented as a security threat.","Agenda building; European migration crisis; Irregular migration; Online news; Securitization; Threat construction",,,,,,,"Alvares, C., Dahlgren, P., Populism, Extremism and Media: Mapping an Uncertain Terrain (2016) European Journal of Communication, 31 (1), pp. 46-57; Armáda v prípade náporu uprchlíku pošle na hranice až 2 600 vojáku, , http://zpravy.idnes.cz/armada-je-pripravena-na-uprchliky-na-hranice-muze-jit-az-2600-vojaku-pyn-/domaci.aspx?c=A150812_123843_domaci_fer, [2017-10-02]; Balzacq, T., A Theory of Securitization: Origins, Core Assumptions, and Variants (2011) Securitization Theory How Security Problems Emerge and Dissolve, pp. 1-30. , BALZACQ, T.

The modern democratic states are built upon the bureaucratic structure that undergrid these states, although there is a vast difference in bureaucratic traditions and cultures in between developed and developing democratic and democratizing societies. As a developing region, South Asia has a longstanding tradition of bureaucratic organization. The traditional bureaucracies were “patrimonial” in nature, where loyalty was valued more than professionalism. However, the replacement of the concept of modern “rational-legal” bureaucracy in traditional societies like South Asia was initiated by the colonial master rulers or imperial powers following the conceptualization of modern bureaucracy by Max Weber. Their (colonial rulers) intention was to establish a “steel frame” of administration in South Asia so that their hegemony remains intact even after the breakdown of colonial hegemony. Studies of democratic politics in India, the military dominated authoritarian state of Pakistan and the newly democratic state of Bangladesh have addressed this heavily in the literature of politics and administration, but far less explained the process of governance, particularly explaining the politicization of the bureaucracy in South Asia. The role of bureaucracy in governance is not a new phenomenon in the discourse of politics and administration. Irrespective of the regions and the systems of government, professional mandarins or bureaucracies (rational-legal, neutral and merit-based) are exceedingly involved in the process of governance and development, and immensely contribute to the development by serving as advisers, inventors, and decision-makers along with the elected politicians as the agent of change. Thus, a study has been carried out on the politics-bureaucracy relationship and the role of bureaucracy in governance. Yet, academics are interested to understand the nature of the relationship between politics and bureaucracy, their transition, and their mutual interaction in politics from different perspectives and academic point of view with intellectual inquiry. This monograph is with the South Asian bureaucracy, focusing on the light of politicization. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,,,,,,"Abedin, N., (1973) Local Administration and Politics in Modernizing Societies: Bangladesh and Pakistan, , Dhaka: National Institute of Public Administration; Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., Mandates or Mandarins?

The interest arises from the tension between politicians ideal behavior -according to universal and publicly orientated rules - and an actual practice that supposes taking into account the interests of individual citizens and certain social groups, as well as the own political interests. The relation between impersonality and public interest is questioned, arguing that personalized distribution of public goods does not suppose necessarily its private appropriation. The article presents an empirical study of the daily activity of politicians with different positions in elective office, all of them belonging to the governing party, in the province of Santiago del Estero, where the political regime has been recognized by the importance of personal relations and bureaucracy politicization. Following a qualitative methodological strategy - that includes the techniques of in-depth interviews and non-participant observation-; the article presents empirical evidence on politicians daily activity and their notions about their practices; paying attention to their connections with the citizens and with other politicians and civil servants. The article shows that the activities of provincial politicians involve personalized contact with the citizens, as well as with civil servants of different levels of the public administration; which allow them facilitate the distribution of public goods to their electoral base; activities which are mainly informal. Although their actions benefit individual citizens and certain territorial groups -far from of the abstract notion of citizenship-, this does not exclude common good promotion. The leaders can also obtain a personal political benefit, different from their ""private"" interest, since it necessarily supposes favouring other citizens or groups of citizens. The article puts in question the canonical relation between impersonality and public interest -present in academic literature-, specifying the distinction between personal political links and privatization; even suggesting a complementary relation among particularistic practices and the universality expected from political representatives.","Common good; Daily political activity; Informal institutions; Political representation; State",,,,,,"Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social; Ministerio de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural; Universidad de Buenos Aires","Abélès, M., (2001) Un ethnologue à l'Assemblée, , París: Odile Jacob; Annunziata, R., 'Proximidad', representación y participación El Presupuesto Participativo en Argentina (2011) íconos, 15 (40), pp. 57-70; Annunziata, R., Ciudadanía disminuida: la idea de la 'construcción de ciudadanía' en los dispositivos participativos contemporáneos (2015) Temas y Debates, 30 (19), pp. 39-57; Auyero, J., (1997) ¿Favores por votos?

I argue that the higher the cost of managing the coalition, the greater the likelihood of the centralization of public bodies in the Presidency. The study analyzes 172 bodies created by the Brazilian federal public administration from 1990 to 2009, with individual bodies serving as the unit of analysis. With the aim of gauging the extent to which centralization shapes the Presidency, my binary dependent variable is whether a body created within the hierarchy of the Presidency or reallocated from the ministries to the Presidency. In order to assess the effects of the degree of conflicts among the coalition’s preferences on the probability of presidential centralization, four binary logistic regressionmodels were estimated, with the degree of ideological dispersion in the cabinet; the degree of politicization in the coalition; the degree of party fractionalization in the cabinet, and the degree of ideological extremism analyzed as key factors to the study. © 2017, Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Politicos (IESP), UERJ.

Moreover, key agents of global governance-international organisations and their bureaucracies, non-state actors and private agents-exercise pervasive forms of authority. Due to these shifts, it is widely noted that world politics suffers from a democratic deficit. This article contributes to work on global democracy by looking at the role of international courts. Building upon an original dataset covering the 24 international courts in existence since the end of the Second World War, we argue that international courts are able to advance democratic values and shape democratic practices beyond the state. They can do so by fostering equal participation, accountability, and public justification that link individuals directly with sites of transnational authority. We contend that the ability of international courts to promote these values is conditioned by institutional design choices concerning access rules, review powers, and provisions regarding judicial reason-giving. We canvass these design features of different international courts and assess the promises and pitfalls for global democratisation.

Yet national-level measures neglect large differences within countries. This article therefore takes the perspective of individual bureaucrats. It studies how public officials' experience with bureaucratic institutions affects corruption within their sphere of work. Based on a survey of central government officials in five post-communist states, the article examines how public servants' views on civil service laws, the quality of their implementation, merit recruitment, and the politicization of appointments associate with rumours of kickbacks in their place of work. The analysis shows that merit recruitment is associated with less corruption, while politicization is associated with more corruption. In contrast, civil service laws are negatively associated with corruption only if they are properly implemented.

Basel (Bâle, Basilea, Basle) has been identified as a ‘relatively successful’ practitioner of sustainable mobility, with an urban form that is not only conducive to walking and cycling, but also has an extensive public transport system and high levels of commuting using these sustainable modes of transport. With a low share of journeys by motor vehicles compared to many other European cities – combined with a legally-binding objective to reduce vehicle traffic by a further 10% from 2010 to 2020 – Basel appears to be a forerunner with regard to sustainable mobility policy and practice. Five years after this objective was passed into law – following a public vote, as Basel is part of the Swiss confederation and practices direct democracy – this study aims to assess the extent of policy implementation and reflect on challenges and opportunities for the future. The paper presents findings from a series of interviews with stakeholders in Basel on the theme of sustainable mobility. Key questions include: is it possible to develop coherent strategies and policies to further reduce the role of motor vehicles and in doing so, achieve a modal shift? How does participation in a direct democracy influence strategy and policy development and outcomes? Do compromises and trade-offs mean strategies and policies promoting sustainable mobility are, like Swiss cheese, riddled with holes? By illustrating challenges and opportunities when advancing sustainable mobility in a participative culture, the study provides insights for policymakers and researchers in other contexts. Among the conclusions is an emphasis on the importance of committed individuals capable of expanding the ‘strategy space’ of processes. Participation provides one such opportunity, yet may also generate divergent or contradictory trends causing incrementalism. A rapid transition to sustainable mobility is thus likely to require increased politicisation of the topic by both politicians and civil servants. © 2016 The Author.

The article asks whether political appointees accentuate or blur the line between politics and administration. Do political appointees take over political-tactical advice and leave policy advice to the permanent civil service, or do they cause permanent civil servants to be even more influenced by political considerations? And do political appointees make it easier or more difficult for the permanent civil service to be politically responsive? A Most Similar Systems Design comparison of Denmark and Sweden allows an assessment of the effects of political appointees. It is found that a large number of political appointees decreases functional politicisation of the permanent civil service; that functional politicisation tends to crowd out tasks related to more classic policy advice; and that functional politicisation increases political responsiveness. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Denmark; Political advisers; political appointees; politicisation; Sweden","administration; civil service; comparative study; political organization; politics; Denmark; Sweden",,,,,,"Aberbach, J., Rockman, B.D., Civil Servants and Policymakers: Neutral or Responsive Competence?

This is particularly the case in developing countries, where poor quality regulation is a challenge. As a developing country, Turkey has some regulatory institutions in certain sectors, but these are somewhat weak and subject to historical concerns with an over-powerful bureaucracy, politicisation and executive influence, and dynamics that create rather than curtail rent-seeking behaviours. Therefore, it might be useful to discuss the possibility of better regulation using a new regulatory perspective. For this purpose, evaluation through a RIA is advised. Here, information about the history and development of regulatory institutions presently operating in Turkey is provided, along with discussion of a new regulatory perspective. © 2016 Peter Lang GmbH.

It applies a delegation theory and a Public Service Bargain perspective and argues that partisan and professional determinants influence the bureaucratic tenure. Our survival analysis shows that partisan features matter, yet differently than suggested by existing research: top officials affiliated with the minister's party have a significant higher risk of dismissal than those affiliated to other parties and non-partisans. In contrast, the temporal proximity between ministerial and top official appointments has no significant effects on bureaucratic tenure. In addition, professional determinants shape bureaucratic survival. Whereas the minister's office experience is insignificant for bureaucratic survival, the top official's office experience has significant and negative effects on the risk of dismissal: individuals with prior experience in managing bureaucratic apparatuses survive longer than those without such office experience. We conclude that German ministers are more likely to dismiss senior civil servants due to their unsatisfying office experience than their incongruent or lacking partisan affiliation. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","bureaucratic tenure; civil service; Germany; patronage; politicisation; survival analysis",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Harvard University Press Cambridge; Andeweg, R., Collegiality and collectivity: Cabinets, cabinet committees and cabinet ministers (1997) The Hollow Crown: Countervailing Trends in Core Executives, pp. 58-83. , Weller H.

Using data on the party affiliation of 134 secretaries-general (SGs) serving in the Dutch ministerial bureaucracy between 1945 and 2013, it examines the partisan logic of appointment patterns among senior civil servants in the Netherlands. Overall levels of politicization are very high (almost 70 percent of all SGs have a discernible party affiliation), with a strong increase between 1970 and 1990 and a slight drop-off during the past decades. The appointment patterns suggest that the main drivers behind the party politicization of the Dutch elite bureaucracy are the demand for ideological agreement and a consociational quest for the representation of the 'pillar parties' in the senior civil service. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","administrative elites; bureaucracy; civil service; Netherlands; politicization",,,,,,"Austrian Science Fund, FWF: 3409-G11","Bäck, H., Debus, M., Dumont, P., Who gets what in coalition governments?

This study sets out to investigate the appointment of ministerial advisers from an historical institutionalist perspective emphasizing the influence of institutional legacies on current empirical patterns. Drawing on this perspective, it identifies three patterns of institutional stability, radical, and gradual change in terms of ministerial advisers' policy competence and political loyalty, which guide the empirical analysis. Empirical patterns are illustrated with data collected in Italy, based on an analysis of a combination of career pathways and expert interviews. The Italian case is noteworthy since it experienced an abrupt party system breakdown in the early 1990s. Yet, the empirical analysis reveals that the massive re-alignment of the party system has not implied a pattern of radical change in Italy. The legacy of stable administrative structures has only left room for gradual change to occur on the dimensions of ministerial advisers' policy competence and political loyalty. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","civil service reform; Italy; ministerial cabinets; patronage; politicization",,,,,,,"Agosta, A., Piccardi, C., I gabinetti ministeriali (1988) Le Relazioni Tra Amministrazioni e Partiti, pp. 73-145. , A.

Whereas ‘ability signalling’ displays bureaucratic expertise in the sense of both political craft and administrative management competencies, ‘intention signalling’ indicates party politicization. Data are drawn from the biographies of 341 civil servants within the two highest ranks in federal ministries and the chancellery who held office between 2002 and 2013. Taking gender, formal education and career patterns into consideration, we are able to find clear evidence for ‘intention signalling’, whereas ‘ability signalling’ plays only a minor role. Over time, the accelerating effect of ‘intention signalling’ on administrative careers is increasing. Points for practitioners: How important is political loyalty for senior civil servants in merit bureaucracies? This article investigates the relationship between the merit principle and politicization in the German federal bureaucracy. By analysing the importance of certain career steps, we find clear evidence for party politicization. Employment in positions that signal party political loyalty accelerates the careers of ministerial officials, even if the data also prove that there is no distinct ‘fast track’ to leading administrative positions in Germany. Moreover, our analysis reveals an under-representation of women in administrative top positions, as well as the continuing dominance of lawyers. Regarding career patterns, considerable differences between state secretaries and directors-general are evident. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","ability signalling; intention signalling; ministerial bureaucracy; party politicization; state secretaries","bureaucracy; civil service; party politics; public administration; Germany",,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., The US federal executive in an era of change (2013) Governance, 16 (3), pp. 373-399; Bauer, M.W., Ege, J., Politicization within the European Commission’s bureaucracy (2012) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 78 (3), pp. 403-424; Bernhard, D., Strategic promotion and compensation (1995) Review of Economic Studies, 62 (2), pp. 315-339; Bodiguel, J.-L., The political control of civil servants in Europe: Some aspects (1986) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 52, pp. 187-200; Carroll, B.W., Bureaucratic élites: Some patterns in career paths over time (1996) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 62, pp. 383-399; Christensen, J.G., Klemmensen, R., Opstrup, N., Politicitization and the replacement of top civil servants in denmark (2014) Governance, 27 (2), pp. 215-241; Connelly, B., Certo, S.T., Ireland, R.D., Reutzel, C.R., Signaling theory: A review and assessment (2011) Journal of Management, 37 (1), pp. 39-67; Dahlström, C., Lapuente, V., Explaining cross-country differences in performance-related pay in the public sector (2013) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 20 (3), pp. 577-600; Dahlström, C., Niklasson, B., The politics of politicization in Sweden (2013) Public Administration, 91 (4), pp. 891-907; Dargie, C., Locke, R., The British senior civil service (1999) Bureaucratic Elites in Western European States: A Comparative Analysis of Top Officials in Eleven Countries, pp. 178-204. , Oxford: Oxford University Press,,.

Based upon an argument that the involvement in strategic communication is to be seen as part and parcel of a functional politicization of the civil service, the article identifies a significant and positive relationship between media awareness and functional politicization across the ministerial hierarchy as well as between media pressure and functional politicization, although moderated by organizational level and position. Based upon these empirical findings, the article demonstrates how strategic communication for pursuing and achieving political ends in central governments involves a permanent civil service aware of and positioned in organizations subject to pressures from the news media. The article discusses how these findings relate to different perspectives on strategic communication in central government organizations and identifies the need for mediatization research to re-emphasize central government organizations as organizations in their own right but just as importantly as an instrument for governments. Furthermore, the article points out the relevance for including non-elected actors into the research on political communication from politicians once elected into offices. The empirical analysis is performed in the context of Danish central government organizations. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,"Allison, G.T., (1971) Essence of decision, , Boston, MA: Little Brown; Andersen, L.B., Binderkrantz, A.S., Hansen, K.M., Forskningsdesign (2012) Metoder i Statskundskab, , Andersen L.B., Hansen K.M., Klemmesen R., (eds), Copenhagen, Denmark: Hans Reitzels Forlag; Aucoin, P., New political governance in Westminister systems: Impartial public administration and mangement performance at risk (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Bertelli, A.M., Sinclair, A., Lee, H., Media attention and the demise of agency independence: Evidence from a mass administrative reorganization in Britain (2015) Public Administration, 93 (4), pp. 1168-1183; Embedsmanden i det moderne folkestyre (2015) Bo Smith-udvalgets rapport om samspillet mellem politikere og embedsmænd, , Copenhagen, Denmark: DJØF Publishing; Canel, M.J., Sanders, K., Introduction: Mapping the field of government communication (2013) Government communication: Cases and challenges, , Sanders K., Canel M.J., (eds), London, UK: Bloomsbury; Deacon, D., Monk, W., Quangos and the communications dependent society (2001) European Journal of Communication, 16 (1), pp. 25-49; Dixit, A., Incentives and organizations in the public sector: An interpretative review (2002) The Journal of Human Resources, 37, pp. 696-727; Egeberg, M., How bureaucratic structure matters: An organizational perspective (2003) Handbook of public administration, , Peters G.B., Pierre J., (eds), London, UK: Sage; Eichbaum, C., Shaw, R., (2010) Partisan appointees and public servants: An international analysis of the role of the political adviser, , Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar; Esser, F., Strömbäck, J., (2014) Mediatization of politics: Understanding the transformation of Western democracies, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Esser, F., Strömbäck, J., Conclusion (2014) Mediatization of politics: Understanding the transformation of Western democracies, , Esser F., Strömbäck J., (eds), Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Frandsen, F., Johansen, W., Organizations, stakeholders, and intermediaries: Towards a general theory (2015) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 9 (4), pp. 253-271; Fredriksson, M., Pallas, J., Media enactments: Where to look for inspiration in mediatization studies (2014) Organizations and the media: Organizing in a mediatized world, , Pallas J., Strannegård L., Johnsson S., (eds), London, UK: Routledge; Fredriksson, M., Schillemans, T., Pallas, J., Determinants of organizational mediatization: An analysis of the adaption of Swedish government agencies to news media (2015) Public Administration, 93 (4), pp. 149-167; Garnett, J.L., Administrative communication: Domains, threats, and legitimacy (1997) Handbook of administrative communication, , Garnett J.L., Kouzmin A., (eds), New York, NY: Marcel Dekker; Graber, D.A., Political communication faces the 21st century (2005) Journal of Communication, 55 (3), pp. 479-507; Grøn, C.H., Salomonsen, H., Survey of Danish civil servants and politicians, 2014.

In this article, we use original surveys of prison officers in California and Minnesota to assess whether and how partisan identification and the politicization of crime policy predict officers' conceptualizations of the purpose and function of prisons. Results show that individual partisanship is associated with officers' attitudes, but this is conditional on state context. Along with deepening understandings about the determinants of street-level bureaucrats' perspectives, this article advances knowledge about how the broader political environment might shape the attitudes of front-line workers. This is important because prison officers' perspectives affect their workplace behaviour with consequences for staff-prisoner relationships, policy implementation and the routine operations of penal facilities. © 2015 The Author.","imprisonment; Politics of punishment; prison officer; street-level bureaucracy",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: SES-0617505; University of Pennsylvania, Penn; University of California, Irvine, UCI","Abramowitz, A., Saunders, K., Ideological realignment in the u.s.

Why was the 1990s the right time for rape to become an international security problem? Furthermore, why suddenly in the 1990s did rape become problematized as an international issue not just by the feminist fringes of protest movements but also by intergovernmental bureaucracies? To explore these questions, Carol Harrington traces the historical change in the politicization of rape as an international problem and explains how early international women's organizations gained expert authority on rape by drawing on abolitionist rhetoric of bodily integrity. She discusses why they abandoned their politicization of rape in the inter-war period and why rape only reappeared as an international security question requiring gender expertise on trauma after the Cold War. © Carol Harrington 2010.

It exposes the challenges Quebec is facing in this area and what cross-border activities fall within its jurisdiction. The supported hypothesis in this article is that security is subjected to an increasing politicization from the Quebec government in a post-9/11 context, which contributes to the edification of an embryonic “multilevel governance.” If this politicization was noticeable in political statements and international agreements, it seems that it was more driven by conjectural imperatives than a real desire to make Quebec a leader in transnational security. Therefore, there were no diplomatic and financial commitments to make security part of the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine and develop a similar paradiplomacy as in other fields. However, on different technical and bureaucratic levels, transgovernmental relations between certain Quebec governmental organizations, including police corps, and their American counterparts were created. Consequently, they contributed to make continental action more effective, at least in a certain measure. © 2016 ACSUS.","border; governance; paradiplomacy; Quebec; security; United States","border region; bureaucracy; cross-border relations; diplomatic relations; governance approach; international agreement; national security; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; United States",,,,,,"Ackleson, J., From “Thin” to “Thick” (And Back Again?): The Politics and Policies of the Contemporary US–Canada Border (2009) American Review of Canadian Studies, 39 (4), pp. 336-351; Andreas, P., Redrawing the Line: Borders and Security in the Twenty-First Century (2003) International Security, 28 (2), pp. 78-111. , Fall; Balibar, É., What Is a Border?

The main goal is understood to be to achieve parliamentary unity - or at least broad consensus, which can arguably be translated into additional influence in EU-level bargaining. But the outbreak of the euro crisis and the 2011 Eduskunta elections triggered a major domestic politicization of Europe, which also affected parliamentary behaviour. EU issues are now debated more often in the full chamber, while voting has become more common in the EAC, with the losing opposition minority adding its dissenting opinions to the EU reports of the committees. Drawing on Eduskunta records and interviews with members of parliament (MPs) and civil servants, three hypotheses about the driving force behind this politicization are formulated: conflicting logics of appropriateness among MPs, the strategic incentives of the Finns Party, and frustration about euro crisis decision making. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","EU; Euro crisis; Finland; National parliaments; Politicization; The Finns Party",,,,,,,"Ahlbäck Öberg, S., Jungar, A.-C., The influence of national parliaments over domestic European Union policies (2009) Scandinavian Political Studies, 32 (4), pp. 359-381; Arnold, C., Franklin, M.N., Assessing political representation in Europe (2012) West European Politics, 35 (6). , eds; Arter, D., (1987) Politics and Policy-Making in Finland: A Study of A Small Democracy in A West European Outpost, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Arter, D., (1999) Scandinavian Politics Today, , Manchester, UK: Manchester University Press; Arter, D., From a contingent party system to party system convergence?

The backwardness of Mexico’s education sector has persisted into the twenty-first century. Public education has exhibited a jarring lack of transparency as monitoring and evaluation systems have, at least until recently, been extremely weak. The sector has displayed major teacher payroll irregularities, chronic teacher absenteeism, and patronage-based practices in teacher hiring and management. In 2014, The Economist reported that 13 percent of the teacher payroll - or 298, 000 teachers - did not show up for work. In the state of Nayarit, a local boss of the teachers” union and his family members simultaneously held positions as salaried classroom teachers, school principals, and district supervisors - and enjoyed a sizable income stream - without performing any of the duties that these positions entailed (del Valle 2014c). These types of practices have contributed to the low quality of public schools. National and international standardized tests show that Mexican public school students have not learned basic skills in reading, math, and science. Mexico had the lowest average score of all OECD countries in those subjects on the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). While socio-economic status heavily influenced these results (OECD 2013), the politicization of schools has surely also impacted achievement. The political clout of the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE) helps to account for the backwardness of public education and the inability of governments to enact significant changes in policy. Since the union was founded in 1943, SNTE has incrementally expanded its patrimonial power over the public school system. According to Max Weber, patrimonial power is a traditional form of domination in which a leader, who is not constrained by legal-rational rules, uses his or her official power to serve personal ends (Weber 1968). Embodying the concept of patrimonialism, union leaders exerted influence over the appointment of high-level officials in the education bureaucracy, placed union loyalists in significant administrative positions in schools, and influenced teacher hiring and promotion up the salary scale. Only in 2013, after the implementation of landmark education laws that reasserted the state’s authority over the education sector, were there signs that the union’s political power may have reached its limits. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,,,,,,"Hernández, A., Carlos, J., La Alianza por la Calidad de la Educación: Modernización de los Centros Escolares y Profesionalización de los Maestros (2009) Centro de Estudios Sociales y de Opinión Pública., , Documento de Trabajo Núm. 74; Arnaut, A., La Federalización de la Educación Básica y Normal (1978-1994) (1994) Política y Gobierno, 1 (2), pp. 237-274; Baranda, A., Acusan Alteración de la Ley Educativa (2014) Reforma, , April 16; Barrera, I., Myers, R., (2011) Estándares y Evaluación Docente en México: El Estado del Debate, , Serie Documentos No. 59.

In the final years of the nineteenth century and the period leading up to the Rising in the early twentieth century, the biggest commemorative events recalled the Manchester Martyrs of 1867 and, especially, the rebellion of 1798. The widespread flurry of excitement and activity surrounding the latter's centenary commemoration in 1898 contributed to the politicisation of a generation of young people, many of whom would go on to organise, execute, and witness the Easter Rising – the so-called ‘Rising generation’. But their very successes contributed to a decline in enthusiasm for commemorating the rebellion that inspired them. This chapter traces the relationship between this generation of young people and the social memory of the rebellion of 1798. It argues that the ’98 centenary helped to politicise many of the young and to model revolution for them, but that the succeeding revolutionary period of 1916–1923 nevertheless occasioned a shift in the Irish memorial tradition away from the 1798 rebellion and towards the Easter Rising. The chapter first outlines the politicising effects of the centenary and the public enthusiasm it generated on the generation of young people who witnessed it, before turning to examine the memorial turn away from 1798. Throughout, the ‘lifecycle’ of one monument in particular, the Kerry ’98 memorial in Tralee, will be particularly illustrative and serve to demonstrate the three principal reasons underlying the shift. First, the violence of the intervening years and the bleak outlook of the early Free State raised questions about the valorisation of violent national mythology; second, the grass-roots movements that initially spurred the commemorative fervour had been calcified into processes of state and bureaucracy that no longer held the same power to rally great interest; and finally, the Rising itself and the memory of the ‘Rising generation’ mingled with and ultimately displaced ’98 in the commemorative landscape. In the increasingly tense political environment of the Home Rule debate and land reforms at the end of the nineteenth century, the ’98 centenary offered an occasion to draw together disparate factions of Irish nationalists in support of unified commemorative efforts and to introduce young people to the politics of national remembrance. © Richard S.

This article focuses on the institutional approach of three levels of interaction: the intergovernmental level (IGL) describes traditional contacts among heads of states or governments as well as among ministers; the transgovernmental level (TGL) consists of relations among civil servants of middle and low rank; and the transnational level (TNL) includes the dialogue of non-governmental participants such as business, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and epistemic communities. Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye identified TGL and TNL, but the studies of these levels has intensified as a result of burgeoning links among civil servants, business, NGOs and experts from different countries. Transgovernmental and transnational interactions stabilize relations among various actors. This article clarifies the stabilizing potential of TGL and TNL interactions. First, the degree of autonomy of civil servants from the political level of government has to be taken into account. Second, the state regulates the level of independence of both business and NGOs. TGL and TNL interactions can stabilize relations only if civil servants are independent from the political level in what concerns technical issues and where both business and civil society are strong. Third, real economic interdependence matters because it forms an agenda of cooperation in a particular field. The intensification of trade and investment flows does not automatically lead to real interdependence. In this case, contacts at the transgovernmental and transnational levels acquire a formal character and no cooperation emerges, which does not allow for stabilized relations in crisis situations at the IGL. The empirical section of the article demonstrates how widening and deepening relations between the European Union and Russia, especially since 2000, led to thickening transgovernmental and transnational interactions but these levels failed to stabilize relations between Moscow and Brussels following the 2014 Ukrainian crisis. On the contrary, the EU' s reaction (sanctions) led to the destruction of economic links at both levels, whereas Russia deconstructed transnational non-profit relations. Tensions at the IGL also negatively affected the epistemic community (a part of the TNL), leading to its politicization. Changes and fine-tunings in the concept of institutional levels of analysis, suggested in the article, help to explain recent developments in EU - Russian relations. The article also recommends purposefully restoring relations at the transgovernmental and transnational levels to facilitate overcoming of the crisis in EU - Russian relations.","Business; Civil society; Epistemic community; European Union - Russian relations; Interdependence; Non-governmental organizations (NGOs); Third sector; Transgovernmental relations; Transnational relations",,,,,,,"Abbott, K.W., Snidal, D., International ""Standards"" and International Governance (2001) Journal of European Public Policy, 8 (3), pp. 345-370; Alekseeva, L.M., ""Tretii sektor"" i vlast' [The Third Sector' and the Power] (2002) Obshhestvennye nauki i sovremennost', (6), pp. 52-58. , (In Russian.); Andersen, K., Squaring the Circle?

The empirical part of the article is based on a large-N inquiry among ministerial officials that were divided into four groups (directors of section, directors of department, heads of division, rank-and-file officials) following their work position. From the theory perspective, the article builds upon two types of politicization - formal and functional - with the latter further subdivided into hidden and partisan politicization. Such theoretical assumptions help towards formulating six hypotheses verified with relation to the four work positions. The corresponding analysis of officials' perceptions by position attests to a rather limited extent of the two main types of politicization with the exception of functional politicization of top management (director of section). Compared to the other three positions, directors of section show more proclivity to personal contacts (functional-hidden politicization) or to direct party political nomination (functional-partisan politicization). Unlike the conclusions of previous, largely expert or qualitative, inquiries, the officials' perceptions generally point towards rather moderate politicization of the Czech ministries without excessive direct influence of political representatives.","Bureaucracy; Czech Republic; Ministry; Politicisation; Public administration",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Introduction: Administration in an Era of Change (2003) Governance, 16 (3), pp. 315-319; Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., The Past and Future of Political-Administrative Relations: Research from Bureaucrats and Politicians to In the Web of Politics-and Beyond (2006) International Journal of Public Administration, 29 (12), pp. 977-995; Beblavý, M., Beblavá, E., Ondrušová, D., He Who Appoints the Piper: Understanding Reasons and Implications of Agency Management 'Politicisation' in Slovakia (2012) NISPAcee Journal of Public Administration and Policy, 5 (2), pp. 121-139; Bouchal, P., Janský, P., (2014) ""Státní úredníci: kolik jich vlastne je, kde a za jaké platy pracují?""

The nature of this relationship can potentially have far-reaching effects on people’s lives as it can influence the type of public policy agreed at top levels of government. A total of sixteen interviews were carried out for the research, eight with retired Cabinet-level Ministers and eight with retired Secretaries General of Irish government departments. Anonymity, not just for the participants but also for the government departments in which they had served, was vital to the success of the research. Also vital was the fact that only retirees were interviewed as this removed the fear for participants that their careers might suffer if they spoke too frankly. The result is a collection of interviews containing frank and open views on the relationship between Ministers and their officials and on how this relationship influences public policy development. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.",,,,,,,,"Barrington, T., (1980) The Irish administrative system, , Dublin: Institute of Public Administration; Hood, C., Lodge, M., (2006) The politics of public service bargains: Reward, competency, loyalty and blame, , New York: Oxford University Press; Neuhold, C., Vanhoonacker, S., Introduction (2013) Civil servants and politics, a delicate balance, , S.

Mickevičiaus g. 37, Kaunas, LT-44240, Lithuania","The paper focuses on the conceptualization of party patronage. The analysis of the usage of the term party patronage reveals several challenges: scholars from different fields use different definitions of party patronage, in addition same phenomena can be described by different concepts making it difficult to compare data from different surveys or analysis. Furthermore the term itself must be revised continuously as it can become out dated due to changing aspects of party patronage in modern world. To clarify the usage of term party patronage it is important to define contiguous phenomenon such as clientelism, politicization, state capture, pork barrel and corruption. Hence this paper suggests slightly modified conceptualization used by Kopecky et al.: party patronage as power of political parties to make personnel decisions in the public sector for Lithuanian social sciences. Party patronage is defined by three dimensions: who makes the decision, what are the decisions and where those decisions are made? In case of party patronage political parties acts as collective patrons and they make decisions of the personnel matter (hiring, promoting and transferring of public servants) in public sector. This conceptualization enables to show differences between party patronage and contiguous phenomenon. In short clientelism should be understood as an electoral resource of the political party, while party patronage should be understood as an organizational and governmental resource. Concept of politicization is closely connected to party patronage, however politicization is more suitable for public administrative studies as it is directed to the separation of bureaucrats and politicians while party patronage in political science puts attention on the political power of parties to make personal decisions. State capture is defined as systematic influence of business to government in order to obtain favorable legal and regulatory decisions. Pork barrel politics means direction of funding and legislation towards certain constituency or geographical region. Corruption should be understood as abuse of authority and power for personal gain.","Clientelism; Conceptualization; Party patronage; Politicization; Pork barrel.; State capture",,,,,,,"Aceituno-Montes, J.M., Robles-Egea, A., (2011) An Impossible Democracy Political Clientelism and Corruption in Andalusia, , ECPR General Conference.

Most of the pro elections through the Regional Representatives Council (DPRD) assume Pancasila democracy is reflected in the elections elected by Parliament with the advantage of the state finance saving, avoiding fraud, split nation, black campaign that has been going on so massive and structured. Choosing a Leader in Parliament Election with the media is the best move forwards the implementation of Pancasila Democracy where deliberation and consensus as the primary basis in decision making. While the Election by direct election for this look has been ""robbed"" of the people because of the massive political legitimacy money, black and political campaigns pitting. Another advantage is more simple and efficient as well as reducing the potential for social conflict, in addition can create patterns of relationships and the DPRD head relatively harmonious. However, a group of pro with the election by parliament also a number of disadvantages election not through representatives, among others, reducing the local democratic process and encourage the strengthening of the political oligarchy and money in Parliament. While some people are pro with direct election assess local elections by the people will reflect a higher level of legitimacy than through Parliament. They assess the local elections by the people reflects the realization of the rights and sovereignty of the people, the people's participation in the elections, and strengthen legitimacy.

Risk society: Towards a new modernity. London, UK: Sage, Beck, Ulrich. 1999. World risk society. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press) has called modern society, has changed the policy dynamics of many high-risk policies. Policy conflicts occur due to both physically objective risks and socially constructed risks. Risk politicization means that issue expansion and attention cycles are likely to be related to the social construction of policy images. An interesting case in point concerns the risk perception about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) among four groups of people in South Korea: bureaucrats, citizens, scientists, and interest groups. We develop expectations about how the four groups will frame the political issues based on their roles and concerns in the policy process. Downs' (Downs, Anthony. 1972. Up and down with ecology: The issue-attention cycle. Public Interest 28:38-50) work on the issue-attention cycle suggests how issues rise and fall on the public agenda, and our work also directly tests his theses. This study uses semantic network analysis based on content analysis of key words in 6400 articles published in 2008 to construct semantic networks for the four stakeholder groups over four stages in the policy process. Through this unique data analysis, we can see the major issue concerns and intensity of each of the four groups in the four policy stages by assessing the key words each group uses in the media articles and the visualizations of their semantic associations. We do find distinct differences in what issues each of the four groups focus on and how the focus of substance changes in each of the four policy stages that clarify how these groups framed the BSE policy issues. Our results both confirm and raise doubts about some predictions from the issue-attention cycle. Citizens' attention follows closely to Downs' predictions, whereas the other stakeholders' issue-attention cycles do not follow Downs' predictions as well. Finally, our study explains and demonstrates the value of semantic network analysis as a powerful method for understanding issue framing in the policy process. © 2015 The Author.",,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., (1983) The Architecture of Cognition, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ.

This article analyses a participatory process organised in France by an activist-professional facilitator with a small group of bureaucrats and marginalized individuals, designed to promote mutual understanding and raise public issues. This ethnography shows that deliberation in small groups, rather than merely producing consensus and reproducing inequalities in accessing forms of public expression as is sometimes alleged, may generate at least preliminary politicization and the publicization of social issues in working-class districts. These rather fragile effects raise the question of the continuity of collective action and institutional transformations generated by deliberative processes. © 2016, © 2016 European Sociological Association.","conflict; counter-power; deliberation; politicization; publicization",,,,,,,"Arendt, H., (1958) The human condition, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Bacqué, M.-H., Biewener, C., (2013) L'empowerment, une pratique émancipatrice, , Paris: La Découverte; Barnes, M., Newman, J., Sullivan, H., (2007) Power, participation and political renewal: Case studies in public participation, , Bristol: Policy Press; Berger, M., The politics of copresence: An ecological approach to resistance in top-down participation?

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, I analyse how ‘the border’ became inscribed into politics and power relations in Muzaffarabad through a locally contested ‘reconstruction bureaucracy’ which provided Pakistan with the means to dominate reconstruction in Azad Kashmir. Activists from Muzaffarabad politicised the delay of reconstruction by addressing Pakistan's interference in Azad Kashmir's affairs. Local politicisation of reconstruction, however, revealed contradictory effects of ‘the border’ on power relations in Muzaffarabad. From the activists’ perspectives, political boundaries between Pakistan and Azad Kashmir were characterised by domination as well as cooperation that undermined local concerns such as the reconstruction of Muzaffarabad. Thus, local activists also opposed ‘their’ government and transgressed ‘the border’ into Pakistan through the creation of alliances with national actors in order to put pressure on the government of Azad Kashmir. In taking advantage of power disparities between Pakistan and Azad Kashmir, these alliances, however, not only reproduced but also undermined the nation state's domination over the region by manipulating and circumventing the ‘reconstruction bureaucracy’. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Azad Kashmir; border; local politics; Pakistan; reconstruction","anthropology; border region; bureaucracy; nation state; political boundary; political power; politics; power relations; reconstruction; Azad Kashmir; Muzaffarabad; Pakistan",,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","Alvarez, R., The Mexican-US Border: The Making of an Anthropology of Borderlands (1995) Annual Review of Anthropology, 24, pp. 447-470; Asif, B., How Independent is Azad Jammu and Kashmir?

Through behind-the-scenes ethnographic methods, it explores how key bureaucratic values such as impartiality, neutrality and loyalty are challenged and modified by the impact of the news media. A key question is to what extent this process of mediatization overlaps with a more general trend of politicization of the civil service. The article first documents that media pressure generates comprehensive strategies aimed at servicing the press, but also different types of information control and internal steering. Second, it describes how media management has become an important concern within public administration, which identifies strongly with the bureaucratic system and its values, and protects and defends it in the media. The article introduces the term 'administrative loyalty' to describe these practices and standards that go beyond the imperative to loyally serve the media-related needs of political superiors. © 2014 Nordic Political Science Association.",,,,,,,,"Ackerman, J.M., Sandoval-Ballesteros, I.E., Global Explosion of Freedom of Information Laws (2006) Administrative Law Review, 58, pp. 85-123; (2009) Central Government Communication, , Oslo: Norwegian Ministry of Government Administration and Reform (AD); Altheide, D.L., Media Logic and Political Communication (2004) Political Communication, 21 (3), pp. 293-296; Aucoin, P., New Political Governance in Westminster Systems: Impartial Public Administration and Management Performance at Risk (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Bezes, P., Fimreite, A.L., Lidec, P.L., Lægreid, P., Understanding Organizational Reforms in the Modern State: Specialization and Integration in Norway and France (2013) Governance, 26 (1), pp. 147-175; Carpenter, D., (2001) The Forging of Bureaucratic Autonomy: Reputations, Networks, Reputations and Policy Innovation in Executive Agencies, 1862-1928, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Carpenter, D.P., Krause, G.A., Reputation and Public Administration (2012) Public Administration Review, 72 (1), pp. 26-32; Christensen, T., The Development and Current Features of the Norwegian Civil Service System (2011) Civil Systems in Western Europe, , Van der Meer, F.

The weaknesses of politicization are even more devastating in smaller states such as Slovenia, as they have a limited amount of human resources available. Based on a detailed analysis of the politicization of civil service in Slovenia, the authors can confirm that the level of politicization is quite high. After accession into the European Union (2004) and the adoption of austerity laws (2010-2013), politicization increased even further. Despite the formal existence of a meritocratic civil service system, politicians have an increasingly decisive role in the employment and advancement of civil servants, and total control over the appointment and dismissal of senior civil servants. The authors conclude that the predominance of politicians with relationships to senior civil servants can be changed with relatively simple adjustments to formal acts.","Civil service; Formal and material politicization; Politicians; Politicization; Public administration; State administration",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians and Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Act on additional intervention measures, (2011) Official Gazette of Slovenia, 110; Act to restore public finances, (2012) Official Gazette of Slovenia, 40. , 2012; Brezovšek, M., Kukovič, S., Institucionalni Vidiki Lokalnega Političnega Vodenja v Evropi: Primerjalna Analiza (2014) Teorija in Praksa, 51 (6), pp. 1091-1110; Bučar, F., Reforma javne uprave (2001) Uvod v Javno Upravo, pp. 79-86. , In: (Stane Vlaj, ed.).

It never had integrative capacity, but in recent years accumulated the integration potential in regional relations. The common position formation principles in international policy are being carried out by the Visegrad Four. Notable is the emergence of really important issues and explicit politicization of the agenda. The defense theme, the problem of energy security, coordination of positions on the EU budget etc. were included into discussions. At the same time, exacerbated contradictions exist in these areas. Key factors currently affecting the development of the Visegrad Group are: The confrontation of great powers in the region, the inert nature of relationship between the Visegrad countries and the United States, the anarchy in European policy, the prevalence of extra-regional conditions and incentives, the lack of specifi c regional rules and the void of its institutionalization. The Ukrainian crisis once again emphasizes the importance of the regional policy external actors - the U.S., Germany, Russia and the Brussels EU bureaucracy. It was the cause of the schism emerging in East European politics, and slowed down the process of the intra-regional incentives formation as well as of the communications concentration. It is forcing the Visegrad countries to grasp their limitrophe position. A perspective of the Visegrad partnership is unclear, but it is noteworthy that regional relations become increasingly important for their participants.","Central and Eastern Europe.; EU; European security; Foreign policy of Poland; Ukrainian crisis; Visegrad Group",,,,,,,"Corbey, D., Dialectical functionalism stagnation as a booster of european integration (1995) International Organization, 49 (2), pp. 253-284; Pehe, J., Pochybnosti o visegru (2011) Mezinodnpolitika, 35 (3), pp. 18-19; Informacja Ministra Spraw Zagranicznych O Zalozeniach Polskiej Polityki Zagranicznej W 2010 Roku, , http://www.wgf2010.eu/statement/71194-bozenna-bukiewicz/, Posiedzenie nr 64 Sejmu Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej VI kadencji w dniu 8 kwietnia 2010 (drugi dzień obrad), 08.04.2010 Available at(accessed 25.01.2014); Semushin, D., Vyshegradskaya Gruppa Soedinilas S Veimarskim Treugolnikom Proryv v Myslyakh"" Na Sammite v Varshave, , http://www.regnum.ru/news/polit/1633895.html#ixzz2b4AzwrzS, [The Visegrad Group Got Connected with the Weimar Triangle: ""Breakthrough Thinking"" at the Summit in Warsaw] IA REGNUM, 09.03.2013.] Available at (accessed 25.01.2014; Pehe, J., (2006) Hospodřknoviny, , http://www.pehe.cz/Members/redaktor/radeji-visegrad-dejme-k-ledu, Raději Visegr dejme k ledu26.07 Available at (accessed 25.01.2014; Radio Praha, , http://radio.cz/ru/rubrika/bulletin/obzornovostej-dnya-2014-04-03, Visegrad Four Will Take Slovenia and Austria into Its Ranks (In Russ.)] 03.04.2014 Available at (accessed 25.01.2014; Common Declaration of Germany and the Visegrad Group on the EU Southern Neighbourhood Policy, , http://www.visegradgroup.eu/2011/common-declaration-of, Available at (accessed 25.01.2014); The Visegrad Group and Germany Foreign Ministers Statement on the Eastern Partnership, , http://www.auswaertiges-Amt.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/566368/publicationFile/148691/110303-ErklaerungOeP.doc, Available at (accessed 25.01.2014); http://zn.ua/POLITICS/chehiya-v-perspektive-viditukrainu-v-vyshegradskoy-gruppe-130876_.html, ZN.UA 14.10.2013 Available at accessed 25.01.2014; Carden, J.W., Poland and america need a fresh start National Interest, , http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/poland-America-need-fresh-start-8949), 26.08.2013 Available at (accessed 25.01.2014); Cienski, J., (2009) The Decline of America and Polands Special Relationship, , www.globalpost.com/dispatch/poland/090909/poland-usa-foreign-policy, September 10 Updated May 30 2010 Available at (accessed 25.01.2014); Tusk: Potwierdzilem Bidenowi, Ze Nie Weźmiemy Udzialu W Akcji Zbrojnej W Syrii, , http://wyborcza.pl/1.91446.14578106,Tusk-_potwierdzilem_Bidenowi_ze_nie_wezmiemy_udzialu.html#ixzz2fYa0EQV6, PAP, 10.09.2013 Available at (accessed 25.01.2014); Powstanie wyszehradzka grupa bojowa (2007) Dziennik, 1210. , http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/swiat/artykuly/199206powstanie-wyszehradzka-grupa-bojowa.html, Available at (accessed 25.01.2014); Balcer, A., A wishful thinking?

Not only does diplomacy attract the pretended ‘elites’ of the public sector’s employees but also a lot of popular criticism with regard to its performances, transparency, dedication to public interest, procedures of recruitment, privileges, and sometimes moral exigencies. This paradoxical ambivalence of ‘elitism’ and public distrust coexists with variable degrees of tension between politicization and the need of effective technocracy. This article explores the concepts, delimitations and functioning of the political-ideological vs. administrative components of diplomatic systems, in the wider context of the administrative paradigms and political cultures to which they belong. While the theoretical distinction between foreign policy and diplomacy is way more developed in European classical approaches, though with controversial results, the American authors and officials traditionally use the two concepts interchangeably. Notwithstanding this theoretical flexibility, the borderline between the political level of diplomatic representation and the professional diplomatic and consular corps is clearer and better regulated in the U.S. system than in most of the European countries. A case study focused on the reform of the Romanian diplomatic service, in the pre- and post-EU accession years, serves as empirical analysis of this demarche. © 2015, Universitatea Babes-Bolyai.

A model locating them across a spectrum of six related yet distinct genres of ‘centrism’, and a continuum of five contingent descriptive styles is used to illustrate and interpret their praxis. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Centrism; civil service; permanent secretaries; policy; policy styles; politicisation",,,,,,,"Barberis, P., Permanent secretaries and policy making in the 1980s (1994) Public Policy and Administration, 9, pp. 35-48; Barberis, P., (1996) The Elite of the Elite, , Aldershot, Dartmouth; Blair, T., (2011) A Journey, , London, Random House; (1995) The Civil Service: Taking Forward Continuity and Change (Cm 2748), , London, HMSO; Cameron, S., (2012) The Telegraph; (1988) Ethics in the British Civil Service, , London, Routledge; Dowding, K., James, O., Analysing bureau-shaping models: Comments on Marsh, Smith and Richards (2004) British Journal of Political Science, 34, pp. 183-189; Downs, A., (1967) Inside Bureaucracy, , Boston, Little, Brown; Dunleavy, P., (1991) Democracy, Bureaucracy and Public Choice, , London, Pearson; Ford, J., (1975) Paradigms and Fairy Tales: An Introduction to the Science of Meaning, , London, Routledge; Fry, G., The development of the Thatcher government's ‘grand strategy’ for the civil service (1984) Public Administration, 62, pp. 322-335; Fry, G., The British career civil service under challenge (1986) Political Studies, 34, pp. 533-555; Gains, F., John, P., What do bureaucrats like doing?

The research revealed that over the analysed period the average extent of politicisation of ministerial senior career civil servants amounted to 39%, while the total share of politicised servants varied between 25% and 45%. Evidence shows that demand-side factors, such as the scale of alteration of ruling majorities or alteration of parties holding minister portfolio, are insufficient to explain the turnover and politicisation of senior career civil servants in ministries. In contrast, supply-side factors, namely the existence of suitable partisan candidates to fill high-ranking positions in the ministries and opportunities for politicisation, have higher explanatory power. In addition, the negative relationship between structural and de facto politicisation, as well as the positive relationship between the amount of state budget allocations for institutions and agencies in the minister's field of activity and the degree of politicisation of senior career civil service in the respective ministries was identified. © Aušra Baceviciute, 2015.",,,,,,,,"Alfa, Labiausiai politizuotos ministerijos, , http://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/49787283/labiausiai-politizuotos-ministerijos, 2015 01 16, 2015 08 01; Alfa, Premjero patare˙ja daro karjera, , http://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/c14083/, 2007 01 02, 2015 01 05; Bakaveckas, A., 'Vykdomosios valdžios instituciju sistemos raida atkūrus nepriklausomybe' (2002) Jurisprudencija, 26 (18); Bogušinskaite, I., Nakrošis, V., 'Lietuvos Vyriausybe˙s istaigu ir istaigu prie ministeriju vadovu kaita ir politizacija' (2014) Politologija, 2 (74); Čeponyte, E., 'Lietuvos švietimo istaigu vadovu politizacija: Vilniaus miesto ir Vilniaus rajono savivaldybiu lyginamoji analize˙' (2014) Politologija, 2 (74); Delfi, J., Liaudanskas pasitrauke˙ iš FNTT, , http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/jliaudanskas-pasitrauke-is-fntt.d?id=5698742, 2004 12 22, 2015 03 30; Delfi, Ministeriju pilkieji kardinolai, , http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/ministeriju-pilkieji-kardinolai.d?id=13846252, 2007 07 21, 2015 03 30; Delfi, Ministeriju sekretoriai gali krautis lagaminus, , http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/ministeriju-sekretoriai-gali-krautis-lagaminus.d?id=20437344#ixzz3DHxtC85g, 2009 02 05, 2014 12 03; Delfi, Valdžiu kaita-košmaras valstybe˙s tarnautojams, , http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/valdziu-kaita-kosmaras-valstybestarnautojams.d?id=18927941, 2008 10 18, 2015 01 05; Heywood, P., Meyer-Sahling, J.-H., (2008) Corruption Risks and the Management of the Ministerial Bureaucracy in Poland, , Varšuva: Ernst &Young; Kauno diena, Konkursai tapo fikcijos sinonimu, , http://kauno.diena.lt/dienrastis/kita/konkursai-tapo-fikcijos-sinonimu-10835#.VUX-GPmqqko, 2003 07 18, 2015 03 30; Kazakevičius, G., 'Lojalumo struktūros itaka Lietuvos viešojo sektoriaus politizacijai' (2014) Politologija, 2 (74); Keršanskas, V., 'Švogeriškas"" viešojo sektoriaus modelis pamažu keiciasi' (2013) Veidas, 43; Kopecky, P., Mair, P., 'Conclusion: Party Patronage in Contemporary Europe' (2012) Party Patronage and Party Government in European Democracies, , Kopecky P., Mair P., Spirova M.

The reforms aim to improve public governance and transparency while reducing corruption and dishonesty. Methodology/approach: Qualitative (thematic) analysis has been employed by using both primary and secondary data. Primary data was obtained by interviewing selected respondents from public sector organisations in Sri Lanka. The respondents were selected by using an expert purposive sampling technique. Apart from the primary data, secondary data such as government reports, relevant literature and paper articles was also analysed in order to produce more robust findings. Findings: The findings indicate that technological and cultural factors have influenced accounting reforms in the public sector in Sri Lanka. In addition, the politicisation and bureaucracy of the public sector as well as sluggish attitudes towards costs have served as prominent barriers to efficient implementation of the reforms. Research limitations: This study was limited in terms of generalisation because of relatively small sample sizes. A larger sample with more diversity could have enhanced the generalisation of the results which could serve as direction for further research. Originality/value: This paper is intended to fill a gap in the existing literature on public sector accounting reforms in the context of less developed or emerging countries. It is hopefully valuable for both policy makers and practitioners by allowing them to view the development, challenges and influential aspects of the implementation of New Public Management (NPM) in Sri Lanka in order that they will be able to make informed decisions about adopting more efficient NPM practices to enhance the country's competitive advantages.

Taking three ethnographic examples from Norway as my point of departure, I investigate how political scientist Stein Rokkan's perspective on cross-cutting cleavages may be used to provide a deeper insight into the management of power in public institutions. I further discuss how people's values and interests are translated into political alliances and how the patterns of conflict generated influence institutions formally and informally. A methodological argument forwarded in relation to this is that in order to gain analytical insight into how institutions are embedded and in part controlled in (more or less local) social systems and networks, we have to investigate how people move across formal institutional boundaries, roles and loyalties. Alliances that generate shifting and cross-cutting conflicts may give rise to horizontal forms of solidarity within formal, hierarchical institutions and in this way contribute to controlling power from below, but also to delimiting the effects of politicization processes and insensitivity in public bureaucracies. © 2015 Universitetsforlaget.","Bureaucracy; Cleavages; Cross-cutting; Equality; Horizontal solidarity; Institutionalization; States",,,,,,,"Aleksander, J., (1998) Real Civil Societies: Dilemmas of Institutionalization, , London: Sage; Anderson, E.N., (1996) Ecologies of the Heart.

This article contributes to this literature by systematically identifying different conceptualizations of politicization and suggests a typology including three politicization mechanisms to strengthen the political responsiveness of the ministerial bureaucracy: formal, functional and administrative politicization. The typology is empirically validated through a comparative case analysis of politicization mechanisms in Germany, Belgium, the UK and Denmark. The empirical analysis further refines the general idea of Western democracies becoming ‘simply’ more politicized, by illustrating how some politicization mechanisms do not continue to increase, but stabilize – at least for the time being. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","central administration; ministers and civil servants; political advisers; political responsiveness; politicization; public administration","bureaucracy; centralization; civil service; comparative study; conceptual framework; public administration; Belgium; Denmark; Germany; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , ,,.

It focuses on the practical work of the civil servants at the Ministry of Ecology responsible for deciding on the orientations of the reform, for transcribing them into legal language and ensuring the provisions are supported and passed in Parliament. The analysis hunts down both the successive versions of the bill and the multiple documents used in the preparatory phase. Delving into the administrative production of the law provides a better understanding of the relations between the civil service and the political authorities, and shows how difficult it is to draw the boundary between those two worlds of practice. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Central administration; Drafting the law; Industrial risks; Legislative production; Ministry of Ecology; Politicization; Technicization",,,,,,,"Abélès, M., (2000) Un ethnologue à l'Assemblée, , Odile Jacob, Paris; Arnaud, A.-J., Le Droit comme produit.

The amount of intergovernmental fiscal transfers should be inversely related to each local jurisdiction’s revenue-generating capacity. However, intense politicking in many countries turns an intergovernmental fiscal transfer system into a battle of local and particularistic interests. This article illustrates a disjuncture between the theory and practice of intergovernmental equalization transfers with the quantitative and qualitative evidence from 226 local administrative organizations in Khon Kaen province in northeastern Thailand. Findings indicate that Thailand’s current intergovernmental fiscal transfer system is not oriented toward achieving local horizontal equity. In Khon Kaen, local administrative organizations with high fiscal capacity tend to receive more equalization grants than financially disadvantaged jurisdictions. In-depth interviews with selected local government officials in Khon Kaen reveal inconsistency and heavy politicization of the country’s intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. © 2014 SAGE Publications.","decentralization; equalization transfers; horizontal fiscal imbalance; intergovernmental fiscal system; local government finances","financial provision; fiscal reform; intergovernmental relations; political change; Thailand",,,,,,"Bahl, R., (2000) Intergovernmental transfers in developing and transition countries: Principles and practice, , Washington, DC, World Bank, urban and Local Government, Municipal Finance; Bird, R., (1992) Tax policy and economic development, , Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University Press; Bird, R.M., Smart, M., Intergovernmental fiscal transfers: International lessons for developing countries (2002) World Development, 30 (6), pp. 899-912; Boex, J., Martinez-Vazquez, J., (2007) Fiscal equalization: Challenges in the design of intergovernmental transfers, pp. 291-343. , Martinez-Vasquez J.Searle Bob, ed.

The analysis looks at the disentanglement of interest groups from parties and the autonomous role of the former in policy making. As in other European countries, since the 1980s, in Italy an accelerating decline of parties has been observed, along with a growing empowerment of interest groups. Furthermore, in the first part of the 1990s, the Italian party system collapsed giving rise to a ‘political transition’ which represented a window of opportunity for substantial turn-over in the political elite, a majoritarian electoral reform, devolution, privatization, and policy reforms in a range of important sectors. The articles in the symposium start from a policy studies perspective and analyse the expected changes in party-group relationships in three different policy areas: agriculture, pensions and transport. On the basis of a brief literature review, this introductory essay presents some general considerations on the issue of party-group relations. It then looks at their evolution and features in the Italian case, focusing on the disentanglement of parties and groups in recent years. Afterwards it outlines the common analytical framework for the subsequent contributions on different policy areas. An interesting but varied picture comes to light about the effective dynamics of party-group relations in the fragmented process of Italian policy making. Firstly we observe specific arrangements related to the number of interest organisations operating within different policy areas. Secondly, common dynamics are registered with regard to the privileged and routine relationships between groups and ministerial bureaucracies. Thirdly, the parties are no longer the gatekeepers for interest groups’ access to decision making; they no longer control the policy-making process. Within the different policy areas the authors have looked at variable configurations of factors (the salience and politicisation of issues, external inputs and Europeanization, the policy legacy) and policy-making actors in order to understand the changing relationships between new political parties and more numerous interest groups. © The Founding Editors, Contemporary Italian Politics.","Disentanglement; Interest groups; Italy; Party-group relationships; Policy making",,,,,,,"Allern, E.H., (2010) Political Parties and Interest Groups in Norway, , Colchester: ECPR Press; Allern, E., Bale, T., Political Parties and Interest Groups: Disentangling Complex Relationships (2012) Party Politics, 18 (1), pp. 7-25; Almagisti, M., Lanzalaco, L., Verzichelli, L., (2014) La Transizione Politica Italiana.

A decade ago Mexico was featured by many as a paradigmatic example of institutional engineering for accountability, including sophisticated constitutional reforms creating regulatory and oversight agencies, freedom of information provisions and citizen empowerment. But in spite of these formal achievements, the country has in fact become an example of bureaucratization, over-politicization and the watering-down of accountability. Many expected the emergence of vigorous political competition over the last two decades in Mexico to have a positive impact on corruption and accountability. But this has not been the case since competition between political parties has not translated into better oversight or an improved equilibrium between social interests and government institutions. In this chapter, I will explore the details of this process in order to learn how best to understand, define and practice transparency in a way that prevents the “freezing” of democratization processes in the developing world. If new democracies are unable to demonstrate that they are more effective and accountable than the previous authoritarian systems, democracy and elections are put at risk. In addition, transparency, like democracy, is a “politically contested” concept that can be interpreted and practiced in a variety of ways. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2014.",,,,,,,,"O’Donnell, G., Delegative Democracy (1994) Journal of Democracy, 5 (1), pp. 55-69. , January; Huntington, S.P., (1992) The Third Wave Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century, p. 366. , University of Oklahoma Press; O’Donnell, G., Illusions about Consolidation Journal of Democracy, , Vol. 7, No. 2, March 1996: 43-51; El Financiero, , http://www.mediasolutions.com.mx/ncpop.asp?n=201303190344517401&t=1, 19 March 2013; Mexico’s Disappeared.

Senior civil servants use both their wide range of skills and their family networks to control administrative and political life. This is why the democratic transition after 1975 left the structure of the administrative elite structures intact. The administrative elite has provided the main recruiting ground for political staff during the various governments of the democratic era. In addition, high-level positions are heavily politicised, a situation which has persisted under both socialist and right-wing governments. There is a similar politicisation of the civil service of the autonomous communities. There has never been any separation between administrative and political elites in Spain, and this has jeopardised attempts to reform public management.","Administrative elites; Democratic transition; Political elites; Spain",,,,,,,"Alba, C., Politique et administration en espagne: Continuité historique et perspectives (1998) Revue Française D'administration Publique, 86, pp. 229-241; Alba, C., Navarro, C., Working for the government in Spain: From authoritarian centralism to democratic political devolution (2005) The State at Work.

This tool can be used in comparative studies of CCSMS across, but also within countries, since civil service management functions are often split between several central organizations in one country. The comparative study of CCSMS is particularly useful for contemporary policy makers in EU member states, who currently face the challenge of reforming civil service systems due to EU pressure. There is therefore an urgent need to establish which type of central structure would effectively support the EU's favored values of professionalizing and de-politicizing the civil service. Stemming from theory on organizational autonomy, our typology focuses on two key dimensions of the CCSMS that support these values: decision-making autonomy over individual civil servants and structural accountability. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.","central structures; civil service; civil service management; decision-making autonomy; organizational autonomy",,,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE: APVV-0880-12","Armstrong, M., (2009) Armstrong's Handbook of Human Resource Management Practice, , London and Philadelphia: Kogan Page Publishers; Brown, K., Human resource management in the public sector (2004) Public Management Review, 6 (3), pp. 303-309; Demmke, C., Nomden, K., Polet, R., (2001) Civil services in the Europe of fifteen, , In D.

This article challenges the view held by many scholars and practitioners of public administration and the public at large that there are available options dividing the politics and the administration of government, and that such is achievable in South Africa. In Africa and worldwide the citizens complain and associate the benefits of a government administration to be exclusive to a certain sector of individuals and their groups with sound political connections and inter-relationships. While today most government administrations claim to operate through systems that are fair, equitable and transparent, such claim remains relative because fairness, equity and transparency may only be a privilege to those within the circle of political friendship and ties in government. In essence, the general view held on the relationship between politics and government administration is that, there are alternative approachesto provide government administration that is neutral and objective to the politics ofthe country. The research question to be answered in this article is whether the South African government may have sound alternative approaches towards separating their government administration from their subjective party political agenda. This article argues, however, that South Africa's claim of fair, equitable and objectively practised public administration free from political persecution of the opposition is a myth which started with the Mandela's reconciliatory public administration through the Mbeki's depoliticized bureaucracy and the current politicized bureaucracy of the Zuma administration. A fair public administration free from political interferences and interventions is likely not to exist even in the most highly respected democratic states of the globe.",,,,,,,,"(2011) Death of UDM Deputy President Ntopile Kganyago, , www.ANC.Polity.org, ANC Parliamentary Caucus, Available online, Accessed on 18/10/2013; Barber, J., Vickers, B., South Africa's foreign policy (2001) Government and politics in the new South Africa, , In Venter, A(ed), Pretoria: J.

Such reforms require strong political support because of their potentially significant medium-term impact on winners and losers in the Indonesian economy. Although REDD+ in Indonesia has strong rhetorical presidential backing, analysis of the political system suggests that such support may not be sufficient without the engagement and ownership of key players such as the parliament and the bureaucracy. Not only is the president's official power curtailed by the formal political system, but the nature of coalition politics in Indonesia further weakens his ability to implement reforms. Securing the support of a coalition of parties within parliament and the bureaucracy at both national and decentralised levels may be crucial to ensuring implementation. Politicisation of the bureaucracy and increasing business-government relationships are important features of the parliamentary dynamic at the national level and are reportedly intensifying at the local level. Although public support has proved influential for other reforms in Indonesia, the public is less informed or motivated by the issues related to REDD+. In addition, the REDD+ debate is tainted by concerns about sovereignty and lack of national ownership. Building domestic constituencies for the reforms and associated institutions is therefore a key challenge. REDD+ reforms will require a stronger consensus among political elites and the broader public over the implications of a transition to a 'low carbon' economy in Indonesia. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Forest sector; Indonesia; Policy actors; Political economy; REDD+; Reform process","article; carbon footprint; consensus; decision making; deforestation; economic aspect; economic development; environmental planning; forest management; government; human; Indonesia; land use; organization and management; politics; priority journal; public figure; public relations; public-private partnership",,,,,"David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Direktoratet for Utviklingssamarbeid, NORAD; European Commission, EC; Department for International Development, DFID","Abidin, S.Z., Pertumbuhan ekonomi dan kemiskinan di Indonesia (2011) Detik News, 24 (FEBRUARY). , http://us.detiknews.com/read/2011/02/24/111758/1578166/103/pertumbuhan-ekonomi-dan-kemiskinan-di-indonesia, (accessed 10.12.11); Adam, C., Dercon, S., The political economy of development: an assessment (2009) Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 25, pp. 173-189; (2010) Joint Chiefs?, 21 (DECEMBER). , http://www.asiaviews.org/index.php%3Foption=com_content%26view=article%26id=4597%3Acolcomalias561%26catid=3%3Acolumn-a-commentaries%26Itemid=10, Asia Views, (accessed 8.12.11); Aspinall, E., (2005) Opposing Suharto: Compromise, Resistance, and Regime Change in Indonesia, , Stanford University Press, Palo Alto, CA; (2010) Problems of Democratisation in Indonesia: Elections, Institutions and Society, , Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore, E.

The assumptions of disorder and a lack of institutional strength that mark understandings of the postcolonial African state may thus appear appropriate to the analysis of the negotiation of power and authority within the Zimbabwean state. A focus on a politics of disorder does not, however, further our insights into the practical and conceptual place of law and judicial institutions in Zimbabwe. Examining the dynamics within one state institution, the Attorney General's office, I explore the circumstances under which, and the manner in which, the office was politicised, and how those working in or with the office made sense of this process. Officials invoked two registers, one of corruption and politicisation and another of professionalism and 'justice', to explain their experiences with, and expectations of, the Attorney General's office. These views highlight the centrality of contestations over the nature of the judiciary in the imagination of Zimbabwe's state by civil servants, rather than simply demonstrating a weakened, disordered, or hollowed-out state institution. © 2013 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.",,"corruption; political relations; political system; post-colonialism; power relations; Zimbabwe",,,,,,"Comaroff, J.L., Colonialism, Culture and the Law: A Foreword (2001) Law and Social Inquiry, 26 (2), pp. 305-314; Chanock, M., (1985) Law, Custom and Social Order: The Colonial Experience In Malawi and Zambia, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Falk, M.S., (1986) Social Facts and Fabrications: Customary Law On Kilimanjaro, 1880-1980, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Mann, K., Roberts, R., (1991) Law In Colonial Africa, , eds, London, James Currey; Merry, S.E., Legal Pluralism (1988) Law and Society Review, 22 (5), pp. 869-896; Zimudzi, T.B., African Women, Violent Crime and the Criminal Law in Colonial Zimbabwe, 1900-1952 (2004) Journal of Southern African Studies, 30 (3), pp. 499-517; Cooper, F., Stoler, A.L., (1997) Tensions of Empire: Colonial Cultures In a Bourgeois World, , London, University of California Press; Berman, B., Structure and Process in the Bureaucratic States of Colonial Africa (1992) Unhappy Valley: Conflict In Kenya and Africa, p. 141. , in B.

And yet the aftermath of September 11 has opened the door to a reassessment of the role of a skilled civil service in the survival and viability of democratic society. Here, Ezra Suleiman offers a timely and powerful corrective to the widespread view that bureaucracy is the source of democracy's ills. This is a book as much about good governance as it is about bureaucratic organizations. Suleiman asks: Is democratic governance hindered without an effective instrument in the hands of the legitimately elected political leadership? Is a professional bureaucracy required for developing but not for maintaining a democratic state? Why has a reform movement arisen in recent years championing the gradual dismantling of bureaucracy, and what are the consequences? Suleiman undertakes a comparative analysis of the drive toward a civil service grounded in the New Public Management. He argues that ""government reinvention"" has limited bureaucracy's capacity to adequately serve the public good. All bureaucracies have been under political pressure in recent years to reduce not only their size but also their effectiveness, and all have experienced growing deprofessionalism and politicization. He compares the impact of this evolution in both democratic societies and societies struggling to consolidate democratic institutions. Dismantling Democratic States cautions that our failure to acknowledge the role of an effective bureaucracy in building and preserving democratic political systems threatens the survival of democracy itself. © 2003 by Princeton University Press.

Upon joining the workforce in the late 1930s, most cotton mill hands were young, uneducated women expected to endure hard work and remain physically confined to the factories. By 1945, women workers were at the forefront of a militant labour movement, writing manifestoes and petitioning government officials. This process of politicization stemmed from their decision to work in factories, which breached societal norms, and their experience of disciplined labour regimes and brutal working conditions, which fostered an incipient class-consciousness. Moreover, Nationalist-sponsored factory education campaigns had the unintended effect of leading women to challenge class exploitation and sexual discrimination. Their participation in the labour movement, which was fuelled by their struggle for economic justice and desire for higher social status, used both legal forms - especially petitions and letters to the press couched in the wartime nationalist rhetoric of shared sacrifice - and extralegal means, namely class violence. The paper concludes that the social changes and conflict that accompanied women's wartime work helped prepare the terrain for Communist rule.

A targeted selection and recruitment system is a prerequisite for the whole administration to act in compliance with the political priorities of the government. However, civil servants and top officials alike must put professional competencies above political loyalty. Therefore, a new system was introduced in Slovenia following the 2003 Civil Servants Act, aimed at ensuring professionalism against (over)politicization of public administration. A research carried out in 2012 among candidates and selected top officials and ministers, as their political superiors, revealed an overall efficiency of the Slovenian selection scheme in the sense of restricted over-politicization and increased professionalism. Its outcomes lead to the conclusion that the selection system in Slovenia, owing to its two-phase professional and political selection, is most adequate in terms of both regulation and practice since it takes into account the twofold role of top officials and civil service or public administration as a whole (first, as a force providing professional solutions by ensuring legality and efficient resource management, and second, as the closest collaborators of the political leadership implementing government policies).","Management; Politiciza-tion; Professionalism; Public administration; Research; Selection; Slovenia; Top officials",,,,,,,"Aberbach, D.J., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians In Western Democracies, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Almendares, N., 'Politicization of Bureaucracy' (2011) International Encyclopedia of Political Science, pp. 2064-2067. , in Badie, B., Berg-Schlosser, D. and, Thousand Oaks: Sage; Bevir, M., (2011) The Sage Handbook of Governance, , Los Angeles: Sage Publications; Bossaert, D., Demmke, C., (2003) Civil Services In the Accession States: New Trends and the Impact of The Integration Process, , Maastricht: EIPA; Brezovšek, M., Haček, M., (2004) Upravna Kultura [Administrative Culture], , Ljubljana: Faculty of Social Sciences; Farnham, D., Horton, S., (1996) Managing People In the Public Services, , London: Mac-millan Press; Flynn, N., Strehl, F., (1996) Public Sector Management In Europe, , Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall; Haček, M., 'The Commitment of Senior Civil Servants to Democratic Freedoms and Equality' (2012) Transylvanian Review of Administrative Sciences, 35 E, pp. 93-106; Halligan, J., 'Leadership and the Senior Service from a Comparative Perspective' (2005) Handbook of Public Administration, pp. 98-108. , in Peters, B.G. and Pierre, J.

Under socialism, the state became omnipresent, regulating many aspects of the life of its citizens, and thus ceased to be distant. After 1989, the state in SEE has remained big and has become weak. It has been unable to counter organized crime and to provide better services to the people. A few small case studies illustrate these claims. The Bulgarian public administration used to be very politicized even before the rise of the Communist Party to power. Since the transition to democracy, administrative reform has been very slow, while extreme politicization has continued. However, in the late 1990s new laws reorganizing the administration were passed. The case of Yugoslavia is different, particularly since this is a federal state. Under Milosevic, the administration as a whole became very rigid and, in many instances, corrupted. Kosovo has been administered partly by the local government and partly by UNMIK. The cases of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Kosovo share some common traits, related to the problematic selection, compensation and training of civil servants. Administrative reform should primarily address the issue of corruption and should also be linked to the strengthening of democratic institutions, including the access of citizens to state services. © 2002 Frank Cass & Co.

It locates the Irish state within a broader imperial context showing how Ireland contributed to the wider British imperial project. In particular, this article looks at the development of an efficient tax-gathering apparatus, showing how the revenue board, the most pervasive agency of the eighteenth-century Irish state, extracted increasing levels of taxation from a sometimes hostile population. Drawing extensively on the records of the Irish revenue commissioners, a very rich if under utilized source, it demonstrates for the first time the levels of taxation raised in Ireland, while also exploring how these taxes were collected. It concludes that this period saw the expansion of an increasingly professional bureaucracy, challenging existing interpretations that have focused predominantly on politicization. The final section looks at issues of evasion and compliance, showing the difficulties faced by the Irish state in this period, as it expanded deeper into Irish society.

Whereas institutional approaches, most often in (comparative) public administration, identify features of politico-administrative systems to account for policy-making such as politicization or the role of the centre, policy perspectives explain policy-making by factors related to the respective policy domain, e.g. frames or agenda-setting. This divide becomes crucial in the analysis of policy advice. On the one hand, advisory systems are affected by features of politico-administrative systems because bureaucrats represent important sources of advice to ministers. On theother hand, advisory systems also vary across policy domains. The paper aims to reconcile the two approaches by analyzing the constitution of policy advisory systems as affected by both institutional and policy factors. The article argues that the composition and role of advisory systems and their components basically depend upon how the problem structure of a given policy domain prompts the involved actors to use the institutional context to impose their specific problem perception, and hence to determine the relevant knowledge in policy advice. Hence, the paper focuses on the question which institutional and policy-level factors affect the constitution of the policy advisory system in climate policy-making in German federal government. © 2013 Thurid Hustedt.","Central government; Climate policy; Policy advice",,,,,,,"Bach, T., Döhler, M., (2012) Mandated science and the problem of neutral expertise - The case of governmental research agencies, , Discussion Paper SP III 2012-602, Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung; Beck, S., Kuhlicke, C., Görg, C., (2009) Climate policy integration, coherence, and governance in Germany, , PEER Climate Initiative UFZ-Bericht 01/2009; Beuermann, C., Jäger, J., Climate change politics in Germany: How long will any double dividend last?

What accounts for their adoption? We develop and test a model of bureaucratic reforms under repeated partisan competition. In the model, two political parties composed of overlapping generations of candidates compete for office. Under a spoils system, an incumbent politician can either continue to ""politicize"" the bureaucracy, which allows her to direct benefits to voters in a way that will increase her electoral prospects, or she can ""insulate"" the bureaucracy, which prevents all future winners from using the bureaucracy for electoral advantage. Our main result is that politicization persists when incumbents expect to win, and insulation takes place when they expect to lose. We test this hypothesis using data from the adoption of civil service reforms across the U.S. states.

Based on extensive empirical research and statistical data, this article provides an in-depth analysis of the status and position of administrative managers, which is intended to serve as a test whether the apex of the Slovenian administrative system is politicized and in what form. In the so-called new democracies, politicization most often is manifested as a violation of the principles of political neutrality characteristic of a professional civil service, through personalized and biased appointments of senior civil servants and in the low degree of protection against lay-offs of civil servants on political grounds. Administrative managers thus often have to decide between political susceptibility and trustworthiness versus professionalism and professional accountability, for their tasks belong to the administrative and political realms. This poses a question about the degree of influence politicians exert on administrative managers and the rate of success with which administrative managers manage to retain their professionalism and independence, which should represent the key characteristics of a senior civil servant.","Appointment; Policy making; Politicization; Senior civil servant; Slovenia",,,,,,,"Aberbach, D.J., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians In Western Democracies, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Aberbach, D.J., Rockman, B.A., Comparative Administration: Methods, Muddles, and Models (1987) Administration and Society, 18 (4), pp. 473-506; Aberbach, D.J., Rockman, B.A., Image IV.

I discuss early decisions by revolutionary leaders affecting musical activity, a gradual trend toward the politicization of music making in the mid 1960s, changing forms of socialist pedagogy, and I mention a few representative groups of the 1970s and 1980s. The second section considers the musical and extramusical differences between Latino dance music in New York and Havana, and the controversies that the salsa phenomenon has generated within Cuba. The third describes the rapid changes that the Cuban music industry has experienced since the fall of the Soviet Union. After examining the effects of this political crisis on Cuban society, I focus on the decision of government officials to aggressively license Cuban music internationally and to promote increased tourism as a means of expanding the economy, and the impact of these changes on dance musicians. I also document how composers have discussed the realities of present day Cuba. © 2002 by Routledge.",,,,,,,,"Acosta, L., (1996) El capítulo que faltaba: Unos años después., , Unpublished manuscript; Acosta, L., ¿Terminó la polémica sobre la salsa?

Yet, while political scientists have long considered the nature of political systems, the role of institutional structures, and the political contestation of policy issues as central to understanding policy decisions, these issues remain largely unexplored by scholars of evidence-informed policy making. We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies that examined the influence of key features of political systems and institutional mechanisms on evidence use, and contextual factors that may contribute to the politicisation of health evidence. Eligible studies were identified through searches of seven health and social sciences databases, websites of relevant organisations, the British Library database, and manual searches of academic journals. Relevant findings were extracted using a uniform data extraction tool and synthesised by narrative review. 56 studies were selected for inclusion. Relevant political and institutional aspects affecting the use of health evidence included the level of state centralisation and democratisation, the influence of external donors and organisations, the organisation and function of bureaucracies, and the framing of evidence in relation to social norms and values. However, our understanding of such influences remains piecemeal given the limited number of empirical analyses on this subject, the paucity of comparative works, and the limited consideration of political and institutional theory in these studies. This review highlights the need for a more explicit engagement with the political and institutional factors affecting the use of health evidence in decision-making. A more nuanced understanding of evidence use in health policy making requires both additional empirical studies of evidence use, and an engagement with theories and approaches beyond the current remit of public health or knowledge utilisation studies.",,"Africa; attitude to health; decision making; ethics; Europe; health care policy; human; legal aspect; management; politics; public health; review; United States; Africa; Decision Making; Europe; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Policy; Humans; Policy Making; Politics; Public Health; United States",,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 282118",,,,,,,,,19326203,,,"24204823","English","PLoS ONE",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905199775

The presence of robust competition, including coherent governments and critical oppositions are said to reduce the potential for state politicisation. This article challenges this perspective. It concentrates on the impact of patterns of government alternation on senior civil service politicisation. The article emphasises problems of political control of senior bureaucrats, which are argued to emerge after regular wholesale alternations between ideological blocs as opposed to other types of alternations. The article relies on data from an expert survey that was conducted in eight Central and Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004. It develops an index of politicisation that captures the range and intensity of senior civil service politicisation. It then conceptualises senior civil service politicisation as a mode of governing the postcommunist state and traces the variation in politicisation to patterns of government alternation in Central and Eastern Europe since their transition to democracy. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Baltic States; East-Central Europe; Political parties; Post-communism; State-building",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians In Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Calvert, R., Moran, M., Weingast, B., Congressional influence over policy making: The case of the FTC (1987) Congress: Structure and Policy, pp. 493-522. , In: M.D. McCubbins and T.

The article employs the concept of formal-political discretion, as a means of explaining and elucidating the extent to which both the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and current legislation regulating civil service preconditions/pre-favours the politicization of the senior civil service in Kosovo. It first discusses the concept of politicization based upon current scholarship and gives hints on the way in which these concepts fit with both UNMIK and Kosovo's current situation. Next, the article discusses and compares the previous civil service system built by UNMIK with the current one - built in post-independence Kosovo based upon the formal-political discretion model. The article further argues that the former system of civil service - in contrast to the current system - provided less formal-political discretion to political elites with which to politicize the senior civil service. The article concludes by suggesting that the current post-independence legislation regulating the civil service grants the executive institutions a significant level of formal-political discretion in the appointment, dismissal and promotion of civil servants.Points for practitionersThe articles offers a thorough, both theoretical and practical, policy explanation of the model and structure of Kosovo's civil service, hinting on the previous and current legislative gaps that allow for partisan influence and control. The article also portrays the routes via which the politicization of the civil service in Kosovo is being developed, giving insights on how civil servants perceive such a process. Comparing the previous civil service system with the current one, the article informs practitioners on the directions that the new reform on Kosovo's civil service should take. Finally, the article provides in-depth policy information on the means to redesign the key protection mechanisms of Kosovo's senior civil service management. © The Author(s) 2012.","appointment; civil service; dismissal; Kosovo; law; politicization; promotion; reform","civil service; elite politics; political reform; Kosovo; Serbia",,,,,,"Bovaird, T., Russell, K., Civil service reform in the UK, 1999-2005: Revolutionary failure or evolutionary success?

The country's battle for independence, and its history of military dictatorships and dysfunctional democracy, have brought challenges in terms of establishing a sound system of governance. The five pillars of public governance have posed formidable obstacles to establishing and reforming key institutions, refining processes and strategies of management and guiding the country towards a more efficient and effective system. Here we analyse the backgrounds of legislators elected to parliament in 1991, 1996 and 2001, legislative accountability, functional mechanisms, and the constraints of regulatory, administrative and economic institutions in order to examine how poor governance practices have created high levels of patronage in return for short-term political gains. We argue that state institutions have been captured by members of a powerful nexus who have developed a symbiotic relationship with the state, affecting its institutional capacity to reduce corruption, strengthen transparency and accountability, and allow the judiciary and public bureaucracy to work professionally. © 2012 South Asian Studies Association of Australia.","Bangladesh; corruption; Governance; institutions; patronage; politicisation","accountability; bureaucracy; corruption; democracy; governance approach; state role; Bangladesh",,,,,"Ministry of Finance, MOF","Weiss, L., Global governance, national strategies: How industrialized states make room to move under the wto (2005) Review of International Political Economy, 12 (5), pp. 723-749; Weiss, L., The state-augmenting effects of globalisation (2005) New Political Economy, 10 (3), pp. 345-353; Stoker, G., Governance as a theory: Five propositions (1998) International Social Science Journal, 50 (155), pp. 17-28; Pierre, J., Guy Peters, B., (2000) Governance Politics and the State, p. 67. , London: Palgrave Macmillan Press; Hirst, P., Democracy and governance (2000) Debating Governance: Authority, Steering and Democracy, p. 14. , Jon Pierre (ed.), New York: Oxford University Press; Ved, P., Nanda, The ""good governance' concept revisited (2006) The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 603 (1), pp. 269-283; http://mirror.undp.org/magnet/policy/, accessed 24 July 2012; Weiss, L., Developmental states in transition: Adapting, dismantling, innovating, not normalizing (2000) Pacific Review, 13 (1), pp. 21-55; Brinkerhoff, D.W., Goldsmith, A.A., (2000) Participation in Macroeconomic Policy: Experience and Implications for Poverty Reduction Strategies, , Washington DC: World Bank, Oct; Brinkerhoff, D.W., Goldsmith, A.A., Institutional dualism and international development: A revisionist interpretation of good governance (2005) Administration and Society, 37 (2), pp. 199-224; Elias Sarker, A., The new mode of public governance and public accountability in developing countries: An analysis with particular reference to bangladesh (2009) International Journal of Public Administration, 32 (13), pp. 1101-1123; Husain Khan, M., (2009) Building Growth-romoting Governance Capabilities, Background Paper for the Least Developed Countries Report, pp. 1-31. , New York and Geneva: UNCTAD, 2008-09; Alam, Q., The nature of the bangladesh state in the post 1975 period (1993) Contemporary South Asia, 2 (3), pp. 311-325; Alam Majumdar, B., Who got elected to the ninth parliament?

The presence of robust competition, including coherent governments and critical oppositions are said to reduce the potential for state politicisation. This article challenges this perspective. It concentrates on the impact of patterns of government alternation on senior civil service politicisation. The article emphasises problems of political control of senior bureaucrats, which are argued to emerge after regular wholesale alternations between ideological blocs as opposed to other types of alternations. The article relies on data from an expert survey that was conducted in eight Central and Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004. It develops an index of politicisation that captures the range and intensity of senior civil service politicisation. It then conceptualises senior civil service politicisation as a mode of governing the postcommunist state and traces the variation in politicisation to patterns of government alternation in Central and Eastern Europe since their transition to democracy. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Baltic States; East-Central Europe; Political parties; Post-communism; State-building",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians In Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Calvert, R., Moran, M., Weingast, B., Congressional influence over policy making: The case of the FTC (1987) Congress: Structure and Policy, pp. 493-522. , In: M.D. McCubbins and T.

Politicization can generally be defined as the substitution of bureaucratic neutrality by introducing political considerations into the human resource management and behaviour of civil servants. The concepts of direct and professional politicization serve as vantage points for our analysis. The empirical data are taken from documentary analysis and recent online and semi-structured surveys of Commission officials. We show that Commission bureaucrats, although they are highly sensitive to the political side of their job, are less politicized since the Kinnock reforms than before. While the College of the Commission seems to have indeed become more politically responsive to its supranational peers and national governments, the Commission's bureaucracy can be characterized as weakly politicized or, according to current debates, as quite instrumental in a Neo-Weberian sense. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","administrative reform; bureaucratic autonomy; European governance; European Union","administrative reform; autonomy; bureaucracy; European Commission; European Union; governance approach",,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/F037155/1","Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Balint, T., Bauer, M.W., Knill, C., Bureaucratic change in the European administrative space: The case of the European Commission (2008) West European Politics, 31 (4), pp. 677-700; Bauer, M.W., Diffuse anxieties, deprived entrepreneurs: Commission reform and middle management (2008) Journal of European Public Policy, 15 (5), pp. 691-707; Bauer, M.W., Impact of administrative reform of the European Commission: Results from a survey of heads of unit in policy-making directorates (2009) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 75 (3), pp. 459-472; Clifford, C., Wright, V., (1997) The politicisation of the British civil service: Ambitions, limits and conceptual problems, , Unpublished paper, Nuffield College, Oxford, UK; Egeberg, M., (2010) European Union Politics, pp. 125-140. , Cini MBorragán N, ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press; Eichbaum, C., Shaw, R., Revisiting politicization: Political advisers and public servants in Westminster systems (2008) Governance, 21 (3), pp. 337-363; Ellinas, A.A., Suleiman, E.N., Supranationalism in a transnational bureaucracy: The case of the European Commission (2011) Journal of Common Market Studies, 49 (5), pp. 923-947; (2004) Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities, , http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/docs/toc100_en.pdf, European Commission; Grant, C., (1994) Delors: Inside the House that Jacques Built, , London: Nicholas Brealey Publishing; Hooghe, L., Several roads lead to international norms, but few via international socialization: A case study of the European Commission (2005) International Organization, 59 (4), pp. 861-898; Hooghe, L., Images of Europe: How Commission officials conceive their institution's role in the EU (2012) Journal of Common Market Studies, 50 (1), pp. 87-111; Kassim, H., Peterson, J., Bauer, M.W., Connolly, S., Dehousse, R., Hooghe, L., Thompson, A., (2012) The European Commission in Question, , Oxford: Oxford University Press (forthcoming); Mayntz, R., (1984) Bureaucrats and Policy Making: A Comparative Overview, pp. 174-205. , Suleiman EN, ed., New York: Holmes & Meier; Mayntz, R., Derlien, H.U., Party patronage and politicisation of the West German administrative elite 1970-1987 - Toward hybridization?

Very quickly concerns about employment overshadowed those regarding one's career, even though this idea is well entrenched in the French civil service. Elected representatives and directors general of services are interdependent, a relationship which has been redefined. This institutional change gives rise to a new approach to exercising the profession of general director of services.

Although there exists a rich literature on the effects of institutions such as presidents, electoral systems, and bicameralism on government spending, the role of professional bureaucrats has yet to receive formal scrutiny. In the model, legislators bargain over the allocation of distributive benefits across districts. The legislature may either ""politicize"" a program by bargaining directly over pork and bypassing bureaucratic scrutiny, or ""professionalize"" it by letting a bureaucrat approve or reject project funding in each district according to an underlying quality standard. The model predicts that the legislature will professionalize when the expected program quality is high. However, politicization becomes more likely as the number of high-quality projects increases and under divided government. Further, more competent bureaucrats can encourage politicization if the expected program quality is low. Finally, politicized programs are larger than professionalized programs. © 2012 American Political Science Association.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH","Alesina, A., Tabellini, G., Bureaucrats or politicians?

Using the underexploited papers of Richard Scandrett and Marshall MacDuffie, this article explores the story of UNRRA in the Soviet Union and assesses its significance in forging an ethos of international public service and humanitarianism in the United Nations system. I argue that this animating spirit has its roots in the first-hand exposure of UNRRA personnel to the destruction wrought by the war, and in the personal rapport UNRRA officials established with their Soviet counterparts. Meanwhile, a strong reaction against multilaterally administered relief arose in the USA, forcing the organization to vigorously defend its performance. In response, UNRRA staff rejected the politicization of relief and became more committed to the broader goal of strengthening international institutions in order to address global problems. UNRRA staff concluded that the impartiality of international relief work should be protected as a vital asset in alleviating human suffering. As today's humanitarian workers face an increasing threat of violence in places like Afghanistan and Sudan, the lessons on UNRRA's experience are worth remembering. © 2012 The Author(s).","postwar relief; Soviet Union; United Nations; UNRRA",,,,,,,"UNRRA headquarters were staffed overwhelmingly with Americans, although US nationals were less than a sixth of total field staff.

Framing the ongoing process of limiting independence of these agencies as the politics of de-delegation, it raises the question of why Turkish regulatory agencies have become subject to increasing political intervention. Contending that institutional legacies and mounting illiberal predispositions of the Turkish state facilitate the politics of de-delegation, the essay focuses on centralization, executive discretion, and politicization of bureaucracy as the major institutional legacies. Then it briefly discusses formal and informal mechanisms of political intervention, which have impaired the independence of the regulatory agencies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","De-delegation; Delegation; Independence; Regulation; Regulatory agencies; Turkey",,,,,,,"Atiyas, I., Doǧan, P., Glass Half Empty?

Two features of RHPOs in Hungary are particularly striking. First, RHPOs have undergone steep increases since the early 1990s. Yet reward levels for most high public offices remain low compared to private sector salaries. Second, especially the institutional basis of RHPOs in public administration is characterized by instability, discretionary governance and large variable bonuses, which can amount to 50 percent and more of an offi- cial’s take-home salary. Variable pay instruments have typically been introduced under the heading of performance-related pay (PRP). In particular, since 2004 when the businessman Ferenc Gyurcsány was appointed Prime Minister of a Socialist-Liberal government there has been a growing infl uence of new public management ideas on RHPOs in Hungary. The discussion will show however that the Hungarian PRP system is mistrusted by civil servants and vulnerable to politicization. © 2012 Marleen Brans and B.

Our paper shows that, using a strict, but widely applied defi nition of what constitutes a political appointment, agency heads in Slovakia are overwhelmingly “political”, but that the implications of politicisation vary, depending on the type of politicisation. In particular, we distinguish personal nominations of the responsible minister and contrast them with party nominations based on coalition agreements. Based on a series of interviews with senior policy-makers on both sides of the politico-administrative divide, we show that the selection mechanism, incentive structure and robustness of actual accountability mechanisms differs more between these two types of politicisations than between the ministerial and formally “non-political” appointment. © 2012, Versita.

Detailed assessment of reform content is presented with the highlight on respondents' attitude towards different aspects of reform ( in the areas of civil servants recruitment, work organization of selection committees, career management, change of leadership roles, performance evaluation). According to the distribution of respondents' answers, the article also reviews the areas where political connections are used the most, and analyses possible changes of the relationship between top-level civil servants and politicians in the process of ongoing reforms. The article is based on the data of quantitative survey carried out on April - May 2011 and qualitative research with top-level public officials and politicians. During the research a questionnaire survey of civil servants was carried out with 400 respondents in total. Moreover, 50 top-level public officials and politicians were interviewed.","Civil service; Civil service reform; Politicization of the civil service",,,,,,,"Aucoin, P., The public service as a learning organization: Maintaining the momentum in public service reform (2000) Modernizing Governance: A Priliminary Exploratio, pp. 147-184. , J.

For healthcare systems these technologies can enable enhanced effectiveness as well as spiralling costs, depending on value-for-money offered. Amidst uncertainty over efficacy and pricing, institutions such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have been set up to regulate the cost-effectiveness of new products. The increased transparency of this new regulation, combined with inescapable uncertainties, leads to the heightened politicisation of decision-making and an insidious subjectivity beneath a veneer of rational-bureaucracy. This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding the infl uence of hope within such contexts. Conceptualised here as ideological, affective and prone to lapsing into trust, hope is considered to shape the lifeworld-background of regulatory decisions and mask uncertainty around effectiveness. These processes challenge regulator legitimacy and effectiveness within polycentric regimes, through the distortion of communication and the manipulation of blame.

However at the same time as British colonial authorities implemented divisive policies, they created one institution necessitating the smooth cooperation between Greek and Turkish Cypriots: the colonial bureaucracy, the structure and function of which remains understudied. Based on the cases of three Cypriots appealing against their dismissal from the colonial civil service, this paper argues that exploring the uncharted world of 'native' employees provides important insights into the inconsistencies underpinning British rule. Indeed, the debates prompted by the dismissal procedures shows that notions such as 'nationality', 'loyalty', 'legality' and 'civilisation' constituting the ideological foundations of colonial rule are rather indeterminate. The article makes a case for the study of subaltern Cypriots as a vantage point to explore the points of articulation and cross-fertilisation between colonial morality and local self-representations.","Colonialism; Interethnic conflict; Microhistory; Subaltern studies",,,,,,,"Apostolides, A., (2010) Economic Growth or Continuing Stagnation?

Specific motivations for this trend may have varied from location to location, but included arguments for higher industrial productivity and less political discontent, often intertwined with a humanitarian impulse in calls for better housing, expanded public health or improved working conditions. As has been well documented, the politicization of the social domain in early twentieth-century Britain owes much to the consolidation of British sociology as a distinct discipline. Yet while the link between the rise of social politics and sociology has been established with regard to Britain, little has been said about the occurrence of this coupling elsewhere in the twentieth-century British Empire. This article aims to rectify that omission by showing the interplay between newly raised social concerns of the colonial administration in the Bombay Presidency, Western British India, and the establishing of sociological research within the borders of the Presidency around the time of the First World War. The article will explore how the colonial administration in Bombay planned to meet new demands for sociological knowledge in colonial state policy, how sociology was subsequently introduced into the Presidency as a research subject, and how new sociological methods were applied in actual colonial government. © Copyright British Society for the History of Science 2010.",,"article; history; human; India; political system; politics; sociology; United Kingdom; war; Colonialism; Great Britain; History, 20th Century; Humans; India; Politics; Sociology; World War I",,,,,,"Cain, P.J., (2002) Hobson and Imperialism: Radicalism, New Liberalism, and Finance 1887-1938, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Rose, N., (1999) Powers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Collini, S., (1979) Liberalism and Sociology: L.T.

The dispute was part of a broader movement against high modernist planning that swept American and Canadian cities in the 1960s and 1970s. Frustrated by unresponsive politicians and civic officials, citizen activists challenged authorities with an alternate vision for cities that prioritized the safeguarding of the urban environment by preserving communities, preventing environmental degradation, and promoting public transit. By the latter half of the 1960s, citizen activists were no longer fighting alone, as some politicians and civil servants also turned against more traditional modes of city planning. This politicization of urban planning and transportation schemes culminated in the defeat of expressway networks in cities across Canada and the United States, including the Spadina Expressway in 1971.

Following the new paradigm of famine analysis where focus is placed on political failures, the article addresses three groups of political dynamics that together contributed to the starvation deaths: (i) political triggering mechanisms; (ii) underlying political dynamics; and (iii) village specific political dynamics. The article finds that the government's escalating conflict with the Maoists turned a situation of chronic food insecurity into an acute hunger crisis, which was not mitigated by effective public policies at the local level due to extensive political patronage and a politicisation of the bureaucracy. Amlashol suffered disproportionally from this due to the village's affiliation with a weak and politically marginalised panchayat. Within Amlashol, the casualties of starvation came primarily from one particular Scheduled tribe, the Sabars, due to issues of social stigmatisation, political exclusion and eroding livelihoods. The article provides a testament to the importance of addressing disaggregated political dynamics in contemporary starvation analysis. © 2011 SAGE Publications India Private Limited.","Amlashol; local political dynamics; Starvation deaths; West Bengal",,,,,,,"Five Die in Belpahari Village Due to Starvation and Malnutrition (2004) Anandabazar Patrika, , (loosely translated).10 July; Buddha Orders Inquiry on Starvation Deaths and 30 Doctors Despatched to Amlasol (2004) Anandabazar Patrika, , Minister (Maheswar Murmu) Given the Charge but is yet to Start Probe (loosely translated). 11 July; Party and Administration Desperate to Hide Truth; and Starvation Situation in Amlasol, Admits Buddha (2004) Anandabazar Patrika, , (loosely translated). 12 July; How can We Recognise You, do You Come to Our Village; We dont have Food, Give us Food, Amlasol Tells Minister Maheswar; and The Minister Visits Amlasol for the First Time after the News of Starvation Deaths (2004) Anandabazar Patrika, , (loosely translated). 13 July; (2006) India Human Rights Report 2006-West Bengal, , http://www.achrweb.org/reports/india/AR06/WB.htm, Asian Centre for Human Rights.

However, it has also been easily dismissed by those investigating recent US foreign policy, as in the Robb- Silberman Commission's assurance over the 2003 Iraq War that 'the Intelligence Community needs to be pushed'. This essay seeks an extension of the critique of politicization by considering the historical context since the formation of the CIA. It seeks an application of that critique by putting forth, when evaluating the policy and operations of the George W. Bush administration, the notion of an 'alternative network' within the government. The argument is that politicization must be linked to a conception of 'Executive power', both within the American bureaucracy and in the projection and rationalization of US aims overseas. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,"(2005), http://www.gpoaccess.gov/wmd/pdf/full_wmd_report.pdf, Transmittal Letter to the President, Report of The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction [henceforth Robb-Silberman Report], 31 March, accessed 18 August 2009; Thielmann, G., Leung, R., The man who knew (2004) CBS News, , http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/14/60II/main577975.shtml, Amidst former Bush administration officials, see, for example, 4 February, accessed 18 November 2009; Pillar, P., Intelligence, foreign policy, and the war in iraq (2006) Foreign Affairs, 85 (2). , http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61503/paul-r-pillar/intelligence-policyand-the-war-in-iraq, accessed 10 August 2008; Drumheller, T., Thomas, G., Debate over prewar intelligence on iraq heats up again (2007) GlobalSecurity.org, , http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2007/intell-070521-voa01.htm, 21 May, accessed 18 August 2009; Prados, J., (2004) Hoodwinked: The Documents That Reveal How the Bush Administration Sold Us a War, , Scholarship includes, New York: New Press; James, R., (2006) State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and The Bush Administration, , New York: Free Press; Bamford, J., (2004) A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and The Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies, , New York: Doubleday; (2010) Interview: Douglas feith Defends Bush Policies, , http://www.rferl.org/content/Interview_Douglas_Feith_Defends_Bush_Policies/2220476.html, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 26 November, accessed 17 December 2010; Betts, R., (2007) Enemies of Intelligence: Knowledge and Power In American National Security, p. 74. , New York: Columbia University Press; Jervis, R., Reports, politics, and intelligence failures: The case of iraq (2006) Journal of Strategic Studies, 29 (1), pp. 3-52. , February; Pillar, P., Who was the CIA's national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia from 2000 to 2005, exposes Jervis's artificial distinction: 'The Bush administration deviated from the professional standard not only in using policy to drive intelligence, but also in aggressively using intelligence to win public support for its decision to go to war.

Although it is now an independent state, various Hindu kings, Muslim emperors, British lords and zamindars of the Indian subcontinent ruled the area of Bangladesh for several hundred years. In 1947, when India and Pakistan emerged as independent states, Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan. To understand the growth and development of bureaucracy in Bangladesh, the article is divided into two broad sections: the colonial legacy of both British India and Pakistan (1601-1971) and the Bangladesh period (1971-2008). The structure and working patterns of bureaucracy in Bangladesh are a legacy of British colonial rule, which impeded reform efforts after Independence and caused politicisation of the administration and governance. Civil-military elitisms reduced accountability of the administration, resulting in a dominating bureaucratic structure with corruption. © 2011 ICSAC.","administrative reforms; Bangladesh; British India; bureaucracy; civil service; colonial rule; corruption; East Pakistan; elitism; governance; government; military rule; politicisation","accountability; administrative framework; bureaucracy; civil service; civil-military relationship; colonial legacy; colonialism; corruption; governance approach; historical perspective; institutional framework; political development; Bangladesh",,,,,,"Emajuddin, A., (1980) Politics and Bureaucracy in A New Nation: Bangladesh, pp. 149-175. , Khan Mohammad Mohabbat Zafarullah Habib Mohammad, ed.

It also shows how much literature that is relevant to the study of the administrative presidency is being ignored by those who do identify with the study of administrative strategies for advancing presidential policy agendas. It then provides an agenda for future research on the presidentializing of the federal bureaucracy in America. Surveys of federal bureaucrats have advanced the understanding appreciably of the politicization of the Senior Executive Service (SES), and they should continue to play an important role in future research. © The several contributors 2010.

Aiming to reduce the politicization and direct administration of electricity generation, transmission and distribution, the central planners launched three major episodes of institutional changes in the reform era which culminated in the creation of an independent ministry–level agency – SERC – to oversee an oligopoly of restructured power companies in 2002. However, a new regulator operating in face of powerful state–owned firms is bound to open a new chapter in contentious politics. Resistance to an arms-length regulatory relationship has come from the bureaucratic and market levels. We argue that the influential role of NDRC has undercut the institutional role and autonomy of SERC, while domestic players have been hampered in their growth strategies by lack of clarity in rules of competition. As a result, they have focused their efforts on crowding out the private sector and foreign investors, and lobbying around SERC for particularistic gains. We conclude by comparing the power sector to oil and petrochemicals, telecommunications, and transport sectors, deriving that even in a highly-authoritarian political environment, the domestic diffusion of regulatory institutions has manifestly produced different forms of governance with troubling implications for industry–specific regulatory bodies and peak associations. © 2011 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Contrary to previous findings, the article argues that type of higher education is not a key determinant of variations in technocratic mentality among elite bureaucrats; instead, post-socialization provides a better explanation. One suggested post-socialization mechanism is politicisation, so the more politicized a ministry is, the less technocratic the mentality of the bureaucrats working in it. These suggestions are tested empirically by both re-analysing Putnam's data from the late 1970s and analysing data from a total survey of elite bureaucrats working in the Government Offices of Sweden. As well as demonstrating that the 'type of training hypothesis' is poorly supported, the empirical analysis demonstrates that the technocratic mentality of bureaucrats varies depending on ministerial affiliation. Furthermore, the level of politicisation is connected to the degree of technocratic mentality among the bureaucrats, though not exactly as hypothesized: more politicisation indeed leads to higher 'tolerance for politics' among bureaucrats but, counter intuitively, also makes bureaucrats more likely to advocate neutrality rather than political advocacy among civil servants. © The Author(s), 2011.","bureaucrat; education; politicisation; socialization; technocracy; technocratic mentality",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bailey, D.J., Misperceiving Matters: Elite Ideas and the Failure of the European Constitution (2008) Comparative European Politics, 6 (1), pp. 33-60; Cheng, L., White, L., Elite Transformation and Modern Change in Mainland China and Taiwan: Empirical Data and the Theory of Technocracy (1990) The China Quarterly, 121, pp. 1-35; Christensen, T., Bureaucratic Roles: Political Loyalty and Professional Autonomy (1991) Scandinavian Political Studies, 14 (4), pp. 303-320; Clarence, E., Technocracy Reinvented: The New Evidence Based Policy Movement (2002) Public Policy and Administration, 17 (3), pp. 1-11; Dahlström, C., Effects of Politicisation on Welfare State Policies: Comparing Policy Impacts of Politically Appointed Officials in 18 Mature Democracies (2008) QoG Working Paper Series, 3. , The Quality of Government Institute.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on review and analysis of published documents and data and information obtained on field visits to Bangladesh. Findings: The administrative system in Bangladesh is driven by complex rules and procedures with weak institutional support. Internal mechanisms of accountability in administrative organizations have become ineffective due to existing political, economic and social conditions. Therefore, the external mechanisms of accountability must be strengthened to ensure good governance in Bangladesh. Social implications: A weak system of accountability renders the task of public management difficult and the establishment of good governance unattainable. Improvements in social conditions can be expected with the strengthening of accountability mechanisms. Originality/value: The value of this paper lies in the identification of factors such as institutional disharmony, politicization and corruption as the most formidable barriers to accountability and good governance in Bangladesh. It presents a fresh analysis of the factors and points to the potentials for improvement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bangladesh; Bureaucracy; Governance; Parliament",,,,,,,"Ackerman, J., Co-governance for accountability: Beyond 'exit' and 'voice' (2004) World Development, 32, pp. 447-463; Ahamed, E., (1988) Military Rule and the Myth of Democracy, , University Press Limited, Dhaka; Ahmad, M.M., The State, laws and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Bangladesh (2001) The International Journal of Not-for-Profit Law, 3. , www.icnl.org/knowledge/ijnl/vol3iss3/art_1.htm, available at; Ahmed, N., Ahmed, A., The quest for accountability: Parliament and public administration in Bangladesh (1996) Asian Journal of Public Administration, 18, pp. 70-95; Ahmed, N., Khan, S., The development of parliamentary oversight in Bangladesh: A research note (1995) Legislative Studies Quarterly, 20, pp. 573-583; Ali, A.M.M.S., (2004) Bangladesh Civil Service: A Political-Administrative Perspective, , University Press Limited, Dhaka; (1997) Governance: Promoting Sound Development Management, , Asian Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Manila; Blair, H.W., Civil society, democratic development and international donors (2001) Bangladesh: Promise and Performance, pp. 181-217. , Jahan, R.

From the standpoint of institutional or social history, this network of relationships is not limited to high level political actors, but involves constantly changing alliances of high ranking scientists with politicians, industrialists, military men or civil servants acting in the relevant government agencies. In addition, and much more important, this relational history involves - or has led to - basic changes in the content of both politics and science. At this level we can speak of two complementary processes: an increasing scientification of politics on the one hand - meaning the tendency to treat political projects as technocratically solvable problems - and a politicization of science on the other hand - meaning the tendency to take on the scientific topics and research issues that appear to be presented by political projects and administrative programmes. Thus, scientists in the twentieth, as well as the twenty-first centuries have not only been servants of politics or opportunists taking the chances that politics appears to offer; often enough they have played significant parts in the formulation and execution of political projects. Examples of all this come from all fields of scientific knowledge. Not only for the natural, medical and technical sciences, but also the social sciences and humanities the statement holds, that this relational history cannot be reduced to the ideologization of supposed value neutral science.",,,,,,,,"Von Humboldt, W., Über die innere und äußere Organisation der höheren wissenschaftlichen Anstalten zu Berlin [1809] (1990) Gelegentliche Gedanken Über Universitäten, pp. 273-283. , Ernst Müller (Hrsg.), Leipzig, hier: S. 274; Vom Bruch, R., Die Gründung der Berliner Universität (2001) Humboldt International.

As a result the offending sentence was removed from the preface and the surrounding paragraph rewritten, despite enormous costs to the publisher: the book was already in print, awaiting distribution. This incident, which came to be known as the ""affair of the sentence"" (delo predlozheniia, Etkind 1978:111), suggests how translation - not only the practice of translation but also commentary on translation - became a site of resistance to official Soviet culture and values. Through the selection of texts for translation, the various choices made in the course of translation, and commentary on translation in the form of footnotes, prefaces, and reviews, literary translators in the Soviet period became adept at encoding resistance for a select intelligentsia audience. Moreover, the successful decoding of subversive content automatically constructed the reader as more insightful, if not more intelligent, than the censor, who functioned as a metonym for the entire Soviet bureaucracy. In those situations where knowledge of a foreign language was necessary to fully decode the oppositional message, even more cultural capital accrued to the reader, all of which lent support to the intelligentsia's claims to cultural leadership. The use of translated literature as a vehicle to comment critically on contemporary society formed part of what Vladimir Shlapentokh referred to as a ""second culture,"" or an intelligentsia subculture within Soviet society. This second culture, Shlapentokh explains, ""to some degree parallels the 'second economy' created by people far from the intellectual stratum. Both the second culture and second economy serve to undermine the state's monopoly in several vital spheres"" (1990:75). This second culture, which has parallels with the Renaissance topos of literature as an idealized ""second government,"" functioned to create and to socially reproduce Russia's creative or ""moral"" intelligentsia. The concept of the intelligentsia that I am using here has deep roots in Russian society and goes far beyond one's level of education, although that is an essential attribute of members of the Russian intelligentsia. It supposes, in Shlapentokh's formulation, ""that a member of the intelligentsia or an intellectual is one who possesses a cluster of intellectual, cultural, and, most importantly, moral virtues such as kindness and altruism, and who serves as a model for the rest of society"" (1990:ix). Also crucial in the Soviet period was an oppositional mood. As Masha Gessen points out, ""the intelligentsia drew its identity in part from its relationship to and its distance from the regime"" (1997:7). The successful decoding of oppositional content (re)produced the individual reader as a member of an alternative ""reading public,"" situated within official Soviet literary culture. This oppositional stance may in fact be the most significant aspect of the intelligentsia's resistance, for, as Lev Loseff points out, the messages encoded in these texts did not contain any new or vital information: they ""tell the reader nothing which the reader would not have known beforehand without [the author's] help"" (1984:219). Loseff argues that ""again and again in a society where ideological censorship prevails, the reader will animatedly follow this dangerous game in which intellect bests authority; again and again the reader will participate, albeit passively, in the game, not analyzing or responding emotionally to the text, so much as celebrating it as he would a mythical ritual"" (1984:222-23). To the extent that this mythical ritual was shared by many readers, it served, as rituals often do, to create a common group identity, an ersatz community, that was defined by its intellect and its ""oppositional mood,"" among other things (Shlapentokh 1990:83). ""The coding and decoding of artistic works,"" Shlapentokh noted in 1990, ""has become an important element of intellectual activity in the U.S.S.R. and is a common topic for conversation at social gatherings"" (66). On a symbolic level in this context, literary translators came to embody resistance, especially during the worst periods of repression. In part through that resistance, the Soviet-era intelligentsia bolstered its ""claim on the spiritual leadership of society"" (Shlapentokh 1990:122). What was perceived and celebrated in intelligentsia circles as translators' selfless devotion to the ""word"" and to the genius of individual artists was put forward as an alternative to the active, collective heroism of socialist realism. By devoting themselves to the preservation of the ""classics of world literature"" for a Russian reading public, literary translators perpetuated the concepts of timeless ""universal values"" and ""world culture"" that were in opposition to what they saw as the tendentious, politicized, and class-based official culture of the Soviet Union. In fact studies of the tastes of Soviet readers reveal that the nineteenth-century ""classics"" of Russian literature and translated foreign literature were always significantly more popular than original Soviet literature, largely because they were perceived to be ""nonpolitical"" (Friedberg 1962:168). The intelligentsia sought to create a subculture that was distant and distinct from ""everything official, officially approved, officially ideological"" (Gudkov 1995:171). The intelligentsia's resistance to Soviet culture, which Etkind insists was ""not clearly dissident in character (1978:1), was an attempt to ""protect"" literature from politicization and to preserve an appreciation of the formal innovation and moral complexity of literary works at a time when literary scholars in the West were insisting on the impossibility of separating ideology from the study of literary forms and themes. In other words, when post-structuralism was leading literary scholars in Europe and North America to ""deconstruct"" literature's pretensions to eternal esthetic and moral values, members of the Russian literary intelligentsia were struggling to support those very pretensions. For this reason the resistance of the Russian intelligentsia appears to the Western observer to be culturally conservative, while it was nonetheless politically daring. Such resistance was seen by the intelligentsia not so much as political but as moral or even spiritual in nature. As Joseph Brodsky put it, ""Art is a form of resistance to the imperfection of reality as well as an attempt to create an alternative reality, an alternative that one hopes will possess all the hallmarks of a conceivable, if not achievable, perfection"" (1992:221).

Studies of politicization of public services are important because political involvement in management has often led to negative effects on service delivery. The article sets out a theoretical framework for political-administrative relationships, examining the growing politicization of public services, the impact of New Public Management (NPM) and political-administrative relationships in developing countries. It then looks at political-administrative relationships in South Africa, including the apartheid history, the development of a new framework in the democratic South Africa and politicization in the staffing of the public service. It examines three functional areas - the decentralization of powers, contract appointments and performance management - and discusses the implications of this changing framework for service delivery. The methodology consisted of interviews with a number of senior government officials, including three current directors-general and a former Minister for the Public Service and Administration, an analysis of government legislation, Public Service Commission (PSC) data including surveys, unpublished data of the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA), policy papers of the African National Congress (ANC) and an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study of political involvement in bureaucracies. The article concludes that growing politicization of the public service has contributed to poor service delivery, and that the South African government needs to place greater emphasis on merit as the basis for appointments and promotions. Points for practitioners This article is useful for professionals working in public management and administration because it looks at the following debates and issues, which have practical implications: frameworks for understanding political-administrative relationships in the public service; the impact of the politicization of staff in the public service; and how merit-based appointment can improve government effectiveness. The article also offers lessons to developing countries wishing to create more professional public services. © 2010 The Author(s).","bureaucracy; merit appointment; partisan control of bureaucracy; political-administrative relationships; politicization; public sector reform","administrative framework; administrative reform; bureaucracy; developing world; legislation; OECD; political integration; public administration; public service; service provision; South Africa",,,,,,"Adair, B., Albertyn, C., Restructuring management in the public service: Implications for new legislation (2000) Public Service Labour Relations in a Democratic South Africa, pp. 110-125. , In: Adler G (ed.), Johannesburg: Wits University Press; Adamolekun, L., How administrative competence contributes to better development performance (2004), Paper presented at the Annual Conference of the International Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration (IASIA), Seoul, 12-16 July; Aucoin, P., Beyond the 'new' in public management reform in Canada: Catching the next wave?

This model has been challenged by politicization, changes in career management and recruitment as well as increasing competition from other sources of policy advice. The UK civil service's role in relation to ministers seems to have become increasingly defined in managerial terms and decreasingly as policy advisers, not least because a range of other individuals and bodies (advisers, consultants, think tanks, party research departments) now share this role. While it appears to be enjoying a diminishing policy role, the senior civil service has not, at least so far, managed to occupy the high ground in its managerial role. The biggest change in the model is a collapse of confidence in the civil service, not only among citizens, but also among politicians and civil servants themselves. © The Author(s) 2010.","central administration; civil service","administrative framework; civil service; heuristics; party politics; political geography; public administration; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Blick, P., (2004) People Who Live in the Dark: The History of the Special Adviser in British Politics, , London: Politicos; (1970) The Reorganisation of Central Government (Cm 4505), , Cabinet Office, London: HMSO; (1994) The Civil Service: Continuity and Change (Cm 2627), , Cabinet Office, London: HMSO; (1999) Modernising Government (Cm 4310), , Cabinet Office, London: HMSO; (2003) The Government's Response to the Ninth Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 5964), , Cabinet Office, London: HMSO; (2006) Capability Review of the Home Office, , Cabinet Office, July, London: Cabinet Office; Campbell, C., Wilson, G., (1995) The End of Whitehall: Death of a Paradigm?, , Oxford: Blackwell; Carmichael, P., The Northern Ireland Civil Service: Characteristics and trends since 1970 (2002) Public Administration, 80 (1), pp. 23-49; Cline, A.W., The modernisation of british government in historical perspective (2008) Parliamentary Affairs, 61 (1), pp. 144-159; (2009) The Balance of Power: Central and Local Government Sixth Report HC33-1, , Communities and Local Government Committee, House of Commons, London: HMSO; Flinders, M., Shifting the balance?

Bush presidency was not its formal management reform agenda, but its attempt to extend the politicized presidency. Efforts to assert tighter political control of the federal bureaucracy, revived during the Ronald Reagan administration, were pursued to an extreme under Bush. Loyalty triumphed over competence in selection, and political goals displaced rationality in decision making. However, the strategy of politicization undermined the Bush administration's own policy goals as well as its broader agenda to restore the strength of the institutional presidency. This apparent failure of strategy signals the urgent necessity for a fundamental reconsideration of the politicized presidency.

Informal approval of corrupt activities in exchange for loyalty and compliance with the regime was commonplace in the former Soviet Union. This article explains how corrupt regimes maximize their position in terms of loyalty and compliance using the example of the 2004 presidential elections in Ukraine, which later became known as the Orange Revolution. The 2010 presidential elections and their aftermath pose new challenges to those aspiring to power.

Looking at the European Employment Strategy and the Lisbon Agenda, it shows that more has been accomplished than is often realised. It argues that the OMC's apparent fragility reflects an intrinsic tension, termed here the 'soft-law dilemma': it must ensure a constant supply of items to feed the EU agenda, whilst at the same time guaranteeing a level of institutional stability sufficient to allow effective policy delivery. To maintain both legitimacy and effectiveness, the OMC has learned to navigate between the extremes of all-out policy activism and bureaucratisation. As a result, the OMC has become an established form of socio-economic governance at EU level. A decade later, EU actors have the resources to take action in areas long associated with national sovereignty, thereby widening the scope and potential for a politicisation of the EU. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",,"bureaucracy; European Union; governance approach; institutional framework; labor policy; policy implementation; regional policy; regional politics; socioeconomic indicator; sovereignty; strategic approach; Europe",,,,,,"Armstrong, K., The Open Method of Coordination - Governance after Lisbon (2006) Special Issue of Journal of Contemporary European Research, 2 (1), pp. 1-104; Armstrong, K., Begg, I., Zeitlin, J., EU Governance after Lisbon (2008) Jcms Symposium, Journal of Common Market Studies, 46, pp. 413-450; Ashiagbod, D., (2005) The European Employment Strategy, Labour Market Regulation and New Governance, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Aubin, C., Comment Bruxelles traite du social: L'exemple de la stratégie européenne pour l'emploi (1999) Revue Franc ̧aise Des Affaires Sociales, 53 (3-4), pp. 107-123; Barbier, J.C., La stratégie européenne pour l'emploi: Génèse, coordination communautaire et diversite nationalé Rapport De Recherche Pour La Dares, , (Ministère du travail de la France); Barbier, J.C., Research on ""Open Methods of Coordination"" and National Social Policies: What Sociological Theories and Methods?

These nations share a common administrative style and bureaucratic culture, which flow from their imperial legacy. However, a quick mapping expedition reveals the presence and resilience of the classical administrative style of India, which continued to be present until the end of the 12 th Century, in spite of repeated invasions from Alexander the Great to those of the Scythians, Huns, Afghans and Turks. This was modified somewhat when Mohamed Ghuri established Muslim rule in the region. Thereafter, the five centuries of Muslim governance were followed by 200 years of British rule. Thus, there emerged, in South Asia, a high degree of convergence between the ancient Hindu culture and subsequent Islamic and Christian values systems. As a consequence of this, the administrative tradition of India and its neighbours shows three distinct characteristics: persistence from classical times, convergence with the Islamic and Christian mores and patterns, as well as some divergence in the wake of independence. This chapter examines these features. It also explores the challenges which the countries of the region face today. Foremost among them are politicisation of the bureaucracy, the need to fight corruption and the difficulty of reforming entrenched bureaucratic procedures. The chapter concludes by suggesting that, despite these daunting challenges, the process of modernisation is slowly taking hold and opening new prospects for a vibrant, inclusive and empowered India and neighbouring South Asian states. © 2009 IIAS.

It examines in detail four interrelated features of Westminster systems: firstly, the increasing centralization in collective, responsible cabinet government; second, the constitutional convention of ministerial and collective responsibility; third, the role of a professional, non-partisan public service; and finally, parliament's relationship to the executive. The book explains the changes that have occurred in the Westminster model by analyzing four traditions: royal prerogative, responsible government, constitutional bureaucracy, and representative government. It suggests that each tradition has a recurring dilemma, between centralization and decentralization, party government and ministerial responsibility, professionalization and politicization, and finally elitism and participation. The chapter goes on to argue that these dilemmas recur in four present-day debates: the growth of prime ministerial power, the decline in individual and collective ministerial accountability, politicization of the public service, and executive dominance of the legislature. It concludes by identifying five meanings of, or narratives about, Westminster. Firstly, 'Westminster as heritage' - elite actors' shared governmental narrative understood as both precedents and nostalgia. Second, 'Westminster as political tool' - the expedient cloak worn by governments and politicians to defend themselves and criticize opponents. Third, 'Westminster as legitimizing tradition' - providing legitimacy and a context for elite actions, serving as a point of reference to navigate this uncertain world. Fourth, 'Westminster as institutional category' - a useful descriptor of a loose family of governments with shared origins and characteristics. Finally, 'Westminster as an effective political system' -a more effective and efficient political system than consensual parliamentary governments. Westminster is a flexible family of ideas that is useful for many purposes and survives, even thrives, because of its meaning in use to elite actors. © R. A. W.

'Civic watch' from below allows people to monitor elites and organizations in order to make their actions more transparent, fair and accountable. The use of information and communication technologies increases the ability of people to publish information regarding the unethical behaviour or mishandling of governments, civil servants, public office holders, the police, etc. We study the individualized civic watch facilitated by computer-mediated communication in the frame of reflexive political action. Reflexive politics refers to politicized personal matters and it departs on the basis of individualized responsibility-taking. The Internet provides a cheap tool that empowers an individual and offers an opportunity to create personal news deliverance that influences mainstream news providers and the media. The individualized use of the Internet stresses the new forms of political activity that might cause the renaissance of personalized politicization. Through the Internet it is possible to offer 'official truth challenging' viewpoints on political campaigns and gain access to more personalized information than ever before, which may even reach a global audience. In regard to that we study individualized usage of the Internet. Such innovative forms of action are, for instance, Web blogging and multi-directional narrow-/broadcasting through YouTube. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Blogging; Computer-mediated communication; Individualized civic watch; Public spheres; Reflexive politics; Youtube",,,,,,,"Atton, C., (2004) An Alternative Internet: Radical Media, Politics and Creativity, , Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh; Bennett, L.W., Communicating global activism: Strengths and vulnerabilities of networked politics (2004) Cyberprotest: New Media, Citizens and Social Movement, pp. 123-146. , edsW. v. d.

Bush's tenure in office with which President Barack Obama must now contend. We argue that the hyper-politicization of personnel decision-making during the presidency of George W. Bush left many parts of the federal bureaucracy understaffed, yet more densely populated by staffers chosen more for ideological and political congruence than administrative competence. For President Obama to achieve key aspects of his policy agenda, he must first attend to fixing these staffing problems and then to reforming the personnel process to prevent similar problems from plaguing future presidential administrations.","Executive; Neutral competence; Politicization; Presidency; Vacancies",,,,,,,"Eilperin, J., Leonnig, C.D., Administration moves to protect key appointees (2008) Washington Post, A, p. 1. , November 18, p; Gaudin, S., (2007) Homeland Security Vacancies Called enormous, , http://www.informationweek.com/news/global-cio/showArticle.jhtml?articleID-201000218, Retrieved July 9, 2007, from; Heclo, H., OMB and the presidency - The problem of neutral competence (1975) Public Interest, 38, pp. 80-98. , Winter; Hsu, S.S., Job vacancies at DHS said to hurt U.S. preparedness (2007) Washington Post, A, p. 1. , July 9; Moe, T.M., The politicized presidency (1985) The New Direction in American Politics, pp. 235-271. , J.

The authors argue that presidential concern with agency output is dynamic and is in part conditioned by the president's relationship with the public. To assess the relationship between politicization and public opinion, the authors use a data set that combines information on presidential efforts to politicize the Council of Economic Advisers from 1989 to 2004 with that of public attitudes concerning the president's handling of the economy. Their results indicate that public opinion does indeed bear a marginal, yet statistically significant, influence on presidential efforts to manage the federal bureaucracy, thus, providing a new contribution to the debate concerning presidents and the politics of bureaucratic structure. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Politicization; President; Public opinion; Staffing",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., The political views of U.S. senior federal executives, 1970-1992 (1995) Journal of Politics, 57, pp. 838-852; Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., (2000) In the Web of Politics: Three Decades of the U.S. Federal Executive, , Washington, DC: Brookings Institution; Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., From Nixon's problem to Reagan's achievement: The federal executive re-examined (1990) Looking Back on the Reagan presidency, pp. 175-194. , (with Copeland, R.

Corruption and inefficiency are also common, but their extent is debatable. During democratic transition and consolidation, Southern European bureaucracies were not ""cleansed"" from collaborators of the authoritarian regimes. In the period of democratic persistence, most attempts at implementing public management reforms in Southern Europe failed. However, decentralization progressed immensely it Italy and Spain, but hardly in Greece and Portugal. Except for Spain, professionalism was not achieved. Even though extensive politicization persists, the traditional features of South European bureaucracies have started fading. © Oxford University Press, 2014.","Administrative elites; Corruption; Democratic persistence; Inefficiency; Political clientelism; Politicization; Reform failure",,,,,,,,,,"Oxford University Press",,,,,,9780191708008; 9780199202812,,,"English","Democr. and the State in the New South.

This study aimed to investigate views on academic culture, values, and routines held by faculty members. A nation-wide survey conducted in six public medical schools in Iran. The research findings show weak organizational culture and values, together with routine behaviors sensed as a negative and low satisfaction with academic leadership. The research evidence suggests bureaucracy, politicization, conservativeness, and centralization as common features of medical schools in Iran and also suggests suitable supervisory skills to tackle the tension between governmental management and academic leadership with cultural changes, the creation of new values, and adoption more efficient routines. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Academic culture;

Yet local bureaucratic elites, sitting as they do between central states and localities, are key actors in governance networks. In England, the role and responsibilities of local bureaucratic elites has been transformed since the days of professionalized officers heading departmental structures reporting to committees, firstly by NPM and politicization in the 1980s and 1990s and, more recently, by political management reform introducing a separation of powers. Drawing on interviews in 15 local authorities, this paper examines the changing narratives and dilemmas of local government elites. In particular it explores, but argues against, early expectations that the creation of an elected executive, with considerable devolution of decision-making responsibilities to individual cabinet member councillors, has meant a move closer to the logics of the 'Whitehall mandarin' tradition by local government chief officers. © Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"bureaucracy; decision making; local government; political development; political reform; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,"Ackroyd, S., Kirkpatrick, I., Walker, R., 'Public Management Reform in the UK and its Consequences for Professional Organization: A Comparative Analysis' (2007) Public Administration, 85 (1), pp. 9-26; Bevir, M., Rhodes, R.A.W., (2003) Interpreting British Governance, , London: Taylor and Francis; Bevir, M., Rhodes, R.A.W., 'Interpretive Approaches to British Government and Politics' (2006) British Politics, 1 (1), pp. 84-112; Bevir, M., Rhodes, R.A.W., 'Disaggregating Structures as an Agenda for Critical Realism: A Reply to McAnulla' (2006) British Politics, 1 (3), pp. 397-403; Bevir, M., 'New Labour in Time' (2007) Parliamentary Affairs, 60 (2), pp. 332-340; Bevir, M., Rhodes, R.A.W., (2003) Interpreting British Governance, , London: Taylor and Francis; Borraz, O., John, P., 'The Transformation of Urban Political Leadership in Western Europe' (2004) International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 28 (1), pp. 107-120; Byrne, T., (1992) Local Government in Britain, , London: Penguin; Chandler, J., (2001) Local Government Today, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Clarke, K., Gains, F., 'Constructing Delivery: Implementation as an Interpreted Process' (2007) Critical Policy Analysis, 1 (2), pp. 133-138; Copus, C., (2004) Party Politics and Local Government, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Denters, B., Rose, L., (2005) Comparing Local Governance: Trends and Developments, , Basingstoke: Palgrave; Fox, P., Leach, S., (1999) Officers and Members in the New Democratic Structures, , London: Local Government Information Unit; Finlayson, A., 'The Interpretive Approach in Political Science: A Symposium' (2004) British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 6 (2), pp. 129-164; Fox, P., Lyons, M., Skelcher, C., (2002) Continuity or Change?

Although all funds for the first programming period 2004-6 were allocated, the process did not occur without problems. Therefore, in our paper we point to the weaknesses of the system and some of the crucial barriers that hindered efficient fund allocation: faulty institutional and legal framework, bureaucracy, corruption and personnel deficits. We base our findings on research of interviews carried out in four regions of Poland. Referring to Niklas Luhmann's theory of autopoietic system, we sketch an image of an unevenly differentiated political system, in which administration and politics prevail over the underdeveloped and weak public, incapable of counteracting trends of politicization and expanded.","Administration; Bureaucracy; Corruption; Eufunds; European integration; Niklas luhmann; Political system; Politicization; Systems theory",,,,,,,"Baldersheim, H., Swianiewicz, P., The Institutional Performance of Polish Regions in an Enlarged EU: How Much Potential?

Although all funds earmarked for the first programming period 2004-2006 were allocated, the process posed certain problems. Therefore, in our paper we point to the weaknesses of the system and some of the hindrances to efficient fund allocation: faulty institutional and legal framework, bureaucracy, corruption and personnel deficits. We base our findings on a research incorporating 150 in-depth interviews carried out in four regions of Poland. Referring to Niklas Luhmann's theory of autopoietic systems, we present a sketch of an unevenly differentiated political system, in which administration and politics prevail over the underprivileged public, incapable of counteracting trends of politicization and bureaucratization. By showing the evolution and reproduction of the system, we relate to its deficits and their impact on the future use of the EU funds inflow.","Administration; Bureaucracy; Corruption; EU funds; European integration; Niklas Luhmann; Political system; Systems theory",,,,,,,"Harald, B., Swianiewicz, P., (2003) The Institutional Performance of Polish Regions in an Enlarged EU: How Much Potential?

The empirical data shows that the Commission started as a public administration in the Continental tradition and over time partially moved towards the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian models. At the same time, the majority of the member states remained rather stable with regard to their position along the two administrative dimensions under study. We argue that none of the mechanisms commonly invoked to explain organisational change - functional adaptation, path dependency, isomorphism or policy windows - can convincingly account for the complete pattern and the magnitude of change that we observe in the case of the European Commission. While we find no convincing support for the relevance of functional adaptation or path dependency, the concepts of isomorphism and policy windows provide a more promising basis for understanding at least some aspects of the empirical development.",,"bureaucracy; European Commission; European Union; policy making; public administration",,,,,,"Ahrens, G., Die Reform des EU-Beamtenstatuts - Eine unendliche Geschichte vor dem Abschluss?

Issues such as the nature of control in governance, the discourse of de-politicization in justifying e-government and the reinvention of the state via electronic means are examined. Analysis of data collected over several years shows that e-government systems are primarily used to centralize control in the hands of the upper echelons of the bureaucracy, a strong discourse of technology and 'high modernism' permeates the justification for deploying e-government and this effectively de-politicizes the intent and purpose of the project. The paper concludes that through e-government the state reinvents itself, as the e-State, as a powerful, centralized force that disrupts historical practices and relations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.",,"Administrative data processing; Control systems; Analysis of data; Case analysis; E governments; E-government systems; Electronic government; International conferences; Government data processing",,,,,,"Heeks, R., Bailur, S., (2007) Analyzing e-government research: Perspectives, philosophies, theories, methods, and practice, 24, pp. 243-265. , Government Information Quarterly; Prakash, A., De', R., Importance of developement context in ICT4D projects: A study of computerization of land records in India (2007) Information Technology & People, 20, pp. 262-281; Scott, J.C., (1998) Seeing like a state: How certain schemes to improve the human condistion have failed, , Yale University Press, New Haven; Vanaik, A., (1990) The Painful Transition: Bourgeois Democracy in India, , Verso, New York; Khilnani, S., (1997) The Idea of India, , Penguin Books; Walsham, G., Sahay, S., GIS for district-level administration in India: Problems and opportunities (1999) MIS Quarterly, 23, pp. 39-66; Ferguson, J., The Anti-Politics Machine: Development (1990) Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Escobar, A., (1995) Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Harriss, J., (2001) Depoliticizing Development: The World Bank and Social Capital, , Leftword Books; Joshi, S., (1992) Struggle for Hegemony in India 1920-47, , Sage Publications, New Delhi; Kamat, S., (2002) Development Hegemony: NGOs and the State in India, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Yin, R.K., Case Study Research: Design and Methods (2003) Applied Social Science Research Methods Series, 5. , Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks; De', R.: Evaluation of e-government systems: Project assessment vs development assessment.

Drawing on survey of senior New Zealand civil servants, this article examines the degree to which political advisers are perceived as a threat to civil service neutrality and describes the form taken by that threat as variously perceived. On the evidence reported, it is suggested that traditional understandings of ""politicization"" need to be reconceptualized if they are to fully account for the nature of the relationship between political and civil service advisers. To existing conceptions of politicization, therefore, the article proposes adding another: ""administrative politicization,"" allowing for different gradations of politicization to be identified, and enabling a nuanced assessment of the nature and extent of a risk to civil service neutrality that, the data suggest, is not as great as is sometimes alleged. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,,"Blick, A., (2004) People Who Live in the Dark., , London: Politicos Publishing; Bowman, J.S., West, J.P., Civil Service Reform Today: Symposium Introduction (2006) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 26 (2), pp. 99-101; Campbell, C., Wilson, G.K., (1995) The End of Whitehall.

During the last two decades, medical education in Iran has shifted from elite to mass education, with a considerable increase in number of schools, faculties, and programs. Because of this transformation, it is a good case now to explore academic leadership in a non-western country. The objective of this study was to explore the views on effective academic leadership requirements held by key informants in Iran's medical education system. Methods. A nominal group study was conducted by strategic sampling in which participants were requested to discuss and report on requirements for academic leadership, suggestions and barriers. Written notes from the discussions were transcribed and subjected to content analysis. Results. Six themes of effective academic leadership emerged: 1)shared vision, goal, and strategy, 2) teaching and research leadership, 3) fair and efficient management, 4) mutual trust and respect, 5) development and recognition, and 6) transformational leadership. Current Iranian academic leadership suffers from lack of meritocracy, conservative leaders, politicization, bureaucracy, and belief in misconceptions. Conclusion. The structure of the Iranian medical university system is not supportive of effective academic leadership. However, participants' views on effective academic leadership are in line with what is also found in the western literature, that is, if the managers could create the premises for a supportive and transformational leadership, they could generate mutual trust and respect in academia and increase scientific production. © 2008 Bikmoradi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; controlled study; human; Iran; leadership; medical education; medical school; recognition; trust; leadership; management; medical school; organization and management; politics; standard; Education, Medical; Faculty, Medical; Humans; Institutional Management Teams; Iran; Leadership; Politics; Schools, Medical",,,,,"Ministry of Health and Medical Education, MOHME","Rowley, D.J., Sherman, H., The special challenges of academic leadership (2003) Management Decision, 41 (10), pp. 1058-1063. , 10.1108/00251740310509580; Pounder, J., Organizational effectiveness in higher education: Managerial implications of a Hong Kong study (1999) Educational Management Administration & Leadership, 27 (4), pp. 398-400. , 10.1177/0263211X990274006; Birnbaum, R., Academic leadership at the millennium: Politic or porcelain?

Contemporary demands for responsive public management contain two emotional injunctions to public bureaucrats. The first, derived from populist doctrines of political right, requires bureaucrats to be responsive to the needs of their 'clients'. In the name of 'recognition' and the 'politics of care', for example, it is thought vital to inculcate in bureaucratic conduct a sense of 'compassion' or close identification with others' feelings. Secondly, in the name of responsiveness to political superiors and the delivery of their policy objectives, bureaucrats are expected to exhibit 'ownership' of and identification with particular policies. They are required to be committed champions for and enthusiastic advocates of those policies. Both of these injunctions are deemed to be more in tune with democratic principles and the currents of contemporary ethical culture ('diversity' or 'human rights', for example) than what is represented as the unlamented Weberian world of rule-bound hierarchy. The paper seeks to question this assessment.

This article begins by stressing the importance of the conventional distinction between 'grand' and 'petty' corruption, not least because each solicits rather different policies of containment. Focusing upon petty corruption it is argued that current efforts at containment are still strongly influenced by the Weberian concept of rational-legal bureaucracy (RLB) and that a configuration close to RLB continues to be widely regarded as the necessary and likely destination of administrative reform. This despite the fact that there does not seem to be a clear view as to the distinctive components of this 'bureaucracy'. In particular the discourse of development administration tends not to take account of the significance for bureaucracies of informal networks. Accordingly, this article moves on to examine the inter-relationship between formal and informal manifestations focusing particularly upon the politicisation of 'bureaucratic' relations. Given the apparently high levels of politicisation of the administrative apparatus in sub-Saharan Africa, what are the prospects for its reform and ultimately the containment of petty corruption?",,"administrative reform; bureaucracy; corruption; political reform; political relations; Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,,,"All eyes on Phumzile (2005) Africa Confidential, 47 (9), pp. 1-3. , Afr Con; Anthony, P., (1994) Managing Culture, , Open University Press, Buckingham; Barratt Brown, M., (1995) Africa's Choices, , Penguin Books, Harmondsworth; Bayart, J.-F., (1993) The State in Africa.

We construct a dynamic model in which bureaucrats may invest in (relationship-specific) policy expertise and may or may not be interested in policy choices per se. The legislature makes sequentially rational grants of discretion, which serve as incentives for expertise investment and continued service only for policy-motivated bureaucrats. Bureaucratic policy preferences and the legislature's agency problem vis-à-vis bureaucracies develop endogenously in the model. Bureaucratic expertise can be supported in equilibrium only at a cost of its politicization; ""neutral competence"" is inconsistent with strategic incentives of bureaucrats. We identify several conditions that support the development of an expert bureaucracy in equilibrium, including security of job tenure and control over policy issues for policy-motivated bureaucrats. © 2007, Midwest Political Science Association.",,,,,,,,"Aberbach, J., (1990) Keeping A Watchful Eye., , Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution; Aberbach, J., Rockman, B., (2000) In the Web of Politics: Three Decades of the U.S. Federal Executive., , and.

In doing so, the Hungarian system is analyzed from two angles. Firstly, regulation is scrutinized as it is manifested in the Civil Service Act. Secondly, practice is examined relying on available statistical and survey data. The author argues that, contrary to the conclusions of most of scholarly publications, the Hungarian Law is a pseudo-merit system law, not in fact preventing the prevalence of a spoils system. Practice generally reveals, however, features of a modestly politicized system with signs of increasing professionalization. The last two sections investigate the potential explanations for these somewhat surprising findings and whether the findings for the Hungarian civil service may be generalized to some or most of the Central and East European countries. © 2007 The Regents of the University of California.","Central and Eastern Europe; Civil servants; Civil service; Hungary; Post-communist countries",,,,,,,"Bekke, H.A.G.M., Meer, F.M., West European civil service systems: variations and similarities (2000) Civil Service Systems in Western Europe, , Bekke H.A.G.M., and Meer F.M.

The study finds that, although both categories of the Eritrean civil servants (ex and non-ex-fighters) have been working together since independence, ex-fighter civil servants were given special privileges in a number of human resource management (HRM) practices, such as recruitment and selection, placement, promotion, training and compensation. That is, the political involvement in the management of the ex-fighter civil servants was considerable, which in turn has led to a certain degree of politicisation in the civil service. The Eritrean experience draws a number of lessons with regard to process, treatment within the workplace and different perceptions on the part of the two categories of civil servant.

Advocates argued that these types of partnership would increase the state's capacities to target the needs of niche populations, strengthen associational sectors and democratise state bureaucracies. However, several studies have shown that state-initiated partnerships often fall well short of their desired objectives and often cause more harm than good for the associational sectors of cities. This paper assesses the problems of the associationalist project through France's politique de la ville. The paper suggests that the outcomes of 'associationalism from above' in France have largely been unintended. State officials operating in good faith sought to foster partnerships that would generate benefits for the state and the associational sector. However, as state officials, they were obliged to impose a bureaucratic infrastructure to co-ordinate complex partnerships and ensure a degree of uniformity across France. Associations found that they not only had to conform to new bureaucratic requirements but also they had to respond to an increasingly political funding system. Thus, bureaucratisation triggered the politicisation of the associational sector, compelling associations to professionalise, politicise, and individualise their practices.",,"bureaucracy; partnership approach; policy development; urban area; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe",,,,,,"(1988) Contrat De Ville Pour L'agglomération Toulousaine: Étude D'ensemble, , Agence Urbain De L'Agglomeration Toulousain (AUAT).

A study of the ministerial bureaucracy reveals that the passing of public administration reforms has not provided an effective constraint against politicization, and that the politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy has increased over time in terms of extent, intensity and scope. Comparison of four post-communist governments in Hungary permits one to relate the politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy to the desire of governing parties to enhance their political control over the formulation and implementation of public policies under conditions of polarized political competition between former communists and their political allies, on the one side, and anti-communist parties, on the other.",,"bureaucracy; conflict management; party politics; political change; post-communism; state role; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Hungary",,,,,,"O'Dwyer, C., 'Runaway State Building: How Political Parties Shape States in Postcommunist Eastern Europe' (2004) World Politics, 56, pp. 520-553. , See (p.521); Grzymala-Busse, A., 'Party Competition and the Pace of State Reform' (2003) The Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, , As argued by paper prepared for presentation at Philadelphia, PA, 27-31 Aug; Grzymala-Busse, A., 'Political Competition and the Politicization of the State in East Central Europe' (2003) Comparative Political Studies, 36 (10), pp. 1123-1147; O'Dwyer, C., 'Runaway State Building'; Shefter, M., 'Party and Patronage: Germany, England and Italy' (1977) Politics and Society, 7 (4), pp. 403-452. , See; Guy Peters, B., Pierre, J., (2004) Politicization of the Civil Service in Comparative Perspective, p. 2. , Quoted from (eds.)

Carefully chosen instruments of new public management reform such as budgeting for results and performance management have been accompanied by an agenda of wholesale restructuring of the bureaucracy. However, these instruments do not include many familiar items of the public management reform agenda. The reforms are best viewed as part of a politicisation strategy aimed at asserting political control at the centre. Managerial reforms are being deployed to reshape the bureaucracy into an instrument of the Thaksin government's political program. In the process, the traditional power of the bureaucracy is being challenged and undermined. The longer-term impact of the bureaucratic modernisation program on administrative performance is less certain.","Administrative reform; Management; New public; Politicisation; Thailand; Thaksin Shinawatra",,,,,,"City University of Hong Kong, CityU: 720018","Arghiros, D., (2001) Democracy, Development and Decentralisation in Provincial Thailand, , Richmond: Curzon; Bidhya, B., ""Administrative Reform and the Politician-Bureaucrat Perspective: Vision, Processes and Support for Reform"" (1999) Handbook of Comparative Public Administration in the Asia-Pacific, pp. 69-78. , H.S.

During that period, three dynamics contributed to the notion of the administration as a ""public problem"". The press increasingly decried bureaucracy, devoting page after page to the only remedy for it, administrative reform. This made for a publicising and ""socialising"" of administrative matters, previously shaped only by internal issues of the state apparatus. During the same period, the administration also became a subject of political importance, at the core of a two-sided electoral competition with rightand left-wing programmes. Inherent in this politicisation was the demand for greater control of the administration by elected representatives. Then, New Public Management and its neo-liberal recipes began making their way to top-level administration and feeding into various reform positions, as testified to by the writings of high-level civil servants published in the 1970s. These partially independent but nonetheless interwoven elements continued to shape and naturalise ""state reform"", the critical attention paid to the functioning and arcane complexities of administrative machinery. © Ecole Nationale d'Administration.

Il valorise le contrôle de l'administration par la mutualité et les processus de participation. Cf. Hood (C.), The Art of the State.

Pour sa signification symbolique, on peut également rappeler que Valéry Giscard d'Estaing a appelé à voter «non» au référendum de 1969; Sur cette thèse, Gaïti (B.), «Des ressources politiques à valeur relative: le difficile retour de Valéry Giscard d'Estaing», Revue française de science politique, 40, 6, 1990, pp. 902-917; Mandrin (J.), L'énarchie ou les mandarins de la société bourgeoise, Paris, Ed. de la Table ronde, 1968 ; Peyrefitte (A.), Le mal français, Paris, Grasset, 1976 ; Club de l'horloge, Le Péril bureaucratique, Paris, Club de l'horloge, 1980 ; Galy (P.), Gérer l'état.

Etude extraite du rapport annuel 1976-1977, Commission du rapport et des études, 1977; Le fonctionnement de l'administration n'est évidemment pas alors seulement considéré comme une question relevant du seul secteur public. Au contraire, les approches de management en plein essor revendiquent de s'appliquer indistinctement aux «organisations». Voir par exemple Hauwel (C.), Penser et résoudre les problèmes administratifs, Paris, les Editions d'organisation, 1975; En 1955 au cabinet de Robert Schuman, garde des Sceaux mais surtout en 1958-1959 auprès de Jacques Soustelle ministre de l'information; Paris, éditions Hommes et techniques, 1975; Il est conseiller technique au cabinet de Philippe Malaud puis de Christian Poncelet (ministres de la Fonction Publique) en 1973-1974; Il s'agit de Jean-Louis Bianco, Thierry Le Roy et François Henrot; Pour une contribution à la fabrication et à la diffusion du nouveau management public en France, voir Bezes (P.) «L'état et les savoirs managériaux: essor et développement de la gestion publique en France» in Lacasse (F.), Verrier (P.-E.), Trente ans de réforme de l'état, Paris, Dunod, 2005, pp. 9-40; Voir par exemple Abate (B.)

Secrétaire d'état auprès du Premier ministre chargé de l'information (1962) puis ministre de l'Information de 1962 à 1966, il est ministre de la recherche scientifique et des questions atomiques et spatiales (1966-1967) puis de l'éducation nationale (1967-1968). Secrétaire général de l'UDR de 1972 à 1973. Son ouvrage Le mal français fait écho, entre autres, à son bref passage au gouvernement comme ministre des Réformes administratives et du Plan (1973-1974). Il sera garde des Sceaux de 1977 à 1981; Jean-Claude Colli, né en 1933, est énarque (1958-1960) et inspecteur des Finances.

Based upon case studies of legislation produced in five 'First Pillar' sectors, the research presented here has explored the submerged, and much larger, part of this institutional 'iceberg': Council working groups. It does so by examining how members of these entities interact with civil servants in COREPER and ministers, on the one hand, and representatives of the Commission and the European Parliament, on the other. Contrary to many practitioner or formalist accounts, the principal finding is that working groups do not operate solely on a 'technical level'. Instead, they are vital arenas through which the ambiguous nature of politics in the European Union heavily influences negotiating processes and legislative outcomes. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.","Commission; COREPER; Council of Ministers; European Parliament; Politicization; Working groups",,,,,,,"Abélès, M., La fonction politique européenne: Acteurs et enjeux (1995) Les Politiques Publiques en Europe, , P.

From the birth of the Spanish Republic in 1931, this difference was testified by the existence of a subsidiary political system – an autonomous regional government which acquired its own parliament and law-making powers in 1932. Within this institutional framework, the interacting pressures of leftist Catalan nationalism, a strong anarcho-syndicalist movement, and the eventual appearance of Marxist parties generated an original political demand which may be called populist. Starting with its overt politicisation in 1901, Catalan nationalism introduced the ideal of a new kind of regional administration. This administration was born of devolution and was carried out in the Catalan language. It was capable of substituting the failing central bureaucracy with the offer of better services (such as education) and of serving as a means of social promotion. Barcelona was the centre of the rise of modern rival corporativisms in Spain, as well as the debate surrounding the viability of civil society (and therefore of civic culture) in the face of state intervention. This had a surprising potential for peculiar (and often contradictory) understandings between the ideological and organisational polarities that developed and matured in the years during and after the First World War. The cultural protectionism of ‘Catalanism’ was offered especially to internal Catalan immigrants from the local countryside to the big city. © Cambridge University Press 2005 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,,,,,,"Cal, E.U.-D., (1979) Estat Català : The Strategies of Separation and Revolution of Catalan Radical Nationalism (1919-1933), , doctoral dissertation, Columbia University, 1979 (Ann Arbor); Cal, E.U.-D., La formació d'Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (1977) L'Avenç, 4, pp. 59-67; del Mar Palomo Escote, M., (1986) ""La Rambla"" i el periodisme de masses a Catalunya, , tesi de llicenciatura, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona; Pujades, X., Santacana, C., (1997) L'esport és notícia: Història de la premsa esportiva a Catalunya (1880-1992), , (Barcelona), chapters 2-3; Aja, T.G., (2002) Sport y autoritarismos: La utilización del deporte por el comunismo y el fascismo, , (Madrid); Burns, J., (1999) Barça, la passió d'un poble, , (Barcelona); Ivern, M.D., (1989) Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (1931-1936), 2, pp. 341-366. , (Barcelona); Molas, I., Les eleccions parcials a Corts Constituents d'octubre del 1931 a la ciutat de Barcelona (1970) Recerques, 1, pp. 201-226; Molas, I., (1974) El sistema de partidos políticos en Catalunã (1931-1936), , (Barcelona); Molas, I., (2000) Diccionari dels partits polítics de Catalunya, segle XX, , (Barcelona); Cal, E.U.-D., (2002) The Shadow of a Doubt: Fascist and Communist Alternatives in Catalonia, Separatism, 1919-1939, , Working Paper 198, Institut de Ciències Polítiques i Socials (Barcelona); Conniff, M.L., (1982) Latin American Populism in Comparative Perspective, , (Albuquerque); Ionescu, G., Gellner, E., (1969) Populism, , (New York); Canovan, M., (1981) Populism, , (London); Taguieff, P.-A., (2002) L'illusion populiste, , (Paris); Joyce, P., (1991) Visions of the People: Industrial England and the Question of Class, 1840-1914, , (Cambridge); Alvarez-Junco, J., (1990) El Emperador del Paralelo.

The U.S. case reveals that the construction of a strong administrative apparatus is an essentially political endeavour that arises out of inter-institutional conflict and an intense engagement between state and society.

However, public management in developing countries is often threatened by politicization and ineffective human resource management policies. In this article, we analyse public management in Eritrea, one of the world's poorest countries that gained independence in the early 1990s. In this analysis, we use general (western) theoretical frames of reference, including pre-modern, weberian and new public management lines of thinking. It will show that, in current Eritrea, all known styles of public management concur and collide and that this situation is related to the cultural, educational and political background of the various population groups that strive for job opportunities in the public sector's strategic apex. This collision of styles may lead to frustration and ineffectiveness among the people involved. Only a managerial policy stressing practical wisdom and intelligence may satisfy all the groups of people engaged in Eritrea's public management, in fact in all developing countries' public organizations.

The inner city was divided into four sectors and through traffic was made impossible by traffic restrictions. Moving by car from one sector to another is possible only via the ring road around the inner city. In this paper it will be explained how this fundamental change could happen. This was a most interesting process since the suspicious public had to be convinced by municipal authorities without having references to successful examples elsewhere. It is illustrated that the most determining factor for success was the availability of political power to neglect opposing views. Both expert involvement (bureaucracy) and citizen participation were reduced to a minimum level.","Groningen; Netherlands; Polarisation; Politicisation; Public participation; Traffic circulation scheme","Bicycles; Construction; Decision making; Public policy; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Groningen; Netherlands; Politicization; Public participation; Traffic circulation scheme; Urban planning",,,,,,"O'Flaherty, C.A., (2001) Transport Planning and Traffic Engineering, , Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford; Chowdhury, M.A., Sadek, A.W., (2003) Fundamental of Intelligent Transportation Systems Planning, , Artech House, Norwood MA; Meyer, M.D., Miller, E.J., (2001) Urban Transportation Planning -A Decision-oriented Approach, , McGraw-Hill, New York (second edition); Flyvbjerg, B., (1998) Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Pharoah, T., Apel, D., (1995) Transport Concepts in European Cities, , Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot; Tsubohara, S., Politicisation, polarisation and public participation -Planning history of groningen, the Netherlands (2003) 1970's □ URSI-report, 302. , Urban and Regional Studies Institute, University of Groningen; Forester, J.F., (1989) Planning in the Face of Power, , University of California Press; Ambrose, P.J., (1994) Urban Process and Power, , Routledge, London; Amstein, S., A ladder of citizen participation (1969) Journal of the American Institute of Planners, pp. 216-223; Woltjer, J., (2000) Consensus Planning, the Relevance of Communicative Planning Theory in Dutch Infrastructure Development, , Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot","Brebbia C.A.Wadhwa L.C.","Wessex Institute of Technology, Southampton, UK",,"Tenth International Conference on Urban Transport and the Environment in the 21st Century, URBAN TRANSPORT X","19 May 2004 through 21 May 2004","Dresden",63612,1462608X,,,,"English","Adv.

It is argued that the logic of policy making has shifted from what can be described as 'the politics of expertise' to a process of 'politicisation'. A process of politicisation can be observed both in terms of the nature of arguments being used, and in terms of who the dominant actors are. The subjects of analysis are issues taken up by the political parties in the Parliament, and the paper focuses on two controversial questions. One is about the localisation of conservation areas on private land and the state's liability for compensation. The other is the question of whether the management of conservation areas, and in particular national parks, should be under the control of local government or the state environmental bureaucracy. The analysis documents a process moving in the direction of more complex governance structure involving more actors and broader local participation challenging the role of the professional bureaucracy. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,"environmental policy; governance approach; nature conservation; policy development; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia",,,,,,"Aasetre, J., (2000) Holdninger Og Kultur I Norsk Naturforvaltning, , Dr.Polit dissertation, Department of Geography, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Trondheim, NTNU); Adler, E., Haas, P.M., Conclusion: Epistemic communities, world order, and the creation of a reflective research program (1992) International Organization, 46 (1), pp. 367-390; Almås, R., (2002) Norges Landbrukshistorie IV. 1920-2000.

Administration, Greece, Department of Organization Studies, Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, United Kingdom","Several critical studies in accounting have approached the introduction of accounting systems in the public sector in terms of enforcing and sustaining competition-based resource allocation mechanisms. In this study, we reverse the question and ask: why has accounting not been used in certain public bureaucracies as much as it might? We investigate the extent to which accounting systems have been used in the management of the Greek National Health System (ESY) and find that accounting has played a marginal role in its development. Attempting to explain this puzzling feature we first note and then contrast the main underlying features of accounting systems with those of the Greek political system in general, and ESY in particular. Briefly, our explanation is that the historically high politicization that has characterized the Greek political system has tended to overshadow the economic-cum-managerial dimension of running public bureaucracies, favouring overtly political evaluation criteria of organizational and individual performance. In such an institutional environment, accounting has low symbolic significance and its use does not contribute to enhancing organizational legitimacy - hence its marginal role.","Accounting systems; Greece; Institution; National Health System; Political system",,,,,,,"Abel-Smith, B., Calltorp, J., Dixon, M., Dunning, A., Evans, R., Holland, W., Jarman, B., Mossialos, E., (1994) Report on the Greek Health Services, , Athens: Farmetrika (in Greek); Broadbent, J., Guthrie, J., Changes in the public sector: A review of recent 'alternative' accounting research (1992) Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 5 (2), pp. 3-31; Carruthers, G.B., Espeland, N.W., Accounting for rationality: Double-entry bookkeeping and the rhetoric of economic rationality (1991) American Journal of Sociology, 97, pp. 31-69; Choudhury, N., The seeking of accounting where it is not: Towards a theory of non-accounting in organization settings (1988) Accounting, Organization and Society, 13, pp. 549-557; Christensen, J.A., Demski, J.S., (2003) Accounting Theory, , McGraw-Hill; Clogg, R., (1995) The Populist Decade: Politics and Society in Greece, 1981-1990, , London: Macmillan; Close, D.H., (2002) Greece Since 1945, , London: Longman; Cooper, R., The visibility of social systems (1989) Operational Research and the Social Sciences, , M.C.

Until the mid-1990s, the former were distinguished from the latter by certain interrelated structural characteristics. These characteristics were extended politicisation of the top administrative ranks; enduring patronage patterns in recruitment to the public sector; uneven distribution of human resources; formalism and legalism; and, with the exception of Spain, absence of a typical European administrative elite. The characteristics were related to the type of capitalism and political development in Southern Europe. South European bureaucracies have started evolving towards decentralisation and privatisation. However, convergence with the bureaucracies of other EU member-states is an open question. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,"bureaucracy; comparative study; European Union; institutional framework; political system; Eurasia; Europe",,,,,,"Alba, C., Politique et administration en Espagne: continuite historique et perspectives (1998) Revue Francaise d' Administration Publique, 86, pp. 229-241; Alba, C., Bureaucratic politics in Spain (2001) Politicians, Bureaucrats and Administrative Reform, pp. 93-105. , B.

The need for organizational learning is high under such circumstances. Conventional theories, however, conceive political involvement as a constraint on organizational learning. This implies a paradoxical challenge for public organizations. On the one hand, the need to learn from mistakes is highest in times of political scrutiny; on the other hand, under such conditions learning is presumed to be most difficult. After studying the effects of politicization on organizational learning in detail, we come to the conclusion that this notion is incomplete at best. Learning in public organizations depends not so much on political involvement as such but, rather, on the specific characteristics of that involvement. Politicians may influence learning processes positively if they commit to structural solutions and encourage the institutionalization of organizational lessons.",,,,,,,,"Argyris, C., Reinforcing organizational defense routines: An unintended human resources activity (1986) Human Resource Management, 25, pp. 541-555; Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., (1996) Organizational Learning II: Theory, Method, and Practice, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., (1993) Agendas and Instability in American Politics, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; (2002) Policy Dynamics, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Birkland, T.A., (1997) After Disaster: Agenda-setting, Public Policy, and Focusing Events, , Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press; Boin, R.A., (2001) Crofting Public Institutions: Leadership in Two Prison Systems, , Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner; Boin, R.A., Otten, M.H.P., Beyond the crisis window of reform: Some ramifications for implementation (1996) Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management, 4, pp. 149-161; Boin, R.A., 'T Hart, P., Institutional crises and reforms in policy sectors (2000) Government Institutions: Effects, Changes and Normative Foundations, pp. 9-31. , ed.

The inner city was divided into four sectors and through traffic was made impossible by traffic restrictions. Moving by car from one sector to another is possible only via the ring road around the inner city. In this paper it will be explained how this fundamental change could happen. This was a most interesting process since the suspicious public had to be convinced by municipal authorities without having references to successful examples elsewhere. It is illustrated that the most determining factor for success was the availability of political power to neglect opposing views.

Of particular significance in this regard are the various indigenous strategies used in contemporary pharmaceutical bioprospecting activities to address claims to traditional medical knowledge as cultural property. This article presents field data on a controversial ethnopharmaceutical project among the Aguaruna of Peru's high forest and offers a comparative analysis of the outcomes with attention to several other cases in and beyond South America. In particular, questions are raised about the forms of legitimating authority in the burgeoning international indigenous movement, the role of NGOs, researchers, bureaucracies, and corporations in this process, and the dilemmas that emerge from the politicization and privatization of indigenous culture and identity. © 2004 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

This article develops a political explanation of why reform oriented central bureaucrats have centralized financial power without liberalizing the banking sector. The starting point of this explanation is that top bureaucrats value political survival as much as other members of the Politburo. Thus, they make policies based on both political and economic considerations. This framework is tested on three cases related to China's non-performing loan (NPL) problem: the politicization of the NPL problem, policies designed to slow me creation of NPLs and policies aimed at decreasing the pool of NPLs. The findings strongly suggest that political considerations play a large role in shaping financial policies in China. © The China Quarterly, 2004.",,"banking; financial provision; fiscal reform; political economy; Asia; China; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; World",,,,,,"Chan, T., ""US$400 billion needed to recapitalize China's banks"" (2001) Standard & Poor's CreditWire, (4). , June This NPL figure represents the approximate mean of estimated NPL ratios by various groups, which range between 30 and 70% of all loans outstanding; Skocpol, T., (1992) Protecting Soldiers and Mothers: The Political Origins of Social Policy in the United States, , (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press); By serious policy alternatives, I mean those proposed by a State Council organ, which should have some notion of which have a reasonable chance of succeeding; Naughton, B., (1996) Growing Out of the Plan: Chinese Economic Reform 1978-1993, , (New York: Cambridge University Press); Baum, R., Mao, B., (1994) Chinese Politics in the Age of Deng Xiaoping, , See, for example, (Princeton: Princeton University Press); Fewsmith, J., (1994) Dilemmas of Reform in China: Political Conflict and Economic Debate, , (Armonk, NY: M.E.

It argues that the communist legacy of over-politicised personnel policy, the mode of transition and the constellation of actors after the first free elections shaped the personnel policy and civil service reform dynamics in the period directly after the change of regime. However, in terms of reform outcomes, the road to de-politicisation of post-communist civil services posed too many obstacles to lead rapidly to successful reforms. Neither governments of the left and the right nor new generations of senior bureaucrats have an incentive to engage in efforts to de-politicise post-communist civil services. The context of post-communist transformation has tended to lock in a pattern of civil service governance that is characterised by high levels of political discretion.",,"civil service; institutional reform; post-communism; reform process; Eurasia; Europe",,,,,,"Ágh, A., The year of early consolidation (1998) Magyarország Politikai Évkönyve, pp. 16-33. , Sándor Kurtán, Péter Sándor and László Vass (eds.), Budapest: Demokrácia Kutatások Magyar Központja Alapítvány; Ágh, A., Early democratic consolidation in Hungary and the Europeanisation of the Hungarian polity (2001) Prospects of Democratic Consolidation in East-Central Europe, pp. 157-179. , Geoffrey Pridham and Attila Ágh (eds.), Manchester: Manchester University Press; Ágh, A., (2002) The Reform of State Administration in Hungary: The Capacity of Core Ministries to Manage the Europeanisation, , Paper presented at the ECPR Joint Meeting, March 2002.

The European Institutions themselves have developed a discourse on civil society and civil dialogue. Institutional interests have shaped this discourse. Reframing the normative context for EU democracy, this discourse suits some institutions better than others. In particular, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Commission have made recourse to it; the former to redefine its proper role and combat the risk of marginalisation within the European institutional set-up; the latter first to build support for policy initiatives in the social sphere and subsequently to respond to the legitimacy crisis of the Brussels’ bureaucracy. These institutional interests have inspired a conceptualisation of civil society as ‘functional participation’ and ‘functional representation’ rather than as ‘politicisation’ or ‘decentralisation’. However, while the Commission and the ESC have had some success in selling their discourse, to be successful in the longer run some problematic assumptions of the discourse should be tackled and both the different rationales for civil society involvement as well as the multi-level character of European civil society and European policymaking should be taken into account. © 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13515993,,,,"English","Euro.

The man-darin status of the administrative elite prevails, despite a long-term decrease in the share of jurists and more open career patterns, both due to a first managerialist turn in the 1970s. It is argued that new administrative policies are carried out like any other substantive policy. On the polity dimension, the bureaucracy's function as the center of expertise is reflected in terms of both formal education and subjective role understanding. On the policy dimension, the 1970 reformist agenda of the Brandt government resulted in higher programmatic commitment than at the point of replication of the base line study in 1987, when the Kohl government was consolidating public finances. Under conditions such as those prevailing after national unification in 1990 and since about 1995, though, top administrators can turn quite managerial. The most significant change is observed on the politics dimension: growing party politicization of the administrative elite, in particular after fundamental government changes (1969, 1982, 1998) examined here. Functional as it may be for streamlining the ministries, the extent of party patronage may, in the long run, undermine the still-high trust in executive institutions in Germany.",,,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Aberbach, J.D., Derlien, H.-U., Mayntz, R., Rockman, B.A., American and West German federal executives: Technocratic and political attitudes (1990) International Social Science Journal, 123, pp. 3-18; Bürklin, W., Machatzke, J., Schnapp, K.-U., Rebenstorf, H., Wenlze, C., Sauerl, M., Kaina, V., (1997) Eliten in Deutschland: Rekrutierung und Integration [Elites in Germany: Recruitment and Integration], , Opladen: Leske + Budrich; Dahrendorf, R., Training an elite: The German upper class and the juridical faculties (1962) Der Monat [The Month], 166, pp. 15-26; Derlien, H.-U., Repercussions of government change on the career civil service in West Germany: The cases of 1969 and 1982 (1988) Governance, 1, pp. 50-78; German unification and bureaucratic transformation (1993) International Political Science Review, 14, pp. 319-334; Germany: The intelligence of bureaucracy in a decentralized polity (1996) Lessons from Experience: Experiential Learning in Administrative Reforms in Eight Democracies, , Johan P.

Bangladesh shows all the symptoms of an underdeveloped polity. Democracy has not been institutionalized. Politics continues to be dominated by big money, goons and people with little background and training in formal politics. Elections have become such an expensive affair that ordinary citizens act only as passive voters. Power and authority are concentrated at the top echelons of government. Corruption has become so endemic that it has engulfed the entire society. Both the supreme leaders of two major political parties, ie the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, were handed top leadership positions for reasons of heredity and kinship. This permanent nature of supreme leadership has thwarted internal democracy in political parties' function and management. The dominant position of the executive is widely known. The parliamentary system that is in existence can best be termed a prime ministerial system. The parliament is content to play second fiddle to the executive. Lack of independence of the judiciary has resulted in its heavy dependence on the executive. Lack of accountability and transparency in the affairs of the state is a major impediment to effective governance. The human rights situation remains unsatisfactory. One of the pressing problems of governance is the politicization of the public bureaucracy, with adverse effects on performance. Expenditure on the military continues to rise without any apparent justification.","Accountability; Corruption; Democracy; Governance; Politicization; Transparency","corruption; democracy; governance approach; state role; Bangladesh",,,,,,"Achariya, J., Democratic party without democracy (2002) Weekly 2000, , 20 December; Aminuzzaman, S.M., Accountability and promotion of ethics and standard of behavior of the public bureaucracy in Bangladesh (1996) Asian Review of Public Administration, 8 (1), pp. 13-27; Blair, H., (1992) The Bangladesh Democracy Program (BOP) Assessment: Final Report, , Washington, DC: Bureau Asia, Democratic Affairs and Special Issues Branch, USAID; (1997) Opinion Survey, 1997, , BUP Dhaka: Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad; Franda, M., (1982) Bangladesh: The First Decade, , New Delhi: South Asian Publishers; Jahan, R., (1992) Governance and Public Policy.

This weight represents the degree of politicization of the government.

Since the 1980s, however, economic liberalisation, multiparty democracy and governance reforms have on the one hand introduced measures conducive to building a legal-rational bureaucracy and a liberal civil society, and on the other accelerated political struggle for economic resources through personalised regional networks. Paraphrasing Emmanuel Terray, the first trend is described in this article as the manufacture of 'air-conditioned' politics, the second as the growth of 'veranda' politics. The article argues that donor reforms are not leading in a straight line to liberal governance, but neither is civil society simply being colonised by patrimonial networks. Rather, both 'air-conditioned' politics and 'veranda' politics are advancing simultaneously, inundating a previously bureaucratised political sphere. The dual character of this 're-politicisation' makes the fate of governance reforms exceedingly difficult to predict.",,"civil society; governance approach; political change; political reform; Tanzania",,,,,,"Allen, C., Understanding African politics (1995) Review of African Political Economy, 65, pp. 301-320; Berman, B., Ethnicity, patronage and the African state: The politics of uncivil nationalism (1998) African Affairs, 97 (388), pp. 305-341; Bienen, H., (1970) Tanzania: Party Transformation and Economic Development, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Boesen, J., Tanzania: From ujamaa to villagisation (1979) Towards Socialism in Tanzania, , B.

In particular, the political accountability of the police impacts on police recordkeeping practices and the statistics regarding ""gangs"" that those records generate. The organizational career of gang statistics, from the citizen's call to the police response and subsequent recordwork, is examined in order to demonstrate how the recordkeeping practices of the police bureaucracy facilitate the social construction of the ""gang"" problem. Field research data, including calls to the police, ride-along observations, and interviews, illustrate how the politicization of the ""gang"" problem impacts on police recordkeeping and the social construction of ""gang statistics."" Given that the current concern about the nationwide growth of gangs is based on such statistics and that gang suppression efforts call for enhancing and sharing gang databases, the role of police practices in shaping gang statistics is an important issue.",,,,,,,,"Alexander, J., Geisen, B., Munch, R., Smelser, N., (1987) The Micro-macro Link, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Best, J., (1995) Images of Issues: Typifying Contemporary Social Problems, , New York: Aldinede Gruyter; Bowditch, C., Getting rid of troublemakers: High school disciplinary procedure-sand the production of dropouts (1993) Social Problems, 40 (4), pp. 493-509; Chambliss, W.J., Policing the ghetto underclass: The politics of law and law enforcement (1994) Social Problems, 41, pp. 177-195; Collins, R., The microfoundations of macrosociology (1981) American Journal of Sociology, 86, pp. 984-1014; Interaction ritual chains, power and property: The micro-macro connection as an empirically based theoretical problem (1987) The Micro-macro Link, pp. 193-206. , edited by Alexander, Geisen, Munch, and Smelser; Curry, G.D., Ball, R.A., Decker, S.H., Estimating the national scope of gang crime from law enforcement data (1996) Gangs in America, pp. 21-38. , edited by Huff; Decker, S., Kempf-Leonard, K., Constructing gangs: The social definition of youth activities (1991) Criminal Justice Policy Review, 5 (4), pp. 271-291; Emerson, R., Case processing and interorganizational knowledge: Detecting the 'real reasons' for referrals (1991) Social Problems, 38, pp. 198-212; Fagan, J., Gangs, drugs and neighborhood change (1996) Gangs in America, pp. 39-74. , edited by Huff; Fine, G.A., On the macrofoundations of microsociology: Constraint and the exterior reality of structure (1991) The Sociological Quarterly, 32, pp. 161-177; Fogelson, R., (1977) Big City Police, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Garfinkel, H., (1967) Studies in Ethnomethodology, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Gill, V., Maynard, D., On labeling in actual interaction: Delivering and receiving diagnoses of developmental disabilities (1995) Social Problems, 42 (1), pp. 11-37; Huff, C.R., (1996) Gangs in America. 2nd Ed., , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Kitsuse, J., Cicourel, A., A note on the use of official statistics (1963) Social Problems, 11, pp. 131-139; Klein, M., (1995) The American Street Gang, , New York: Oxford University Press; Street gangs and deterrence legislation (1996) Three Strikes and You're Out: Vengeance As Public Policy, pp. 203-321. , edited by David Sichor and Dale Sechrist.

This paper examines the nature of these capacity gaps and analyses specifically the factors contributing to the low attraction and retention of local government staff: politicisation of the bureaucracy, excessive use of external experts, excessive state intervention in skill development and low remuneration of local government staff. Against this background, the paper reviews critically a recent capacity building initiative: the establishment of the (new) Institute of Local Government Studies in Accra. Suggestions to improve capacity building for urban management in Ghana are offered. These include the need to prepare a coherent strategy to guide and co-ordinate stakeholder inputs in capacity building; to place training in the context of institutional development; and encourage the development and use of local expertise in donor assisted projects; and, promote merit-based remuneration of local government staff.

Together, they have sought to link practitioners and academicians across subfields and varied levels of activities. As a foremost refereed journal, PAR has sought to encourage the linking of practice and theory through timely publication of methodologically disciplined research, informed analyses and commentaries, and constructive literature reviews and correspondence. These responsibilities have been persistently challenging. ASPA and PAR have served a dynamic field that has made some wrong turns and had others forced on it, resulting in failed autonomy, followed by increasing partisan politicization of governments and reduced reliance on professionally expert administration. For ASPA, it has created leadership and membership problems. For PAR, it has sometimes exacerbated difficulties in connecting practitioners and academicians, but it has also created more shared concerns as important subjects of inquiry. Challenges now are to serve both enduring and new spheres of the field that are afforded by international and domestic developments. Both ASPA and PAR are striving to do that. Globalization of public administration opens a world of opportunities today. Localization, as a fundamental of constitutional democracy, is a priority internationally, presenting an engaging paradox of global attention to both place and planet. That is linked in this commentary to the classic democracy-bureaucracy quandary that has constructively challenged public administration. While arrays of other important subjects, old and new, need to command attention in PAR, these are linked in this analysis to today's theory and practice of interdependent facilitative states to assess how the journal serves its responsibilities.",,,,,,,,"Almond, G.A., Verba, S., (1963) The Civic Culture, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Arnold, D.S., Plant, J.F., (1994) Public Official Associations and State and Local Government, , Fairfax, VA: George Mason University Press; Brown, Brack, Richard, J.S., II, (1986) A Search for Public Administration: The Ideas and Career of Dwight Waldo, , College Station, TX: Texas A&M University Press; Caiden, G.E., Globalizing the theory and practice of public administration (1994) Public Administration in the Global Village, , edited by Jean-Claude Garcia-Zamor and Renu Khator.Westport, CT: Praeger; Considine, M., Lewis, J.M., Governance at ground level: The frontline bureaucrat in the age of markets and networks (1999) Public Administration Review, 59 (6), pp. 467-480; Cook, B.J., (1996) Bureaucracy and Self-government: Reconsidering the Role of Public Administration in American Politics, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; Dasgupta, P., Serageldin, I., (1999) Social Capital: A Multifaceted Perspective, , Washington, DC: World Bank; Dean, A.L., Jasper, H.N., (1997) NAPA, The First 25 Years, , Washington, DC: National Academy of Public Administration; Dimock, M., The restorative qualities of citizenship (1990) Public Administration Review, 50 (1), pp. 21-25; Elkin, S.L., Soltan, K.E., (1993) A New Constitutionalism: Designing Political Institutions for a Good Society, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Farazmand, A., The new world order and global public administration: A critical essay (1994) Public Administration in the Global Village, , edited by Jean-Claude Garcia-Zamor and Renu Khator.
