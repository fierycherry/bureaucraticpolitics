AB The book illustrates the complex relationship between the lobbyists and bureaucrats, often misunderstood by both media and academics. While the term 'lobbying' gives an image of working solely for business interests of certain companies, Laurens provides rather comprehensive insights of interactions between the European institutions and the business communities to share a wide range of information and knowledge - hence, the subtitle 'capitalism's brokers'.

AB The states regulate lobbying based on how they define lobbyists and interest groups, by requiring reporting and disclosure of certain activities, and by prohibiting a number of activities between lobbyists and government officials. These laws are designed to provide accountability and to alter certain political behaviors. For decades, scholars have studied these laws, while a number of good government groups have created their own measures assessing lobby regulations. The result is a multitude of measures that often assess very different constructs. This article creates an updated measure of lobbying regulation and compares this measure to previous and current, alternative measures.

AB EU politics has long been portrayed as an elite affair in which technocratic deliberation prevails. As a consequence, information supply by interest groups has typically been viewed as part of an expertise-based exchange with policy-makers. Less attention has been devoted to whether the supply of information is also used to exert political pressure. In addition to expertise-based exchanges between interest groups and policy-makers, can we identify the prevalence of information supply that aims to put pressure on EU policy-makers? And under what conditions are different modes of information supply likely to occur? My analysis relies on interviews with 143 lobbyists who were active on a set of 78 legislative proposals submitted by the European Commission between 2008 and 2010. The results demonstrate that expertise-based exchanges are dominant in interactions with civil servants, while political information is predominantly communicated to political officials and often the key substance in outside lobbying tactics.

AB One of the most important demonstrations of power in Washington is the ability to recruit sitting government officials to become active proponents of one's position. Many have suggested money is the key: Campaign contributions buy friends, access, and perhaps even policy activism. We provide an alternative view based on a deceptively simple observation: Lobbyists rarely lobby alone. We show empirically that government policymakers respond to the overall structure of conflict, not the resources of individual lobbying groups. Our project is based on in-depth interviews with over 300 policy advocates and systematic information on each of more than 2,000 advocates playing a significant role in a random sample of 98 policy issues in the United States federal government from 1999 to 2002.

AB Despite a good deal of interest in lobbyists' tactics, virtually no research has been published examining the conditions under which interest groups lobby the bureaucracy rather than or in addition to the legislature. Using two comprehensive datasets, I show that lobbying increases in both branches when conflict is higher and when the lobbyist has professional or political connections to that venue. In addition, certain conditions cause lobbyists to specialize in one branch or a particular branch only, depending on the issue area being lobbied, the interest group type being represented, the lobbyist's resources, and other factors.

We first present an overview of lobbying during U.S. regulatory policymaking, including during OIRA's review of proposed government regulations. Second, we introduce readers to a data source that allows scholars to track lobbying during OIRA's regulatory review, and we provide several descriptive statistics from a lobbying dataset that covers January 2005 to June 2011. Third, we highlight different applications of these data, including our efforts to integrate the data with other information sources. We close by encouraging interest groups scholars to take advantage of these largely untapped data, which are more accessible today than even a few years ago and to connect these data with other available sources both inside and outside of the regulatory process.

AB Scholars of policy networks consistently find that agreement on policy explains network ties, but inconsistent results on the importance of strategic considerations, such as the influence of potential partners. We use original data on communications between bureaucrats and lobbyists on pending Medicaid legislation to distinguish network ties (contacts) from bureaucrats' use of those ties to attempt to advance their policy goals (requests for lobbying help). We find that policy agreement explains both the strength of network ties and bureaucrats' requests for advocacy from their partners, but that interest group influence and unified partisan control of government explain only the latter.

ID MINOR PARTIES; LIFE
AB A key question in interest group studies is why some interest groups put forward candidates for election rather than simply trying to influence the political process through normal channels. Theoretically interest groups should not seek public office or compete in elections but should rather pursue their goals through frequent interactions with politicians and bureaucrats. The aim of this article is to examine why such interest groups go beyond the informality stage of simply representing their members' interests by interacting with such politicians and civil servants and instead seek election to public office. As political parties in Ireland now compete on an increasingly narrow issue base, this article argues that interest groups involve themselves in elections precisely because they are better able to influence political decision-making from inside Dail Eireann and that election to the Dail is a sign of their arrival as a serious group with a serious cause. This article categorises these groups into those that run candidates for elected office at both local and national level and those that campaign in specific referendums. It also assesses how such groups in effect move their lobbying activities into parliament as distinct from lobbying outside it as is in the theoretical norm in interest group politics.

AB The paper deals with lobbying, which it defines as a democratic means of promoting interests within society. Using a simple graphic model, it defines the basic ties in lobbying, which, in terms of economic theory, is viewed as a series of ties of a predominantly market nature, where the market concerned is the information market. The role of the Government, which is generally regarded as the central decision-making authority, mainly consists in creating a favourable institutional environment, which does not interfere with spontaneous market relationships However, there are certain situations that the Government could, or should regulate, and this paper discusses such situations using three hypothetical scenarios - a lobbying-free society, a society where lobbying exists, but is not transparent, and a society where lobbing is transparent. The conclusion discusses various regulation options.

AB Most recent work on the politics of interest representation assumes that lobbyists represent their clients' interests with fidelity. We test the validity of this assumption. Relying on a principal-agent framework developed by Stephenson and Jackson, Kersh and Lowery and Marchetti, we first discuss the nature of agency problems in lobbying and the utility of several potential solutions for those problems. We next develop and test two sets of hypotheses on how agency problems might influence one form of lobbying behavior - the prices contract lobby firms charge their interest organization principals. The hypotheses are tested with a purposive sample of clients employing major contract lobby firms operating in Washington DC in 2012.

AB We study how interest group lobbying of the bureaucracy affects policy outcomes and how it changes the legislature's willingness to delegate decision-making authority to the bureaucracy. We extend the standard model of delegation to account for interest group influence during the implementation stage of policy. We analyze how the decision to delegate changes when the bureaucratic agent is subject to external influence. The optimal degree of delegation as well as the extent to which interest groups influence policy outcomes differ depending on whether the system of government is characterized by unified or divided control. The result is a comparative theory of bureaucratic lobbying.

AB This article explores the multilingual and multicultural aspects of community-building, networking and communication in the European Union's (EU) political and administrative system. We investigated the networking and communicative preferences of EU civil servants and lobbyists using survey data and thematic interviews. Our aim was to gain a deeper insight into the ways formal and informal language policies correspond to perceptions and practices of multilingualism among our target group. On a general level, we also explored how decisive the role of multilingualism is in the EU's administration and among lobbyists. We hypothesized that the social and working environment in Brussels, along with the growing use of (Euro)-English contributes to the construction of the cosmopolitan identities of EU civil servants and lobbyists. The findings indicate that although multilingualism appears across the different social contexts under investigation, all of these contexts are heavily dominated by (Euro-) English. Further, in their professional interactions the respondents are highly aware of the relationship of language(s) to power and they prefer the usage of languages that are more power-neutral in their actual setting even if this comes with the cost of mutual unintelligibility. The findings imply that multilingualism plays a less significant role in the social and working lives of Brussels based civil servants and lobbyists than previously assumed (cf. Phillipson, 2003).

AB Intense competition can compel lobbyists to exaggerate the benefits the government would see in tax returns and social welfare if agency officials allocate such resources to the lobbyist's members. This incentive to misrepresent grows when information asymmetry exists between lobbyists and government officials. A large body of literature has investigated how interest groups compete and interact, but it disregards the interdependency of interests between competing groups and associated strategic behaviors of other players. Our signaling model of lobbying reveals ways in which agency officials can compel lobbyists for competing interests to lobby truthfully and what the policy implications of this compulsion can be. We also present case-study evidence of how this works in practice.

AB Interest groups face many choices when lobbying: when, who, and how to lobby. We study interest group lobbying across two stages of regulatory policymaking: the congressional and agency rulemaking stages. We investigate how the Securities and Exchange Commission responds to interest groups at the end of these stages using a new, comprehensive lobbying dataset on the Dodd-Frank Act. Our approach examines citations in the SEC's final rules which reference and acknowledge the lobbying activities of specific interest groups. We find that more than 2,900 organizations engaged in different types of lobbying activities either during the congressional bill stage, the agency rulemaking stage, or both. Meetings with the SEC and hiring former SEC employees are strongly associated with the citation of an organization in a final rule. Comments submitted by trade associations and members of Congress are cited more in a final rule compared to other organizations. While there is more variety in the types of organizations who lobby the bureaucracy than those who lobby Congress, presence does not necessarily lead to recognition or influence.

AB When are strategic appointments useful in curbing policy bias from ex-post negotiation between state agencies and special interest groups? Bertelli and Feldmann (J Public Adm Res Theory 17: 19-38, 2007) provide an insightful analysis of the issue within a full information model of presidential appointments. This paper examines whether and how their findings extend to a world of policy uncertainty and asymmetric information, which rationalizes delegation in the first place. We establish that the occurrence of policy-relevant equilibrium lobbying crucially relies on interest groups' leverage over the appointment game between higher-level institutions. Remarkably, bureaucratic lobbying may prove highly non-neutral with separated powers even when a candidate agency is agreed upon. In some circumstances (e.g., recess appointments in the US), by contrast, strategic appointments fully offset interest group influence in either form of government (unified versus divided), a finding in line with the conventional theory of delegation.

ID ECONOMIC-POLICY; STATE
AB This paper examines the nature of state-business relations and how interest groups utilise the budget process to lobby for tax and expenditure policies in Zambia, using information compiled from budget proposals interest groups submit towards the budget and lobbying activity data published in the daily newspapers between 2006 and 2008. The data shows a significant increase in interest groups formed especially in the civil society segmented and improvements in state-business relations, although not formalised and institutionalised, since political liberalisation in 1991. Analysis of lobbying data indicates that interest groups utilise the formal budget processes and informal policy networks such as the media to lobby unilaterally and collectively for favourable tax and expenditure policies. Tax proposals submitted through government departments had a greater chance of being adopted in the budget as bureaucrats assisted to shepherd them through the budget process.

Scholars investigating lobbying in the EU have made great strides and are now fully integrated into an international community of scholarship, more so than in previous decades. Being clear about the wide range of actors, including government officials, who may play the role of advocates, understanding the complexities of the various venues of policy-making within the EU, and studying framing processes systematically are important challenges as the literature continues to move forward.

AB Much of the lobbying process is inherently competitive: when lobbyists with opposing goals attempt to move outcomes in their preferred direction, successful lobbying by one actor will disadvantage opposing actors. This article theorizes and quantifies the indirect form of influence that competing lobbying actors exert on each other. While existing theories of competitive lobbying have focused on legislation, we argue that all stages of the lobbying process involve competition. Our findings make two contributions to the study of lobbying influence. First, using spatial econometrics, we present the first estimates of how the success of one lobbying actor is shaped by the lobbying activities of opposing actors. Second, we study competition in three diverse empirical settings that capture three different stages of the lobbying process: (1) lobbying camps favoring opposite legislative outcomes in five European countries, (2) US lobbying firms competing over client resources, and (3) corporations competing for administrative trade barriers in 19 World Trade Organization member countries. The results reveal important insights about how interdependence among lobbyists conditions their effectiveness. Our application of spatial techniques to model interdependence between actors is useful for all scholars who want to take competitive or collaborative diffusion mechanisms into account in studies of lobbying and public policy.

DE British parliament; lobbying; lobbyist; newspapers; parliamentary
   debates; United Kingdom (UK); 1800-1950
AB Lobbying is a significant component of the modern politics industry in Britain, but we know relatively little about its historical origins and evolution. This article draws on parliamentary debates and three databases which together account for 51 newspaper titles, in order to explore how lobbying was discussed in parliament and the media between 1800 and 1950, and to gauge the growing professionalisation of lobbying. Perceptions of lobbying became somewhat less negative over the period; there are relatively few reports or allegations of corruption associated with lobbying; and lobbying by the railway industry seems to have been less substantial, while public sector lobbying was more significant, than is commonly supposed. Direct advocacy with policymakers is overwhelmingly the dominant tactic used by lobbyists of the period, with few reports of coalitions or grass-roots campaigns. Particular concerns were expressed about the influence of lobbying around private bills. While lobbying back-bench MPs and parliamentary committees (rather than ministers and civil servants) accounted for over 80% of the activity revealed across the whole period, there are signs by the middle of the 20th century that the focus of lobbyists is beginning to turn away from Westminster and towards Whitehall. The article paints a detailed view of the scale, scope, and significance of lobbying as it was developing into a national and systematic industry.

AB Most lobbying is invisible, meaning that interest groups routinely contact government officials off the public record. While such lobbying is ubiquitous, whether and how it may affect public policy decision-making remains largely unknown. I theorize that lobbying that employs both invisible and visible tactics is the most influential. I study the development of 38 health-related regulatory policies in Wisconsin to assess this argument. I employ government records, survey data from more than 350 individuals, and interviews with 15 state policymakers. I find that invisible and visible lobbyingwhen performed in combinationare associated with greater regulatory policy change. From a normative perspective, these results are both reassuring and troubling. On one hand, the results suggest that invisible lobbying, on its own, rarely drives state regulatory policy shifts. Yet, on the other hand, those interested parties with the resources necessary to lobby across multiple modes are more likely to see policy change.

AB Continuity and advocacy are widely held to be important elements in maternal healthcare, yet they are often lacking from the care women receive. In order to understand this disparity, we draw upon interviews and ethnographic observational findings from The One-to-One Caseload Project, a study exploring the impacts of a caseload model of maternity care within an urban National Health Service provider in Britain. Drawing on Lipsky's (1980) and Prottas's (1979) theories of street-level bureaucracy, this paper attempts to understand how midwives, working on the frontline within caseload and standard care models, manage the competing demands of delivering a personalised service within a bureaucratic organisation. The caseload care model serves as a case study for how a client-centred model of working can assist street-level bureaucrats to manage the administrative pressures of public service organisations and provide their clients with a personalised, responsive service. Nevertheless, despite such benefits, client-centred models of working may have unintended consequences for both health carers and healthcare systems. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article reviews lobbying in the political sciences and public relations literature, and it also provides a conceptualization for the regulatory practices of lobbying around the world. Then, it presents the newest law on lobbying instituted in 2010 in the Republic of Slovenia, the Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act. This Act treats lobbying in two ways: (1) as a communication technique used by interest groups to privately influence government officials and (2) as a process of access to information by the same interest groups. This inconsistency follows the same trend for lobbying regulation in Europe and raises important questions regarding lobbying practice and regulation. Lobbying is fundamentally a public relations practice exercised in private and public sectors, and it uses direct and indirect communication between interest groups and their respective government.

AB Many studies have identified a line of influence between interest group lobbying and the federal bureaucracy's implementation of public policy. These works, however, have often focused on the influence of individual groups rather than coalitional efforts, which compose the majority of lobbying. Assessing this activity is critical to understanding the role of public participants in administrative policymaking. I test the influence of diverse coalitions of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs by analyzing a new dataset of organizations' co-signed public comments across nearly 350 federal agency rules proposed between 2005 and 2015. I find that agencies favor recommendations from organizationally diverse coalitions, and not coalitions that are bipartisan or dominated by business interests. Further, I find that coalition influence is heightened when lobbying in coalitions that are larger in size and more well-resourced, and when policy salience is low. I conclude that diverse lobbying coalitions help bureaucrats to shape the direction and content of regulatory law. This conclusion further establishes the role of organizational participants in bureaucratic policymaking and contributes to the debate over democratic legitimacy in the administrative state.

AB While there may be several practical concerns regarding the practice of corporate lobbying of government officials, there is the more basic question of a corporation's moral right to do so. I argue that group agents such as corporations have no moral rights, and thereby cannot have the right to lobby. There may be a basis for some legal rights for corporations, but I argue that lobbying cannot be one of the legal rights, even by reference to the rights of the individuals that make up the corporation. I end the paper by a discussion of how this argument applies to all private organizations, including public interest organizations.

CT European Public Choice Meeting
CY 2005
CL Durham, ENGLAND
DE bureaucracy; European Union; lobbyism; public goods
AB We develop a model of bureaucratic budget catching, where bureaucracies compete for resources just like fishermen. Considering taxpayers' money a free access resource in the absence of tight fiscal control ( passive sponsors), bureaucratic self-interest may induce excessive lobbying behaviour even from the perspective of the bureaucrats themselves. Our contribution is to extend the original Niskanen (1971) model by suggesting that bureaucrats will expend resources on lobbying rather than provide public goods, thus rendering the bureaus more inefficient. Such decreases in public good provision affect production in society negatively in the next period, leaving fewer resources for the total group of bureaucrats. One possible empirical implication could be bureaucratic lobbying within the EU due to the institutional stronghold of the Commission. Arguably, the weak institutional position of the European Parliament probably contributed to the observable priority of public goods provision. However, rigorous empirical investigations are needed in future to verify or reject our theoretical claims.

AB We provide the first comprehensive study of lobbying across venues by studying interest group registrations in both the legislative and administrative branches. We present four major findings based on Federal and state data. Firstly, groups engage in substantial administrative lobbying relative to legislative lobbying. Secondly, the vast majority of groups lobby the legislature, but a large proportion of groups also lobby the bureaucracy. Thirdly, representational biases in legislative lobbying are replicated across venues: business groups dominate administrative lobbying at least as much as they do legislative lobbying. Finally, the level of interest group activity in one venue for a given policy area is strongly related to its level in the other venue. The findings potentially have important implications for the impact of institutional design on both the form and promotion of broad participation in policy-making as well as the ultimate content of policies chosen by democratic governments, broadly construed.

AB Recent research suggests that there are two different types of lobbyists: those specializing in providing access to their personal connections with public office holders, and those specializing in a particular policy sector. This article advances this research by examining the actual behaviour of consultant lobbyists with data gathered from the Canadian Lobbyist Registry. Specifically, we probe two questions. First, using four indicators found within the literature, we investigate whether the behaviour of consultant lobbyists reflects the well-connected generalist or the issue specialist lobbyist. Second, we examine moving public office holders to see whether administrative officials - who make greater use of technical information - or politicians and partisan advisors - who are more interested in partisan/political information - are more likely to continue to be contacted by consultant lobbyists who contacted them in their previous position. Our results suggest that a more nuanced understanding of lobbying is required. While the majority of activities by consultant lobbyists are consistent with providing expertise to policymakers, a sizable minority of lobbyist activity is consistent with selling access to public office holders. Yet even here, our second analysis suggests that personal relationships may also involve the provision of expertise.

AB Does political uncertainty affect whether lobbyists contact government officials? We suggest that the answer depends on the type of uncertainty introduced. Distinguishing between policy objective uncertainty-where organized interests and lobbyists are uncertain about the policy intentions of decision makers-and issue information uncertainty-where policymakers are uncertain about the technical details of issues-we hypothesize that whereas an increase in policy objective uncertainty leads to a decrease in lobbying, a rise in issue information uncertainty leads to more lobbying. We test the hypotheses with longitudinal data from the Canadian Lobbyists Registry measuring change in the number of times lobbyists have contacted government ministries each month from 2008 to 2018. The results suggest that lobbying intensity does respond differently to these types of uncertainty. Whereas events introducing issue information uncertainty have a statistically significant positive relationship with lobbying, events introducing policy objective uncertainty do not.

SO ECONOMIC THEORY
LA English

DE Discretion; Lobbying; Contest; Agency theory
AB When interest groups compete to influence legislators, the resulting legislation is often vague, and thus obliges the groups to continue their fight in the executive. On its face, this seems inefficient-at least from the point of view of the groups. We explore this intuition in a model of "nested lobbying" in which interest groups first compete to influence a legislative agenda setter, then compete to influence legislative votes over the resulting agenda. If the resulting legislation grants discretion to the executive, the final prize is allocated in yet one more contest in the bureaucracy. We find that when the status quo is non-discretionary, competition over the agenda never results in an agenda that includes discretion. Surprisingly, however, a discretionary status quo can stand with probability 1 if the preferences of the bureaucracy, the legislature, and the agenda setter are arranged in an "iron triangle". Specifically, the bureaucracy and agenda setter must be biased in favor of one group, while the legislature is biased in favor of the other.

AB We report the results of a survey of over 300 lobbyists in three states-Colorado, Ohio, and West Virginia. In the first half of this article, we provide a comprehensive portrait of state lobbyists' attempts to affect state government decisions. In the second half, we address the following research question: What factors affect the lobbying behavior of state lobbyists? Our results suggest a number of conclusions about lobbying in the new millennium, including the following: (1) state lobbyists target the governor's office more than most previous studies suggest; (2) state lobbyists aim their grassroots lobbying efforts at the governor and executive agency bureaucrats as well as legislators; (3) state lobbying remains an intensely personal game, as techniques involving face-to-face contact with government officials remain the most effective; and (4) several variables affect a lobbyist's decisions regarding which techniques to use and where to aim his or her efforts, including the receptivity of potential targets and the type of group for which the lobbyist works.

AB This article examines the role of immigrant-serving nonprofit organizations in making city bureaucracies more accommodating of immigrants' needs. Scholarship highlights the importance of bureaucrats' professional norms and agencies' inclusive missions in this process of "immigrant bureaucratic incorporation," but this article shows that these factors are not always sufficient to explain it. Case study material of campaigns to make government multilingual in New York City and San Francisco, two cities with immigrant-friendly orientations, shows that constant pressure from nonprofit organizations on legislative and administrative officials was required to make city agencies and their services accessible to limited English proficient immigrants.

ID POLICY; MODEL
AB What determines whether interest groups choose to contact politicians or bureaucrats? Despite the importance of this question for policymaking, democracy, and some prominent principal-agent understandings of politics, it is relatively unexplored in the literature. We argue that government stability plays a major part in interest groups' decisions. That is, central to interest groups' decisions is their assessment of the likelihood that politicians currently in power will continue to be in the future. We deduce logical, but totally contrasting hypotheses, about how interest groups lobby under such conditions of uncertainty and then test these using a heteroskedastic probit model that we apply to a unique longitudinal survey of interest groups in Japan. We find that when it is unclear if the party controlling the government will maintain power in the future, interest groups are more likely to contact the bureaucracy. When it is believed that the party in power will retain control for a considerable period, interest groups are more inclined to contact politicians. In addition, during times of government uncertainty, interest groups that are supportive of the governing party (or parties) are more likely to contact politicians and those that are less supportive will be more likely to contact bureaucrats.

We discuss established databases such as regulations.gov, which contains comments on draft agency rules, and newer sources of data, such asex-partemeeting logs, which describe the interest groups and individual lobbyists that bureaucrats are meeting face-to-face about proposed policies. One challenge is that much of these data are not machine-readable. We argue that scholars should invest in several projects to make these datasets machine-readable and to link them to each other as well as to other databases.

AB Studies of venue shopping have typically analyzed the case of an individual advocacy group or issue campaign rather than comparing venue strategies across multiple groups. Moreover, this literature focuses on interest groups and advocacy coalitions whose principal mandate is to influence public policy. Using original data, we test theories of venue selection among nonprofit organizations that report engaging in policy processes but the majority of which do not self-identify as an advocacy group. Our analyses explore the where of nonprofit advocacy across three different venue types: branch (executive, legislative), domain (bureaucracy, elected officials), and level of government (local, state, federal). Like interest groups, we find that nonprofits shop among both executive and legislative branches and among elected and bureaucratic domains; however, they tend to specialize in one level of government. Geographic scope and revenue source predicted venue targeting, but most other organizational characteristics including age, capacity, and structure did not.

Initiatives of interest were revisions to Canada's Food Guide, changes to the nutritional quality of the food supply, front-of-pack nutrition labelling and restrictions on food marketing to children. Results The majority of registrants (88%), and corporations and organizations (90%) represented in lobbying registrations had industry ties. Industry-affiliated stakeholders were responsible for 86% of communications with DPOH, interacting more frequently with DPOH of all ranks, compared to non-industry stakeholders. Most organizations and corporations explicitly registered to lobby on the topic of marketing to children (60%), followed by Canada's Food Guide (48%), front-of-pack nutrition labelling (44%), and the nutritional quality of the food supply (23%). The food and beverage industry, particularly the dairy industry, was the most active, accounting for the greatest number of lobbying registrations and communications, followed by the media and communication industry. Conclusions Results suggest a strategic advantage of industry stakeholders in influencing Canadian policymakers. While some safeguards have been put in place, increased transparency would allow for a better understanding of industry discourse and help protect public health interests during the policy development process.

AB Despite many studies investigating how lobbying expenditures enhance performance outcomes, limited attention has been given to understanding the underlying mechanisms driving firm lobbying behaviors-and, particularly, where firms target their lobbying expenditures. We argue lobbying breadth serves as a risk management strategy to both hedge against possible government intrusion and minimize disapproval of firm actions from government officials. As such, we posit firms' strategic risk will positively relate to breadth of lobbying firms' target. Further, if lobbying breadth serves as risk management strategy, then other aspects that affect decisions about the amount of risk protection a firm may need should also affect this relationship. We argue that CEOs' ownership and firms' political uncertainty may exacerbate exposure from firm risk taking to government actions, thus strengthening the insurance relationship. Similarly, we argue available slack, as a form of internal insurance against government actions, will weaken the relationship between strategic risk taking and lobbying breadth. We find support for most of our arguments in a sample of U. S. manufacturing firms. This research extends understanding of lobbying beyond the predominant focus on expenditures and securing beneficial outcomes. Exploring how lobbying breadth serves an important risk management role also offers insights into firm nonmarket strategy.

AB In the US, where registration of lobbyists is mandatory, the pharmaceutical industry and private health-care providers spend huge amounts of money seeking to influence health policies and government decisions. In Brazil, where lobbying lacks transparency, there is virtually no data on drug industry expenditure to persuade legislators and government officials of their viewpoints and to influence decision-making according to commercial interests. Since 1990, however, the Associacao da Industria Farmaceutica de Pesquisa (Interfarma - Pharmaceutical Research Industry Association), Brazilian counterpart of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), main lobbying organization of the US pharmaceutical industry, has played a major role in the advocacy of interests of major drug companies. The main goals of Interfarma lobbying activities are: shortening the average time taken by the Brazilian regulatory agency (ANVISA) to approve marketing authorization for a new drug; making the criteria for incorporation of new drugs into SUS (Brazilian Unified Health System) more flexible and speeding up technology incorporation; changing the Country's ethical clearance system and the ethical requirements for clinical trials to meet the need of the innovative drug industry, and establishing a National Policy for Rare Diseases that allows a prompt incorporation of orphan drugs into SUS. Although lobbying affects community health and well-being, this topic is not in the public health research agenda. The impacts of pharmaceutical lobbying on health policies and health-care costs are of great importance for SUS and deserve to be investigated.

AB What explains the electoral staying power of many Japanese interest. groups in the wake of electoral reform? Electoral explanations provide part of the answer; candidates in elections to both houses of the Diet continue to face incentives many of them unintended to court the organized vote. But missing from such accounts is an explanation of why economically noncompetitive groups provide the bulk of such support. The primary reason for this, I argue, is organization. As a result of their historical linkages to the bureaucracy, many interests developed hierarchical, national organizational structures that enabled them to carry out a variety of vote-gathering functions that the parties had trouble performing themselves. Although electoral reform and long-term demographic trends have weakened the electoral influence of interest groups, these organizational complementarities between groups and the parties continue to matter in Japanese elections including under conditions of two-party competition. To illustrate these points, I trace the evolution of interest group politics from the era of LDP dominance through the rise of two-party competition and the LDP's recent return to power, using postmasters associations and agricultural cooperatives as case studies.

AB This article explores the nature of long-term interactions between bureaucrats and interest groups by examining two behavioral logics associated with stability in public policy making. In addition to the implicit short-term strategic choices that usually feature in resource-exchange explanations of interest group access to policy makers, this article shows that bureaucracy-interest group interactions are likely to be dictated by routine behavior and anticipating future consequences as well. By drawing on survey and face-to-face interview data of Dutch senior civil servants and interest groups, the analyses reveal that a practice of regular consultations, the need for political support, and a perceived influential position together explain why bureaucrats maintain interactions with interest groups. The combination of these behavioral logics adds important explanatory leverage to existing resource-exchange explanations and shows that organizational processes as well as long-term strategic considerations should be taken into account to fully explain bureaucracy-interest group interactions.

AB Scholarly interest in the ways in which nonprofit organizations (NPOs) engage in the policy process has increased markedly in recent years, but one arena of participation about which we still know very little is administrative lobbying. To date, no study has investigated the factors that influence the strategic decision by an NPO to focus their advocacy resources on the bureaucracy. This essay models the decision to engage in administrative advocacy by 501(c)(3) organizations as a function of the state-level political environment in which they deliver services and the organizational resources that they possess. Data on advocacy activities and organizational characteristics of family planning NPOs are drawn from tax records and data compiled by the National Center for Charitable Statistics.

AB While the Nordic countries have a tradition of integrating privileged interest groups into policy making, a number of studies have argued that this Nordic 'routine corporatism' has changed over the last decades. Studies of Denmark, Norway and Sweden demonstrate that interest groups are less frequently involved in committees preparing policy, that lobbying of parliament has become more important and that the position of citizen groups has strengthened. However, systematic studies of present-day Finland are largely missing. This article therefore adds to the literature by focusing on the Finnish case. Drawing on surveys of interest groups and civil servants, the involvement of interest groups in policy making in Finland is assessed and compared with Denmark and the United Kingdom. It is found that: (1) working groups and similar bodies are still very important sites of advocacy; (2) public administration is a more important site of advocacy than parliament or government; (3) economic groups continue to enjoy a particularly privileged position; and (4) resources predict groups' access to policy making more strongly in Finland than in Denmark or the United Kingdom. These findings imply that routine corporatism persists in Finland to a greater extent than in Denmark. The study augments the existing evidence that corporatism may have adapted to new circumstances rather than being eliminated.

AB In the lobbying literature, the effects of competition-two or more interests lobbying on opposing sides of a policy debate-have not been assessed with regard to government agency policymaking. Consequently, neither the amount nor the effect of competitive lobbying is well understood. Using nearly 1,700 comments on 40 federal agency rules, we evaluate two questions: Do government agencies respond to lobbying by changing agency policies? and Does lobbying on one side of a policy issue beget lobbying on the opposing side? We demonstrate that agencies change the content of final rules in favor of the side that dominates the submission of comments. Thus, it seems the "squeaky wheel gets the grease" during rulemaking. We find no evidence, however, of counteractive lobbying during agency rulemaking. Our results suggest that interest groups may further their policy goals by observing more closely the actions of opposing groups during agency policymaking.

AB Transparency and lobbying, two terms that have direct influences on the behavior of policymakers, politicians, and bureaucrats. Models of both transparency and lobbying exist for decades and are being researched by not only academics but non-profit international organizations and institutions that provide governments with policy recommendations. The recommendations are, however, often based on research that is complicated or almost impossible to perform or relies on self-report surveys by the public officials and policy makers. The real behavior of those actors might, therefore, be hidden. Therefore, there opens an opportunity to model these situations and bring transparency and lobbying into the laboratory or field controlled environment and investigate the behavior of involved actors using methods of experimental economics. As the experimental economics is a field of economic research that has been emerging in the main flow for las few decades, the research on transparency and lobbying is, therefore, emerging as well. There have been published studies that focused on transparency and studies that investigated lobbying, however, the number of publications on experimental research on transparent lobbying is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of experimental research on lobbying and transparency, evaluate the findings and provide suggestions for future research.

AB We propose that Congress controls the flow and content of information to the bureaucracy by creating federal advisory committees with membership rights for general categories of interests. We use data on the appointment of members to the National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC), an advisory committee within the Environmental Protection Agency, to test whether the active interests in the legislative debate over drinking water are represented on the advisory committee, and thus in the EPA's policymaking process, Although agency officials are responsible for appointing the members of NDWAC, we find that public endorsements by interest groups are influential in the agency's selection process. These groups provide reliable information to Congress about applicants' true policy preferences.

AB The settlers constitute a minority group whose goals are becoming increasingly unpopular among Israelis. As a result, the degree of legitimacy granted to them by the government gradually eroded over the years. However, their project still thrives. Their impressive success can be attributed to their focus on the bureaucracy. As early as the 1960s, the settlers engaged in a constant effort to identify actors in state and semi-state agencies that had common interests with them. At first they mobilized supporters from within those agencies. Later they made any effort to fill available positions with their own people. Today, the settlers' movement in Israel has fused itself with the relevant elements within the bureaucracy to a degree that many state agencies serve as extensions of the settler movement.

AB Most states lack the ability to maintain a uniform presence at the local level. While in some places, cit-izens experience an attentive and present state that is quick to address their demands, in other parts, the same state can be unresponsive and absent. The unevenness in state presence shapes its capacity to deliv-ery services and its legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens. What explains the spatial unevenness in local state presence? This paper argues that the transfer preferences of mid-level bureaucrats are an important determinant of local state presence. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines insights from qual-itative fieldwork and a unique dataset on the transfers history of mid-level bureaucrats in Indian land bureaucracy, I show that bureaucrats have strong transfer preferences and regularly lobby to avoid being placed in jurisdictions further away from their homes or being relocated over long distances. Jurisdictions less preferred by bureaucrats are more likely to experience state absence at the local level. Further, spatial disparities in local state absence are concentrated according to historical patterns of development across different regions of the state; historically less developed regions with lower bureaucratic representation within the state and experience a more prolonged duration of bureaucratic absence on account of bureau-cratic lobbying against transfer directives. This paper highlights the importance of transfer preferences of individual bureaucrats and their collective representation in shaping the quality of local governance.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Often it is argued that the EU depoliticizes political issues as bureaucrats and nonmajoritarian institutions are key in the policy-making process. However, recent research rejects this perspective and shows that domestic political cleavages organize the European political space. This article demonstrates that (a) political cleavages affect the organization of policy networks among Euro-level bureaucrats, politicians, and societal interests; and (b) that the institutional organization of government facilitates the emergence of advocacy coalitions mobilizing these political cleavages. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the European political space is dominated by a cleavage between a progrowth coalition and a sustainability coalition. Furthermore, it shows that political officials occupy a pivotal position enabling them to mediate between these two coalitions. Finally, data on the actors' resource reputations suggest that in granting access, public officials attach considerable value to the public support coalitions enjoy.

The antagonistic lobbying constitutes a contest among the bureaucrats. This paper characterizes the Nash equilibria in lobbying and shows in which way exogenously fixed bureaucratic incomes induce the same or different lobbying behavior as incentive incomes.

AB Objective Corporations spend significant resources lobbying for billions of dollars in federal procurement contracts, yet this important opportunity to assess the political influence of business has gone unstudied by scholars of business politics. We study it here. Methods We approach it by analyzing the influence of direct lobbying of five federal departments, along with data on the lobbying of, and campaign contributions to, members of Congress on patterns of contract awards broken out by congressional districts. Results Our analysis reveals that while there are many reasons to expect lobbying Congress to produce valuable contracts, we instead find that it is the direct lobbying of executive branch agencies that is most likely to bring big rewards. Conclusion These results highlight the importance of studying corporate political power outside of the legislative branch, suggesting that it is the long-term relationships that lobbyists build with bureaucrats that yield the most lucrative contracts.

AB This study is aimed to investigate the regional pressure groups' effect on the government size in Turkey. According to the public choice theory, elections, political parties, interest and pressure groups, and bureaucracy significantly affect the public production process. Among these actors, pressure and interest groups directly affect variables such as economic growth and public expenditures. In this study, panel data analysis was used to observe the regional effect. The research data set covered 81 provinces of Turkey and the period between 2006 and 2018. According to the results, it was found that interest and pressure groups increase the public expenditures in the less developed regions in Turkey. These results are consistent with the empirical and theoretical studies. For this reason, the study has an important contribution to the literature. This study offers significant conclusions that public economic policies might be under the influence of interest and pressure groups. Even if stated that the results of this study might have many economic, demographic, social, and political reasons regarding Turkey, in the context of public choice theory, it could be seen as a significant indicator of not using public expenditure policies as efficient instruments. This situation shows that public resources are not used efficiently in Turkey and the government has a negative effect on the economy. To eradicate this negative effect, governments coming to power in the future ought to produce economic, political, and social policies in order to decrease the regional differences dramatically in Turkey.

ID DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT; CITIES; GOVERNANCE
AB There is a sharp contrast between the public value discourse that typifies smart city-making on the one hand and its democratic deficit on the other. In this article we explore this contrast in more detail and assess that the paradigm and practices of networked government, which dominates smart city making, positions citizens as "audiences" of smart city makers and civil servants as "shepherds" of their public values. In these positions, both citizens and civil servants participate in a wide array of smart city experiments and engagements. However, an active, autonomous agenda setting role by citizens or democratically legitimated advocacy of civil servants is rare and does not easily fit within the paradigm of networked government. We draw on the work of Dewey and Marres to envision such different roles and make them concrete by highlighting experiences of Dutch citizens and civil servants with urban data and technology. These show, first, that the desires and goals of citizens may differ markedly from those of the smart city, and-second-that civil servants struggle with legitimate ways to advocate for socially and economically balanced smart city solutions. We conclude, in the final section, that the smart city can only be developed further through representative democratic means of engagement, among which local elections that express the collective desires of citizens and frame the mandate of civil servants.

AB How does the informational role of interest groups interact with institutions when politicians seek to control the bureaucracy? In 1992, Banks and Weingast argued that bureaucrats hold an informational advantage vis-a-vis political principals concerning policy-relevant variables, and that when it is prohibitively costly to audit, the agency may over- or understate the extent of a public problem. This is less likely to happen if there is a low-cost monitoring technology and if interest groups can monitor the agency's choices. I test this hypothesis using data on bureaucratic statements that estimate the importance of a number of hazardous waste problems from a group of state-level environmental agencies. The results provide evidence for the Banks-Weingast hypothesis.

AB Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play an important role in the representation of citizens' interests towards policymakers. However, they increasingly run their campaigns not only against policymakers, but also against corporations. While the choice among strategies has been examined either in the state (targeting policymakers) or in the market (targeting companies), the choice between the two remains unexamined. Moreover, conventional studies of advocacy have failed to comparatively assess how groups combine strategies. This study fills these gaps, examining when NGOs target their campaigns at (a) the market, (b) the state and (c) both. It examines 24 NGO campaigns in the UK and Italy using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Three main findings emerge. First, structural factors - especially the openness of the market - are most important in determining which target an NGO chooses. Second, campaigns that combine strategies tend to be either market- or state-oriented. Finally, high resources are the factor that pushes NGOs to combine strategies across the market and the state.

AB Indigenous populations worldwide endure disparities in access to biomedical health care. This article suggests that institutional bureaucracy is an important and underexamined barrier to health care for indigenous Maya people in Guatemala. Based on interviews, participant observation, and seven years of experience with a non-governmental organization's patient advocacy program, we examine how biomedical institutions' administrative systems impede indigenous patients' abilities to obtain specialty medical treatments. Particularly, we examine the roles that street-level bureaucrats such as security guards and nurses play in restricting access to health care as well as how bureaucratic adherence to procedure can override clinical concerns in ways that actively harm patient health. We also highlight how indigenous Maya patients with limited Spanish language abilities and low literacy tend not to have the cultural capital to successfully navigate hospital environments. As such, bureaucracy in biomedical institutions replicates colonial and postcolonial social inequalities in ways that restrict access to care. Patient navigation is a valuable and urgently-needed service for Maya patients and a gap that could be filled by the numerous health service organizations operating in Guatemala.

AB Can professional low-level bureaucrats who implement policy act as policy entrepreneurs and affect policy design? Does the transition from traditional, hierarchical administrations to local governance systems play a role in enabling policy entrepreneurship among such low-level bureaucrats? We explore these questions using the case study of waste separation in Israeli local authorities. We maintain that the attributes of local governance can explain their success in affecting policy. Our findings demonstrate how low-level bureaucrats who act as policy entrepreneurs use the structural characteristics of governance as a window of opportunity for reform. When the mode of governance is more lateral and less traditional, these bureaucrats have a better chance of acting as policy entrepreneurs.

AB The Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) posits that policy actors, including elected officials and bureaucrats, aggregate into coalitions based on shared beliefs and coordinate to achieve policy objectives. Yet, bureaucrats are often subject to political control mechanisms understood within a principal-agent framework. Combining insights from principal-agent theory and the ACF, we explore the nature of principal-agent relationships within and across advocacy coalitions in the United States using case studies of nuclear waste management and fair housing policy. Specifically, we develop three propositions regarding principals and agents as members of advocacy coalitions and examine those propositions by comparing the two case studies. We find that powerful elected officials and expert bureaucrats are important resources for coalitions; bureaucrats are in coalitions but face cross-pressure from principals in opposing coalitions; and control mechanisms embedded in policy designs by principals can limit bureaucratic discretion in a way that aligns with coalition goals.

AB This paper studies the impact of lobbying on policies in a centrally managed water economy. First, we develop an optimal control model in which long-run water-management policies are an outcome of negotiation between policymakers and a politically organized farming sector. We show that under equilibrium conditions in the political game, larger political power of the farmers' lobby leads to faster exhaustion of naturally replenished water resources, and expedites the investment in water-supply backstop technologies such as desalination. Then, we employ a detailed hydro-economic model of Israel's water economy to assess the validity of claims by scientists and bureaucrats that lobbying by the local agricultural sector has contributed to the depletion of the country's natural freshwater resources and thus accelerated the development of seawater desalination. Specifically, we compare observed trajectories of water-management policies in the years 2000-2020 to their simulated counterparts, and find a better fit for simulated scenarios that involve lobbying than for a socially optimal one; this result prevails under simulated conditions of extreme water shortage due to faster population growth or lower recharge of natural water sources. The best-fitted political-equilibrium scenarios indicate considerable deadweight loss. We discuss potential causes of over-and undervaluation of the lobbying effect.

AB This paper looks at tariff boards from their creation in 1816 to their disappearance in 1845. By studying their regulation and composition, a new perspective is gained on how tariffs were elaborated and set, and the roles played by ideas and interest groups on the boards. The analysis of their members illustrates the complex transition from the Old Regime to early liberalism. Boards of tariffs, with a very stable memberships, were important factors in the continuity of tariff policy in the tariffs of 1820, 1825 and 1841.

AB North Korea is often characterized as some form of highly centralized rule: totalitarian, posttotalitarian, corporatist, or personalistic. This article argues that much of the confusion around understanding North Korea's actions stems from misplaced models. Much of the current thinking on North Korea's politics does not account for the limited institutional plurality in the system. The article documents how the state's political institutions have changed since the country's founding and highlights the formal and informal roles of each major bureaucracy today. The Korean Workers Party and the role of Juche have declined, but the National Defense Commission and "military-first politics" have not taken their place as reigning supreme. Rather the interaction between the Korean Workers Party, military, and cabinet helps explain and moderate policy outcomes.

TI Advocacy for mental health: roles for consumer and family organizations

ID EXPERIENCE
AB The World Health Organization urges countries to become more active in advocacy efforts to put mental health on governments' agendas. Health policy makers, planners and managers, advocacy groups, consumer and family organizations, through their different roles and actions, can move the mental health agenda forward. This paper outlines the importance of the advocacy movement, describes some of the roles and functions of the different groups and identifies some specific actions that can be adopted by Ministries of Health. The mental health advocacy movement has developed over the last 30 years as a means of combating stigma and prejudice against people with mental disorders and improving services. Consumer and family organizations and related NGOs have been able to influence governments on mental health policies and laws and educating the public on social integration of people with mental disorders. Governments can promote the development of a strong mental health advocacy sector without compromising this sector's independence. For instance, they can publish and distribute a directory of mental health advocacy groups, include them in their mental health activities and help fledgling groups become more established. There are also some advocacy functions that government officials can, and indeed, should perform themselves. Officials in the ministry of health can persuade officials in other branches of government to make mental health more of a priority, support advocacy activities with both general health workers and mental health workers and carry out public information campaigns about mental disorders and how to maintain good mental health. In conclusion, the World Health Organization believes mental health advocacy is one of the pillars to improve mental health care and the human rights of people with mental disorders. It is hoped that the recommendations in this article will help government officials and activists to strengthen national advocacy movements.

TI Repairing the State: Policy Repair in the Frontline Bureaucracy
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID STREET-LEVEL BUREAUCRATS; DISCRETION; MOTIVATION
AB Research on street-level bureaucrats has identified their role as policy entrepreneurs through the adoption and advocacy of policy innovations. This article adds to this research by underscoring how street-level bureaucrats use creativity and improvisation to find contextual solutions for emergent local policy problems in response to scarcity. We suggest that these practices of policy repair allow frontline bureaucracies to deal with personnel, process, and material scarcity and maintain public service delivery even in resource-scarce environments. Using ethnographic data from Punjab, Pakistan, we show that this repair work is collaborative, client-centered, and motivated by compassion and kindness. Our research indicates that emergent and improvised policy repair allows frontline bureaucracies to be resilient and responsive to scarcity and changing service demands. Our findings further suggest that inclusion of street-level bureaucrats in formal policy decisions can help develop context-specific solutions to emergent problems of public service delivery. Practitioner Points Street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) face multiple types of scarcity during policy implementation-material scarcity, where they do not have enough equipment or space for their work; process scarcity, where officially sanctioned menu of routines or procedures do not account for local situations; and personnel scarcity, where they do not have enough workforce or expertise for their tasks. SLBs do policy repair-use creativity and innovation in their day-to-day work to find local and contextualized solutions for their localized service limitations, to overcome scarcity, and to deal with the vulnerability of bureaucratic systems. Allowing SLBs to use creativity and improvisation for local and emergent problems can create more robust and resilient public service delivery systems. Repair requires implicit and local knowledge of bureaucratic systems; inclusion of SLBs in formal policy decisions is necessary to develop context-specific solutions to emergent problems of public service delivery.

AB This article sets out to identify a culture of advocacy that has come to characterise Swedish civil society, formed around a long-standing tradition of close and cordial relations between civil society organisations, popular movements, and state and government officials. We argue that Swedish civil society organisations (CSOs) have been allowed to voice critique against public actors and policies and are expected to do so. Based on a large survey of Swedish CSOs, this study contributes unique data on what type of advocacy strategies CSOs practise, and the range of advocacy strategies that organisations employ. The analysis also explores norm-breaking behaviour, such as holding back criticism of public authorities. The results reveal a complex picture of a culture of advocacy: we find patterns of intense political activity among organisations that admit they hold back in their criticism of public authorities and the use of a wide range of advocacy strategies. The article contributes to and challenges established advocacy research and analyses established patterns of organisations' advocacy activities with the symbolic acts of breaking norms, as an analytical approach for the study of advocacy strategies in general and advocacy culture in particular.

I test several related propositions from this theory using original survey and demographic data from a sample of anti-violence groups in the 250 largest American cities. The results of my analysis suggest that interest group attempts to influence bureaucratic action on hate crime are constrained by the group characteristics, their sources and use of financial resources, and the characteristics of the communities in which they operate.

AB Purpose - Firms influence a government to their advantage in one of two ways: either through lobbying a government to change the rule, or through bribing bureaucrats to circumvent the rule. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether and under what conditions do corporate political activities facilitate firm growth in a multinational context, especially in developing economies.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on the data of the World Bank's Enterprise Survey, conducted by the World Bank in the 2002 to 2006 period in 12 countries. To deal with a multilevel structure, the authors applied multilevel regression as the main analysis method.
   Findings - The analysis reveals that both political activities are prevalent in emerging markets, but they play very different roles on firm growth. The authors also find that the effect of lobbying is more pronounced in politically durable countries where firms can secure their vested benefits by lobbying.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to the corporate political activities literature by investigating the distinguishing and contingent role of bribery and lobbying on firm performance.

DT Article
DE Regulatory Impact Assessment; interest groups; Mexico; developing
   countries; accountability
AB Over the last decade, many developing countries have adopted the Regulatory Impact Assessment ( RIA). Despite the promise of bringing economic development, the results have been largely disappointing. The conventional wisdom is that the lack of administrative capacity and data availability are the two main reasons behind this failure. However, an in-depth analysis of two recent high-impact RIAs performed by Mexican authorities reveals that regulatory capture might be an additional and significant problem. In both cases, RIAs appear as merely instrumental to confer a scientific aura to the political rhetoric supporting a regulation that favored a specific interest group. In this vein, absent a sufficiently strong system of checks and balances, a greater sophistication of government officials might paradoxically reduce accountability and transparency. In the last section, we briefly sketch a possible reform aimed at preventing this risk, namely the introduction of a supranational non-binding process of appeal against especially relevant RIAs.

AB The South Korean government implemented a law that separates the dispensing and prescribing (SDP) of drugs in July 2000. It was one of the most controversial issues in the Korean healthcare delivery system. Drawing on the conflict-cycle view and stakeholder analysis, which was used to examine how multiple stakeholders influenced this policymaking process, this study examines 1) the role of Korean civil society (i.e., civic and special interest groups) in SDP reform and 2) why SDP reform led to unintended consequences. We argue that bureaucrats in the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoHW) should have played a central role in accommodating the public interest. Because they failed to do so, civic groups assumed major mediating and moderating roles. Due to the civic groups' lack of technical knowledge and professional experience, however, they played a limited role. In finalizing the proposal, therefore, bureaucrats were captured by strong interest groups, leading to unintended consequences, such as the increased use of non-covered services and higher healthcare expenditures. To ensure that the government serves the authentic public interest rather than special interest groups, bureaucrats should be responsible to the public rather than these interest groups. Moreover, civic groups should be strengthened (in relation to strongly organized interest groups) and included systematically in creating health policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PATRONAGE; BUREAUCRACY; INTEGRITY
AB This study investigates the concept of bureaucratic competence. Specifically, we challenge the argument that a "careerists' premium''-the tendency for public services run by careerists to receive better performance evaluations than services administered by other types of public managers-necessarily is explained by the superior expertise of career bureaucrats. Evidence that forms the basis of this possibility comes from performance evaluations of Korean state-owned enterprises (SOEs) managed by different types of executives between 2000 and 2015. The results of our analyses provide support for the existence of a careerists' premium. However, we find that the premium is most salient and significant when executives had retired from the governmental agency that oversees the performance-evaluation process. Moreover, the gap between qualitative and quantitative assessment scores increase significantly when the evaluated SOEs are managed by career executives who have retired from the regulating agency. This result suggests that the oft-cited careerists' premium may not necessarily signify careerists' greater expertise; it may also be the product of lobbying and regulatory capture.

AB Endogenous policy models usually neglect that government policies are frequently the result of decisions taken at different tiers by different agents, each enjoying some degree of autonomy. In this paper, policies are the outcome of the choices made by two agents within a hierarchy. A legislator decides on the budget to be successively spent by a bureaucrat. Both agents are lobbied by one or two interest groups. The combination of sequential decisionmaking and lobbying implies that the interaction between the agent at one tier and,the interest group(s) depends on the exchange between the same interest group(s) and the agent at the other tier. Our results concerning multi-tier lobbying and legislatorial oversight substantially qualify the conventional wisdom related to one-tier lobbying. In particular, the reaction of the legislator to lobbying at the bureaucratic tier may make lobbying wasteful even when there is no competition from other lobbies. Moreover, the legislator benefits from lobbying only when there is competition between interest groups at the upper tier. It is also shown that competition for influence at the bureaucratic tier may work as a perfect substitute for legislatorial oversight. Extensions of the model indicate its usefulness for the analysis of decisionmaking in other multilevel governance structures, like federations or firms. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Former government officials have many different opportunities to cash in on their public service, but most academic research and government ethics regulations focus on lobbying. We argue that this focus understates the extent and diversity of employment opportunities available to former officials. Using a new data set of officeholders in American government (members of Congress, governors, members of the cabinet, executive branch officials, and ambassadors), we show that, with the exception of members of the House, former officials are more likely to join boards of public companies than they are to work as registered lobbyists. Furthermore, former officials join boards more quickly and face fewer ethics regulations compared to lobbyists. Increasing restrictions on lobbying also appears to push former officials toward alternative employment such as board service. Our findings demonstrate the breadth of the labor market for former politicians and suggest fruitful new avenues for research on political careers.

AB Scholars of street-level bureaucracy and institutional research focus primarily on the relationships between advocates and their larger bureaucratic and social systems, assuming that advocates have little need to satisfy their beneficiaries. We find otherwise in our two-year ethnographic study of public defenders advocating for disadvantaged clients in interactions with district attorneys. In our analysis of 82 advocacy opportunities, we demonstrate that, when existing bureaucratic and social systems put beneficiaries at a disadvantage, advocates may be concerned about managing fraught relationships with their beneficiaries in addition to navigating barriers within the bureaucratic and social systems. We further show a tension between the two; ironically, engaging in advocacy work on behalf of beneficiaries can lead to beneficiary mistrust. As a result, advocates engage in triadic advocacy work-managing impressions with their beneficiaries while also influencing powerful actors within the system on behalf of these same beneficiaries. Understanding the process by which advocates navigate this tension is critical to understanding benefi-ciary outcomes. By reconceptualizing advocacy work as a triadic process among advocate, bureaucratic system, and beneficiary rather than as a dyadic process between advocate and bureaucratic system, this paper develops new theory about how advocates can attempt to garner benefits that advance the rights and opportunities of the disadvantaged.

AB One of the remarkable and unique aspects of the recent history of rare disease research has been the evolving role of patient advocacy groups and the collaborative partnership that exists among such groups and the scientists who study rare diseases, as well as the government officials charged with overseeing medical research and regulatory processes. This collaboration, which in many respects developed out of necessity on all sides, is unparalleled in other areas of medical research and product development. It has played a significant role over the past 30 years in the adoption of public policies, available research funding and other factors affecting the general climate for research on rare diseases. Specific areas of interest include the adoption of the Orphan Drug Act in the U.S. in 1983 and subsequent similar legislation elsewhere in the world; the relationship of patient advocacy groups with government research funding and regulatory entities; the role of patient advocacy groups in seeking to "de-risk" orphan product development through initiatives such as facilitating patient registries and disease natural histories; the role of advocacy groups in ensuring that patients have access to treatments; and the increasing globalization of patient advocacy initiatives.

ID ADVOCACY COALITION FRAMEWORK; COORDINATION
AB In spite of their long history and extensive activities, the international committees of the Nordic Council of Ministers (NCM) have not hitherto been subject to scholarly examination. This article analyses for the first time policy learning among civil servants and experts in this international organization. Using the Advocacy Coalition Framework as the starting point, a number of exploratory hypotheses on policy learning in the NCM committees are tested. The aim is to investigate the processes of policy learning between countries in international committees, a subject which has hitherto only been dealt with in very few studies. In this analysis, a methodology for measuring policy learning is also proposed. Among other things, it is concluded that policy learning in these international committees increases when they avoid fragmentation into coalitions, are open to public opinion, when participants in committees are driven by a sense of purpose rather that material interest, when empirical data are made available to committees, when a neutral presidency is present in order to act as an authoritative persuader, and when neutral experts participate, although not experts from consultancy firms.

AB Denmark and Norway have experienced significant political changes during the past three decades, changes that affect the constraints and opportunities organized interests are facing. Corporatist representation in the policy-making process has declined, and changes in executive-legislative relations have increased the power of parliaments. Organized interests are expected to adapt to these changing circumstances to maintain their political influence. This article shows how Danish and Norwegian interest groups have coped with the decline of corporatism and the revival of parliaments. Representation in corporatist policy-making committees and lobbying toward civil servants in government ministries have been supplemented and in some cases substituted by political lobbyism directed toward elected representatives in the parliament and the government. The analysis is based on panel data from several surveys carried out among nationwide interest groups in Denmark and Norway.

   resource-constrained; South Africa; street-level bureaucracy
ID PUBLIC-SECTOR; DISCRETION; FRAMEWORK; HEALTH
AB Introduction: In the perspectives of implementation of policy, the top-down and bottom-up perspectives of policy-making dominate the discourse. However, service delivery and therefore the experience of the policy by the citizen ultimately depend on the civil servant at the front line to implement the policy. Lipsky named this street-level bureaucracy, which has been used to understand professionals working in the public sector throughout the world. The public sector in South Africa has undergone a number of changes in the transition to a democratic state, post 1994. This needs to be understood in public administration developments throughout the world. At the time of the study, the public sector was characterized by considerable inefficiencies and system failures as well as inequitable distribution of resources. The context of the study was a rural hospital serving a population of approximately 150 000.
   Methods: An insider-ethnography over a period of 13 months explored the challenges of being a professional within the public sector in a rural hospital in South Africa. Data collection included participant observation, field notes of events and meetings, and documentation review supplemented with in-depth interviews of doctors working at a rural hospital. Street-level bureaucracy was used as a framework to understand the challenges of being a professional and civil servant in the public sector.
   Results: The context of a resource-constrained setting was seen as a major limitation to delivering a quality service. Yet considerable evidence pointed to doctors (both individually and collectively) being active in managing the services in the context and aiming to achieve optimal health service coverage for the population. In the daily routine of the work, doctors often advocated for patients and went beyond the narrow definitions of the guidelines. They compensated for failing systems, beyond a local interpretation of policy. However, doctors also at times used their discretion negatively, to avoid work or to contribute to the inefficiencies of healthcare delivery.
   Conclusions: While appearing to be in conflict, the merging of the roles of the health professional and the bureaucrat is required to be able to function effectively within the healthcare system. Being a doctor and being a civil servant are synergistic in daily work, and as a result it is difficult to neatly differentiate professional and civil servant roles in decision-making. It is in the discretion of both roles that considerable flexibility within the roles is possible. Such freedom to act is critical for being able to find local solutions and thereby improve healthcare services. The findings resonate strongly with studies from other parts of the world and offer a window into making sense of the local decision making of doctors. Street-level bureaucracy remains an important lens to view the work of healthcare professionals in the public sector. In the tension between the top-down policy-making and the bottom-up pressure, street-level bureaucracy acts as an important terrain for improving the implementation of services and therefore advocacy and health system improvement.

AB The aim of this article introduces the establishment of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the Czech Republic. They belong to interest groups, are interested in generally beneficial issues, are not directly part of the structure of government and act independently of it. The West European countries have begun to recognize the positive role and impact of NGOs over the course of the 90s. The result has been a shift from the concept of "government" to the concept of "governance". The tool for governance is a civic dialogue, which develops participative democracy, i.e. the possibility to express and participate in the decision-making process during the election period. Economists describe the civil sector as the environment responsible for expanding the wealth of a society. Non-governmental non-profit organizations add a new perspective and guide the reactions of both local needs and problems as well as issues of a global character at the turn of the 21st century. A rigid centralized system in the post communist countries has been largely replaced by a bureaucracy lacking both experience and finances to create a truly democratic alternative. The main problems of these countries is a deficit of rules of communication with the interest groups (NGOs included), limited power (capacity) of state institutions and no clear lines between state activities and civil society. although almost 20 years have passed since the fall of the totalitarian state in the Czech Republic, the rebirth of civil society has been and continues to be, a painful and tong-term process. Non-profit organizations have been declared by public administration as partners and colleagues, but in practice this is still not an equal relationship. What is missing here is a clear vision supported by social consensus regarding the role of the state in Czech society, or what function the state should perform.

AB What is the impact of bureaucratic behaviors on tax rates? What is preferable: a bureaucrat or a partisan politician? Does a flypaper effect occur when lobby groups influence public policies? This article tries to answer these questions by analyzing and comparing six different models of public choice: (1) the median voter model, (2) the Leviathan model, (3) the slack-maximizing model, (4) a general model of bureaucracy, (5) the partisan politicians model and (6) a general model of lobbying. Among several results, it is shown that the median voter's income and tax share almost always play a significant role in the design of the public good/tax package, even if the government does not explicitly try to maximize the median voter's utility. The article also provides a synthesis of the positive analysis of the flypaper effect.

AB Asserting presidential preferences in a regulatory review bureaucracy US presidents face many challenges in executing their duties as CEOs of a mammoth sprawling bureaucracy known as the nation's executive branch. Included among the many offices and bureaus in 2014 were 78 regulatory agencies with more than 276,000 employees who in recent years turned out annually some 80,000 Federal Register pages of rules and rule modifications. A successful president, e.g., one who can be reelected or help to pave the way for the party in the next election, must find ways to steer bureau activities in his preferred direction while delivering on regulatory promises made in the process of being elected. White House review of proposed regulations provides an opportunity for presidents to affect regulatory outcomes in ways that reward politically important interest groups. Our review of all empirical work on White House review as well as our own institutional and statistical findings yield strong support to the notion that the review process provides opportunities to make presidential preferences operational.

AB The systemic difficulties of health care in the USA have brought to light another issue in nurse-patient advocacy - those who require care yet have inadequate or non-existent access. Patient advocacy has focused on individual nurses who in turn advocate for individual patients, yet, while supporting individual patients is a worthy goal of patient advocacy, systemic problems cannot be adequately addressed in this way. The difficulties nurses face when advocating for patients is well documented in the nursing literature and I argue that, through collective advocacy, professional nursing associations ought to extend the reach of individual nurses in order to address systemic problems in health care institutions and bureaucracies.

ID ORGANIZATIONS; PROTESTS; STATE; US
AB In Western countries, the grassroots NGO coalition plays a significant role in promoting the public expression of vulnerable communities. Grassroots NGO coalition has gradually become the leading actor of national policy advocacy by resources and scale of community members. However, China's grassroots NGOs coalition face many restrictions regarding organizational resources and political opportunities structure. Firstly, the grassroots NGOs relatively lack professionalism, funding, and other critical organizational resources. Secondly, the grassroots NGOs themselves and their coalition have difficulty obtaining legal status and have no institutional channels for policy expression. This unfavorable situation requires them to innovate 'alternative' strategies for public expression. The article finds that the grassroots NGO coalition of vulnerable communities has built up the political legitimacy of advocacy action by absorbing powerful social and political elites. It has also cooperated with international NGO to make up for the lack of internal and external resources, which also can expand the social impact and public attention on policy advocacy. Then, the grassroots NGO coalition selects the existing institutional channel for individuals as an intermediary to contacting government officials, submitting policy proposals. Meanwhile, the grassroots NGO coalition adopts professional elites to build the professionalism and social legitimacy of proposals. National policy advocacy also expands the political opportunities structure of local advocacy by promoting local citizens and grassroots NGOs to conduct social surveys, providing policy templates, and communicating with daily virtual communities. The changing structure offers the possibility for continuous advocacy action.

SO SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES

ID CORPORATISM; DENMARK
AB Research has shown that interest organizations seeking influence on public decision making pay increasing attention to parliamentary actors. No distinction has, however, been made between attempts to affect law-making directly and attempts to gain influence on other parliamentary activities such as agenda setting and control of bureaucracy. Drawing on data about organizational approaches to the Danish parliament, this article demonstrates that interest organizations influence strategies in relation to different parliamentary activities show dissimilar patterns. Strategies in regard to law-making fluctuate with the strength of parliament vis-a-vis the government, while strategies concerned with more general parliamentary activities depend more on the level of these activities and secondarily on increases in parliamentary resources. The analysis thus confirms that organizations react to changes in the political role of parliament, but takes the understanding of this a step further by emphasizing that changes in direct parliamentary influence on law-making and in more general parliamentary activities affect different aspects of organizations' influence strategies.

TI Civil society and interest groups in contemporary Japan
SO PACIFIC AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB This article probes the extent to which the new literature on civil society should lead to. a revised understanding of Japan's political economy and policymaking processes. We seek to place two literatures-the older work on political economy and the more recent writings on civil society-in perspective.
   The article presents a broad analysis of the influence of civil society groups, drawing evidence from the JIGS survey of interest groups, an extensive random sample survey of more than 1,600 associations in Tokyo and also in Ibaraki Prefecture, involving 36 questions and 260 subquestions.
   The analysis provides a general overview of the involvement of civil society groups in the policymaking process. We focus on three main aspects. First, we distinguish among the types of groups that involve themselves in policy making. These groups are broken down in the JIGS survey by their predominant activity (e.g., agricultural groups or sports groups) and their legal status. Second, we investigate in which areas groups seek to influence policy. This means both the broad issue area (e.g., agriculture) as well as the groups' response to a specific list of policy changes over the past decade. Third, we probe the relationships these groups have with other groups as well as with other political actors (e.g., local governments, political parties). Also, we are concerned with the means by which the groups seek to influence policy making-and we include in this category specific information such as whether the groups offered electoral support or provided postretirement posts to bureaucrats.
   We find that Japanese associational structure is characterized by the pronounced strength of economic or business organizations compared to other groups. This is true when we look at the number of groups, the size or resources of the organizations and the success that economic groups have in gaining access to policy makers. Our evidence reinforces the picture of high levels of communication and interaction between business organizations and the economic bureaucracy, and the relative exclusion of citizens' groups.

AB Objective: Identify the barriers and facilitators of health advocacy to users delivered by nurses from the Family Health Strategy. Method: Qualitative study carried out with nurses from the Family Health Strategy of a city in the south of Brazil. Study participants were 15 nurses, who were interviewed. The content of the interviews was recorded, transcribed and analyzed in the light of the discursive text analysis. Results: Two categories emerged, one about the lack of organization at the workplace, bureaucracy and limitations to professional work in health environments, and another about the facilitating aspects to exercise advocacy both individually and collectively. Conclusion: When nurses, provided with technical, scientific and relational knowledge, are empowered to make decisions, they are not only supported by other professionals at work but also develop actions of health advocacy to users, thus qualifying the care delivered.

AB Invasive nontyphoidal salmonellosis (iNTS) is often not recognized clinically, and prevention of iNTS is largely ignored by policy planners and decision makers. During 2010, an estimated 3.4 million cases and 681 316 deaths occurred worldwide due to iNTS, with the largest estimated disease burden in resource-limited areas of sub-Saharan Africa. These figures likely underestimate global burden for several reasons, further complicating efforts to raise awareness of iNTS. To increase disease recognition and facilitate development of interventions, a communication and advocacy plan should be developed and implemented by actors in different sectors of global health, including researchers and scientists, funders, vaccine manufacturers, civil society organizations, and government officials from highly affected countries.

AB Zero tolerance towards corruption and related disclosure of irregularities is more frequently a subject of discussions than serious attempts to determine its magnitude in state administration. Consequently, a survey was conducted among civil servants on the perception of corruption based on the model of Transparency International. Civil servants, as drafters of legislation and especially as (in)direct participants in the exercise of public power, more frequently detect irregularities, as they are reported by the media, or are perceived through a system-oriented work in this area. In the context of our research, it was found that perception of the general state of corruption in Slovenia is higher than the global average. Slovenian civil servants believe that the government is under the influence of interest groups and that its effectiveness decreases. As the most corrupt, they exposed the political parties, media and the health care system, and the military, NGOs, and police as the least corrupt.

AB Background Community-based distribution (CBD) of injectable contraceptives has increased access to family planning for millions of women in rural areas in resource-limited settings. Despite the evidence of the success of this contraceptive delivery method, many nations have yet to integrate CBD into their family planning policies. The aim of this paper to describe the process through which PATH spearheaded efforts to successfully advocate for policy change to authorize non-clinical personnel in Zambia to provide injectable contraceptives.
   Methods We describe a four-part framework for policy advocacy: (a) evidence building and technical assistance, (b) stakeholder engagement, (c) government engagement, and (d) knowledge dissemination.
   Results Advocacy for policy change to allow CBD of injectable contraceptives was long and iterative. Evidence to support advocacy efforts was built through a Zambian delegates' study tour to Rwanda to witness Rwanda's robust CBD program and a rapid assessment of Zambian pilot sites where non-clinical personnel were administering injectable contraceptives. Advocacy was led by PATH in partnership with key stakeholders from the Zambia Family Planning Technical Working Group (FPWTG), key government officials, and a special task force of stakeholders focused on advocating for CBD of injectable contraceptives. This task force used evidence from the study tour and rapid site assessment in national and international forums to demonstrate the beneficial effects of allowing non-clinical personnel to administer injectable contraceptives. The Zambian government authorized the policy change in 2016.
   Conclusion The policy advocacy efforts of PATH. FPWTG, and the special task force demonstrate the need for an ample evidence base and sustained engagement of government and stakeholder groups.

AB The struggle of the Indonesian women's movement to advocate for pro-women legislation during the period 1998 to 2017 has had significant achievements and lessons to demonstrate. This paper reports on how women's groups organized themselves for policy advocacy under the Jaringan Kerja Prolegnas Pro Perempuan or JKP3 (the Network for Pro-Women National Legislation Programme) in the Reformation Era. This is based on literature review, observation and participation in various activities conducted by the network and an analysis of field notes and documents. The network faces significant obstacles and challenges from external parties, namely the government, legislators in parliament, and the general public. The obstacles and challenges faced include lack of concern and understanding about gender equality, rejection of pro-women perspectives, certain religious teachings which limit women's rights or roles, lack of concern on the part of the bureaucracy and the political attitudes of legislators. Meanwhile, the network also faces various significant challenges of the internal dynamics among different groups. These lead us to identify significant lessons about approaches and strategies. The paper ends with discussion and recommendations for further advocacy work and research on pro-women policy advocacy.

AB In 2005, after many years of inaction, the Canadian government seemed poised to make real changes to national childcare policy-a marker of social movement success for the grassroots Childcare Advocacy Association of Canada (CCAAC). In this paper, we analyse childcare policy developments in Canada between 2003 and 2005, drawing on qualitative interviews conducted with CCAAC staff and members, allies from other national childcare organizations, and former elected government officials and policy makers. Given its role as a grassroots social movement organization and not a professional association (which can be more closely aligned with governments), we hypothesized that the CCAAC would take a conflictual approach to the federal government's policy initiative. Our close analysis of interviews with CCAAC staff, their allies and elected government officials and civil servants instead reveals conflictual and cooperative relations (Giugni and Passy, In: From contention to democracy. Lanham, MD, Rowman & Littlefield. 1998) during this important period. Our discussion explores some possible conditions in the sociopolitical environment and the internal structure of CCAAC that account for this conflictual-cooperation SMO-government relationship from 2003 to 2005.

AB Background: Recent studies show that Iranians, especially women, do not have enough physical activity and if serious measures are not taken to resolve this problem, the consequences will be harmful to the society. The purpose of this advocacy paper was to determine and explain the responsibilities of all organizations and institutions responsible for promoting physical activity to root out the problem. Methods: After a thorough library search we conducted nine in-depth interviews with the relevant policymakers and government officials, managers, and practitioners in promoting physical activity. All interviews were recorded. To analyze, all of voice files were typed, saved as Word files, and exported to MAXQDA10 software by the research team. To find the main themes, all the files were read carefully several times. Then they were coded, categorized, and organized based on the main objectives of the study. In this way, themes and subthemes were emerged. Results: According to the participants in the study current state of physical activity in the country, especially among women, is not promising. The participants explained about the main obstacles for promotion of physical activity in the country and recommended practical strategies for its promotion. The strategies were suggested in three areas: Promoting culture, social protection, and adjusting current policies to overcome the existing barriers. Conclusion: Regarding the unfavorable state of physical activity in the country presentation of this advocacy document can be an effective step in promoting physical activity, thus reducing chronic diseases and improving general health in the country.

AB Scholars have found differences between older and newer foundations and their giving priorities and strategies, especially in education. Foundations founded in recent decades with still-living benefactors have been more vocal, result-oriented, and focused on education initiatives like charter schools and alternative certification than their older counterparts. In this paper, I examine whether these differing patterns hold for new and old foundation grants to state departments of education, leading new foundations to target contexts politically amenable to education reform while old foundations focus less on politics and more on state need. Using data on the largest 1000 foundations, in addition to grants from the Gates and Wallace Foundations, I find that new, but not old, foundations, are more likely to support education reform policies when giving to state education agencies. I also find that new, but not old, foundations support state education agencies possessing political contexts conducive to education reform as well as higher levels of child poverty. I illustrate these findings with the case of Kentucky. These findings suggest that, by taking advantage of state need while seeking out political allies, new foundations behave like interest groups in their grants to government.

AB This article explains the role of the IGR lobby in the passage of TEA-21 and the nature of the coalitions and partnership formed by groups within the IGR lobby to accomplish their policy goals. The data for the study are divided into three realms. The first identifies the priorities of groups within the IGR lobby and the tapes of coalitions that groups entered into. These data were gathered through examinations of IGR lobby testimony before congressional committees, interviews with organizational and congressional staff members, and from secondary sources such as the official publications and websites of IGR lobby organizations. The second part seeks to gain a more precise understanding of how state and local officials use non-PIG coalitions and groups to press for their policy objectives by surveying selected state and local government officials. Finally, the survey assesses the impact that IGR lobbying had on TEA-21.

ID BELO MONTE DAM; COMMITMENT; ADVOCACY; AGENCY; STATE
AB There is growing interest in how activist bureaucrats change policies; however, it remains unclear how bureaucrats become activists. This article develops a framework for the emergence of bureaucratic activism using the case of Brazilian prosecutors in the Belo Monte dam, a project that drew attention due to its social and environmental impacts. I show that two different types of prosecutors were involved in this case: activist prosecutors, who were committed to the proactive defense of affected communities, and conventional prosecutors, neutral agents that resorted to traditional tactics. Based on 82 interviews, document analysis, and participant observation, I argue that rather than being self-selected, prosecutors within conducive settings engaged in activism after they joined the state by developing long-term ties with local groups. By discovering the problems faced by affected communities and mediating their struggles with other policy actors, prosecutors internalized the grievances of these groups, building commitments to defend their causes.

AB American policymakers delegate the administration of many welfare programs to states, where officials implement them in increasingly diverse ways. Welfare state scholarship has little to say about this subnational policy divergence, and it portrays the complexity of delegated governance as a barrier to nonelite legislative influence. Drawing on an ethnographic study of one state's Medicaid program, this article shows that delegated governance offers ample opportunity for nonelite influence and policy divergence, but through regulatory governance rather than legislative advocacy. Medicaid is opaque to politicians, whose inability to monitor program details creates conditions of bureaucratic autonomy and even activism: health-care agency personnel sequence regulatory tweaks to protect and expand entitlements. But budget cuts, outsourcing, and fraught provider relations also deprive bureaucrats of street-level know-how, and bureaucrats depend on beneficiaries' advocates who selectively illuminate a path to reform. A full rendering of subnational divergence in American federalism requires attention to underexamined factors such as bureaucratic activism, agency advocacy, and regulatory governance.

ID ORGANIZED INTERESTS; CORPORATISM; PRESSURE; DENMARK; ACCESS
AB The article compares the political activities of different types of interest groups. Drawing on data from a survey of all Danish national interest groups, it demonstrates significant variation in the strategic choices of different types of groups. Groups with corporative resources direct much attention towards influencing the bureaucracy. They possess resources valued by officials and therefore have good options for utilizing a strategy targeting the administration and seeking corporatist integration. By contrast, public interest groups are more likely to use publicly visible strategies in which affecting the media agenda plays a central role. By engaging in such strategies, public interest groups can demonstrate a high level of engagement to their diffuse membership. Furthermore, the goals of public interest groups are typically conducive to pursuit through public strategies. A third category of other groups is incorporated in the analyses as a point of reference to establish patterns of strategy use. While there are clear differences between groups with regard to most strategies of influence, different types of groups are equally engaged in a parliamentary strategy. Interacting with Parliament seems to be important for groups integrated in corporatist structures as well as for those relying more on public strategies.

DE developmental disabilities; advocacy; deinstitutionalization; community

AB This paper presents a comparative case study of diverse approaches to deinstitutionalization of developmental disabilities residential services in two Midwestern states. During the 1970s and 1980s, the convergence of leadership by advocates, legislators, and bureaucrats led to Michigan's rapid transformation from an institutional to a community-based system, which was further facilitated by a political culture open to innovation. In contrast, during the same period in Illinois, fragmented leadership by advocates of community services, and the power held by unions, parents of institutionalized children, and private service providers worked for retention of institutions and against development of community residential services. Illinois' political culture, state governmental structure and bureaucracy also actively impeded innovation and further hindered the development of community homes. Implications for today's advocates are drawn from a comparative historical review.

Providing an overview of the literature on minoritized policy advocacy, as well as highlighting the dearth of inquiry on minoritized organizations that engage in policy advocacy on behalf of and in consortium with HBCUs, this article highlights the work of the UNCF, its history, and its evolving role in policy advocacy to combat policy borne out of predominantly White policy arenas. We identify the ways UNCF challenge deficit narratives about HBCUs and the minoritized populations these institutions serve as well as offer concrete strategies and technologies of resistance that can be used for engaging in policy advocacy on behalf of minoritized organizations and communities.

AB A business enterprise interested in influencing the design, adoption or enforcement of a particular law, rule or regulation often confronts a choice. Does it lobby officials directly? Or does it do so indirectly, using a collective action group as an intermediary? We draw on data from a large, 2010 survey of enterprises across the Russian Federation to demonstrate that the propensity to engage in intermediated lobbying increases with region-level political competition. Our explanation builds on recent evidence confirming Mancur Olson's claim (1982) that less encompassing actors tend to lobby for more distortionary policies. We hypothesize that with greater political competition government officials become more responsive to encompassing voices (i.e. associations of businesses as opposed to single firms), since the electoral costs of being captured by narrower interests becomes greater. Evidence from a complementary survey of regional business association managers points in the same direction; the relative attention paid by officials to lobbying efforts by encompassing associations increases with political competition.

AB We analyze a model of policy making in which only one actor (e.g., a bureaucratic agency or a well-funded interest group) has the capacity to develop high-quality policy proposals. By virtue of her skills, this actor has an effective monopoly on policy development and thus can craft proposals that are good for herself but provide few benefits to decision makers who enact policies. We then examine institutional responses that decision makers can use to induce a policy-development monopolist to craft more appealing proposals: (i) establishing in-house policy development capacity, (ii) delegating authority to an agent who counterbalances the monopolist's preferences, and (iii) fostering competition by policy developers with different preferences. We apply our model to a diverse set of contexts, including lobbying in term-limited state legislatures, regulation of banking and financial services, and administrative procedures for rule making in US federal bureaucracies.

AB Public policy is produced by elected and unelected officials and through the interactions of branches of government. We consider how such interactions affect policy implementation and representation. We argue that legislators try to influence bureaucratic decisions through direct communication with federal agencies, and that such contact is effective and has consequences for policy outcomes. We provide empirical evidence of this argument using original data about direct communication between members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) along with decisions made by the DOL regarding trade and redistributive policies. We find that direct contacts influence DOL decisions, and the agency is more likely to reverse previous decisions when requested to do so by legislators. Our results challenge key assumptions and findings in the previous literature and have important implications for interbranch relations and informal means of control over the implementation of national policy.

SO CULTURAL STUDIES

DT Article
DE politics; humanities; academia; policy; Australia; advocacy
AB In addition to his very considerable and influential body of scholarship, and his roles as a pathfinder and senior leader of cultural studies in Australia and beyond, Graeme Turner has made a profound if less well-known contribution as an advocate and adviser at the national level, for cultural studies and the wider humanities. Turner's election in 2004 as President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities was greeted by elements of the conservative commentariat as the final proof of the complete annihilation of sense and meaning in Australian universities. Within four years, Turner had garnered sufficient respect to be appointed personally to the nation's preeminent science and research advisory body, the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, a distinction confirmed by his reappointment in 2012. This article offers an intimate account of Turner's advocacy and policy activities, detailing many of the achievements, along with some of the frustrating near-misses, of his work during and after his Presidency. It traces his development from a seasoned institutional player and accomplished scholar, encountering the dual challenges of slippery politics and leaden bureaucracy, to his rapid emergence as an expert political operator quite at home (if a little cold) in Canberra. The article proposes a theory of Turner's approach, beyond his well-known work ethic, intellectual acuity and force of personality, conceiving of his advocacy and policy work as a species of cultural studies itself - an enactment of a politically engaged cultural practice - as much as an initiative on its behalf. This account looks back to Turner's own cultural scholarship for insights into his deployment of a highly sophisticated intellectual toolkit in a theoretically informed practice, to gain the attention, respect and support of politicians, public servants, industry leaders and the powerful science lobby.

SO HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY

DE Third party nuclear liability; nuclear insurance pools; IAEA; nuclear
   diplomacy
AB Third party liability insurance in the event of nuclear accidents emerged as a pressing issue in the 1950s, triggered to a great extent by the activities of international organizations and major nuclear accidents. By the mid-1960s a tight international network of negotiators comprising insurers, lawyers, scientists, engineers, businessmen, and government officials made its appearance along with nuclear insurance pools. Experts, functionaries, diplomats and politicians with often diverging views and expertise were involved in negotiations over the newly emerging legal and regulatory problems related to radiation protection and third party liability in the event of severe accidents. This paper argues that insurers transformed their identities from lobbyists to backstage nuclear diplomats, making their role explicitly political and profoundly diplomatic in an emerging international nuclear order. Within this novel multilayered context of negotiations the nuclear insurance pools developed a unique form of nuclear diplomacy, altering both terms of 'nuclear' and 'diplomacy'.

ID FOREIGN-POLICY
AB This paper analyses the role of Cuban Americans and Iraqi Americans as allies of like-minded public officials in the marketing of contested foreign policies to the United States public. Each of these ethnic exile communities played a traditional lobbying role as would be expected of interest groups, but the argument here is that the interactive relationship between the ethnic interest groups and government officials in advocating policy is the more interesting development in these cases. While there are differences in the two cases, the similarities between marketing an embargo and an invasion suggest that foreign-policy analysts may want to pay closer attention to the interactive relationship between exile communities and government officials in policy advocacy. I suggest in conclusion that we need to be wary of according defectors and exiles privileged positions in future foreign-policy debates.

AB A key issue for interest groups and policymakers is the ways through which organized interests voice their interests and influence public policy. This article combines two perspectives on interest group representation to explain patterns of interest group access to different political arenas. From a resource exchange perspective, it argues that access to different political arenas is discrete as it is determined by the match between the supply and demands of interest groups and gatekeeperspoliticians, bureaucrats, and reporters. From a partly competing perspective, it is argued that access is cumulative and converges around wealthy and professionalized groups. Based on a large-scale investigation of group presence in Danish political arenas, the analyses show a pattern of privileged pluralism. This describes a system where multiple political arenas provide opportunities for multiple interests but where unequally distributed resources produce cumulative effects (i.e., the same groups have high levels of arena access).

ID STATE CAPACITY; UNITED-STATES; POLITICS
AB Existing studies of state-led industrial development argue that state autonomy is essential for formulating consistent and coherent industrial policies. This article shows that autonomous bureaucracy, while useful for fending off the politics of interest groups, is not free of politics in itself. Using Chinese industrial policy-making as a strategic case study, this article uncovers the competitive dimension of bureaucratic decision-making and the extent to which it serves as a driving force for industrial policy paradigm change in China. Equipped with a theory of policy articulation, this article details the strategies used by multiple superagencies and groups of career bureaucrats to vie for industrial policy authority within the Chinese state. In sum, this article seeks to expose the role of intrabureaucracy competition in mediating international political economic environment and national policy outcomes. Looking forward, this article proposes that the renewed focus on industrial policy by many national governments compels an analytical re-engagement with the role of large bureaucracies in economic decision-making and the kind of organizational and cognitive frameworks by which bureaucrats mobilize to chart our industrial landscapes.

ID INFORMATION
AB The outbreak of Covid-19 provoked a massive shock for political institutions and societal groups. A crucial question is how such an external event affects the balance of access to political gatekeepers. In particular: Are organizations, which are highly affected by the crisis, able to increase their political voice? To address this, we focus on changes in lobbying access to key venues of public policy: government, parliament, the bureaucracy, and the media across 10 European democracies. Based on novel survey data, we assess changes in access shortly after the outbreak of Covid-19. Our findings show that affectedness is an important driver of changes in access to all venues. We interpret this as good news for the functioning of European systems of interest representation, and the ability of gatekeepers to open their doors to affected groups. However, we also show that the effect of affectedness varies considerably for economic and non-economic interests.

TI Public Service or Propaganda? How Americans Evaluate Political Advocacy
   by Executive Agencies
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective Executive agencies of the federal government frequently engage in explicit political advocacy, exhorting the public to adopt policy positions and engage in political actions. This advocacy conflicts with legal restrictions on unelected bureaucrats. It is unclear what the public thinks of this kind of advocacy. We assess whether Americans judge this advocacy based on principles about acceptable political processes or based on policy goals. Methods We use observational and experimental data from two national surveys of American adults to assess the role of policy preferences in acceptance of political advocacy by executive agencies. Findings We find that Americans approve a broad range of public communications from executive agencies, but approval of political appeals is highly sensitive to whether an individual shares the policy goal of the agency. Conclusions Policy agreement, rather than preferences about process, drives Americans' attitudes toward this kind of advocacy. Americans support political advocacy by executive agencies when it dovetails with their own policy preferences or partisanship and oppose it when these agencies advocate for policies that contradict their own preferences or partisanship. Indeed, they do not draw any distinction between unelected bureaucrats and elected politicians when it comes to evaluating these forms of advocacy.

AB Britain's National Health Service (NHS) is a universal, single-payer health system in which the central state has been instrumental in ensuring equity. This article investigates why from the 1970s a policy to achieve equal access for equal need was implemented. Despite the founding principle that the NHS should "universalize the best," this was a controversial policy goal, implying substantial redistribution from London and the South and threatening established medical, political, and bureaucratic interests. Our conceptual approach draws on the advocacy coalition framework (ACF), which foregrounds the influence of research and ideas in the policy process. We first outline the spatial inequities that the NHS inherited, the work of the Resource Allocation Working Party (RAWP), and its new redistributive formula. We then introduce the ACF approach, analyzing the RAWP's prehistory and formation in advocacy coalition terms, focusing particularly on the rise of health economics. Our explanation emphasizes the consensual commitment to equity, which relegated conflict to more technical questions of application. The "buy-in" of midlevel bureaucrats was central to the RAWP's successful alignment of equity with allocative efficiency. We contrast this with the failure of advocacy for equity of health outcomes: here consensus over core beliefs and technical solutions proved elusive.

AB I study the consequences of interest group campaign contributions for administrative oversight. Unlike the few previous studies in this area, however, I study the influence in state bureaucracies and at the level of individual groups. Specifically, I test whether campaign contributions to state elected officials influence the outcomes of annual inspections of skilled nursing facilities in 16 states, leveraging the context of state politics in two important ways. First, I consider the differing effects of contributions to the legislative and executive branches. Second, I argue that legislative capacity for oversight influences the efficacy of contributions Regression analysis of inspection results with controls for facility characteristics provides evidence that contributing facilities have better overall inspection results, with a large reduction in citations for severe problems. Furthermore, contributions to legislators reduce overall problems, particularly in less professionalized legislatures, while those to the governor reduce severe ones.

This requires ethical consideration of the meanings made between clients and providers about client's health and wellbeing, both individually and in the larger society. Health care providers (N = 15) and married women living with HIV (N = 33) in north-central India engaged in separate intensive interviews providing narrative data which were analysed using a conceptual framework crossing Lipsky's street-level bureaucracy theory (Lipsky 2010) with meaning-making processes. HCPs and women construct meanings of women's role as caregivers that impact women's sense of identity, health, and well-being. Findings indicate that despite being well-intentioned, HCPs inadvertently reinforce rigid gender norms and convey that women's worth is tied to their familial caregiving role. HCPs' discretionary advocacy may also reinforce societal images of women as incapable and needy, thereby harming them more generally. Attention to the gender-sensitive training of HIV health care providers may assure that discretion is ethically interrogated to promote gender equity and enhance women's access to social welfare services.

AB This paper investigates how firms' political capabilities and countries' political structures affect firms' lobbying decision. We use a cross-country, firm-level dataset that covers more than 22,013 firms in 46 countries to discover that a firm's individual- and collective-level political capabilities are positively associated with lobbying. In contrast, the degree of checks and balances among bureaucrats in a country's political market is negatively associated with the firm's possibility of lobbying. Finally, we also find that the positive role of a firm's political capabilities in lobbying is mitigated by the degree of checks and balances among bureaucrats. This study contributes to the literature of corporate political activities by filling the research gaps (1) as considering both horizontal and vertical checks and balances among bureaucrats in political markets, and (2) as simultaneously considering firms' individual and collective political capabilities, by taking one more conceptual step on the literature of contingent dynamic capabilities and lobbying.

ID AGENDA
AB Context Despite being a nuclear power, Pakistan does not have satisfactory human development indicators. The 2018 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI) ranking places it at 150 out of 189 countries, the lowest in the region after Afghanistan. Purpose This article examines advocacy journalism coverage of human development issues versus other issues in the contents of mainstream Pakistani newspapers and investigates the factors behind the inadequate space give n to them. The study further explores the association between editorial and readers' priorities. Methods The quantitative content analysis method is used to measure and compare the frequency of sample content in five categories coupled with qualitative in-depth interviews with veteran journalists/academics to explain the factors that influence the editorial content. Findings Rather than use precious space to comment on social hardship and ultimately improve the country's HDI value, editorial content is dominated by the discourse produced by the communication bureaucracies of powerful national and international establishments. Issues-based policies of the state and political actors that do not concern human development, and warmongering and actual conflicts with India and Afghanistan, are given considerably greater coverage. Moreover, readers' reactions to editorial content through Facebook Likes indicate a clear difference between editorial and readers' priorities. Policy Implications The communication aspects of development programmes should actively feed editorial boards regarding current global development agendas to ensure sufficient coverage of their advocacy. It is imperative to make the UNESCO-led syllabus Teaching Journalism for Sustainable Development an integral part of the country's journalism curriculum. Relevant bodies should organize professional editorial training to raise awareness of how to use precious space wisely for the advocacy of development issues and how to be alert to the readers' priority issues.

AB This study explores the evolution of the Green Grants program, run by Brazil's Ministry of Environment, as a means for developing the concept of bureaucratic activism. When the Workers' Party first took office in 2003, many social movement actors joined the government, especially in that agency. After 2007, however, most of these activists left the government. At the same time, the ministry substituted thousands of temporary employees for permanent civil servants. Surprisingly, this study finds that these public employees carried forward the environmentalist cause, even when this required contesting the priorities of superiors. Examining their attitudes and practices leads to a definition of activism as the proactive pursuit of opportunities to defend contentious causes. The case study helps to develop this concept and to demonstrate that workers inside bureaucracies can engage in activist behavior. It also explores the effects of bureaucratic activism on environmental policymaking in Brazil.

ID POLICY; ADVISERS; BRITAIN; IDEAS
AB David Owen, who was appointed as Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary following the death of Anthony Crosland in February 1977, committed the Labour government of Jim Callaghan to a human rights-based foreign policy, stating in his first major speech that Britain would take a 'stand' on human rights violations in every corner of the globe. This ambitious agenda faced a major challenge when, in October 1977, Owen was alerted to the imminent shipment of British Ferret and Saladin armoured vehicles to the repressive Salvadoran regime of Carlos Humberto Romero. By uncovering the machinations that led to the eventual cancellation of the armoured vehicles contract in January 1978, this article explores how the Catholic Institute for International Relations (CIIR) spearheaded a powerful lobbying campaign, bringing the combined pressure of sympathetic journalists, parliamentarians, civil servants, and representatives of the Catholic Church within Britain to bear on the foreign policy establishment. This article therefore contributes towards a greater understanding of Britain's burgeoning human rights network, the connections it cultivated within Whitehall, and the processes through which it was able to effectively subvert traditional modes of foreign policymaking during a 'breakthrough' moment in human rights history.

AB We study the effect of politics on the distribution of intergovernmental grants. We consider a model where local government officials lobby the central government who in turn distributes grants based on the local governments' lobbying efforts. We argue that the marginal costs of lobbying increase with the geographical and 'political' distance from the central government capital. Hence, in equilibrium, grants should decrease with a jurisdiction's distance from the capital. Moreover, grants to a jurisdiction which produces spillover benefits for other jurisdictions will meet less opposition. Therefore, higher spillover benefits will imply more grants to the jurisdiction producing the spillover in equilibrium. Using data from California counties, we find support for our model.

SO LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY

ID POLICE PATROLS; FIRE ALARMS; OVERSIGHT
AB In the United States, an important literature shows that legislators use interest groups, courts, and budgets to assert political control over bureaucrats. Similar theories can be applied to study the scores of new democracies that have emerged in recent decades. in Argentina, politicians in the first administration of Carlos Menem (1989-95) rewrote administrative procedures and relied on both "police patrol" and "fire alarm" oversight to realign the behavior of tax bureaucrats in conformance with their own policy preferences. Whereas U.S. legislators generally prefer complex administrative procedures, different electoral incentives led their Argentine counterparts to support reforms that significantly streamlined those procedures. This finding challenges theories that attribute legislators' bureaucratic preferences to the separation or fusion of powers between the executive and legislative branches.

Within these organizations, persons with relevant lived experience occupy various nonclinical and clinical positions. When facilities incorporate workers with lived experience, managers observe increased levels of trust between clients and service providers, an enhanced client-centered perspective among service providers, and higher quality in the services provided. This study may guide managers in considering how (or whether) human service organizations might institutionalize lived experience as a mechanism to help create a representative bureaucracy.

AB Policy scholars have noted that bureaucrats can play an important role in defining policy alternatives. Few studies, however, examine the extent of their involvement in this process. This study contributes to public policy scholarship by offering a framework for understanding the strength of bureaucratic involvement in the process of defining problems and policy alternatives. Using witness data from congressional hearings on crime between 1947 and 1998, I find that federal, state, and local criminal justice bureaucrats have come to occupy a central role in the process of defining policy alternatives. In addition, I find that the centrality of criminal justice actors comes at the expense of interest groups, community organizations, and citizens/victims. Implications for criminal justice policy and understanding bureaucratic involvement in the policy process are discussed.

AB Comparing Internet diffusion policies in the United States and France from an implementation perspective brings to light institutional and historical differences, even though both countries used the same top-down approach. We find that France not only followed the technological lead of the United States in information technology but also emulated some of its more business-oriented approaches in the implementation of the Internet, despite its own longstanding tradition of government intervention in industrial and commercial matters. This policy shift appears to be spurred by the global economy. Traditionally state-controlled national economies are now increasingly leveraging private interests for successful industrial policy. When applying Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith's advocacy coalition framework to the American and French diffusion of the Internet, we find policy communities actually expanding to private and public actors, including industry captains, legislators, and civil servants. These subsystems work together through classic lawmaking and lobbying under technological and economic constraints.

AB The consolidation of archaeology as a scientific discipline reinforced the power of the nation-state as archaeologists produced material and intellectual data that was used to bolster state identities at the expense of the history and heritage of Indigenous peoples. Accordingly, there are inherent structural inequalities within the discipline that favour researchers from Western nation-states in knowledge creation about the past. In this paper I explore the political implications of advocating for an equitable archaeological practice in Belize, Central America. Though archaeological research has incorporated grassroots engagement and community-based approaches, there is a gap in the discussion about negotiations with government officials. Among the issues surrounding grassroots advocacy is walking a 'middle ground' between negotiating with government officials for excavation permits and working closely with disenfranchised communities. Building relationships between registers of power supports the practice of a socially just archaeology abroad and could mitigate the structural inequalities inherent in our discipline. I illustrate this 'middle ground' with the Aguacate Community Archaeology Project, which I conducted in collaboration with Aguacate village, Toledo district, from 2012 to 2015. I explore the role of the archaeologist as an advocate for local communities' control over knowledge produced on their community land.

AB This article analyzes the recurrent "erosion thesis" in the governance literature, arguing that bureaucratic or procedural public-sector institutions have come to play a less significant role in public-policy formation. Evidence from the Swedish policy-making institutions referred to as "governmental commissions" and adoption of the perspective of interest organizations support the claim. Using various theories of institutional change, I show that increased government control has reduced the influence of governmental commissions on policy, but not eliminated the belief held by interest organizations that the commissions are legitimate institutions.

AB Different interest groups play a role in regulatory governance. One frequently neglected is the group of professionals that run regulatory agencies and pursue regulatory goals. The objective of this paper is to give "regulocrats" center stage. It interprets data from a survey conducted by Brazilian institutions, shedding light on the major preferences of the "regulocrats", and on how they go about implementing policy and interacting with other actors. Data is combined with a state capacity perspective so as to elaborate on the findings. The paper concludes by articulating an idea of a particular kind of hybridism in the Brazilian "regulocracy".

AB Under political uncertainty, legislative coalitions have incentives to insulate policy from future coalitions. While there is evidence of legislators' use of agency design to insulate the bureaucracy from elected officials, little is known about the ultimate consequences of such design choices on the policy participation of interest groups. How such design choices affect group access is important because of the centrality of groups in providing both bureaucratic accountability and information for policy development. Accordingly, we examine the consequences of the so-called "insulation game" on group access to the bureaucracy. We develop an information exchange theory that portrays the impact of agency design choices on group-reported access as a function of the level of design-induced political insulation and the quality of the information offered by a given group. We test our theory with two original datasets that include design parameters of US state environmental agencies and survey data measuring reported agency access by state-level interest groups. Our results suggest that insulating agencies via design does lead to lower reported access to regulators by interest groups, but only among those groups who supply less valuable information.

AB Interest groups may approach political decision makers in two phases of the legislative process: the pre-parliamentary, administrative phase, in which bills are prepared by bureaucrats; and the parliamentary phase, in which bills are discussed and possibly revised by parliamentary committees. The article investigates the factors that lead groups to engage in these phases based on group proceedings for 225 bills presented to the Danish parliament in the 2009/2010 session. We conclude that resourceful groups are clearly more active in both arenas, but the parliamentary arena is also a venue for voicing discontent and defending gains achieved in the administrative arena.

These interest groups include environmentalists, citizen activists, the timber and mining industries, range users, tribal representatives, and recreationists, Gender, race, and career path are demonstrated to be significant factors related to NFS employee beliefs about a number of these interest groups. These results suggest that NFS employee diversification policies may have introduced into the workforce a set of employees who are less positive in their expectations of the timber industry, but more positive about environmentalists and some other key interest groups. This shift is predicted to aid the NFS in working more successfully with a wider diversity of external constituencies than in the past.

AB We study, theoretically and empirically, legislative influence over executive agencies, focusing on the breadth of agency responsibilities. We model interest groups, the legislature, and agencies. Politicians exert costly effort to influence agencies in exchange for interest groups' campaign contributions. Effort, however, can only be imperfectly targeted. When effort is spent on behalf of one group, some spills over to benefit other interest groups. This creates externalities of influence that are larger in broad agencies, deterring legislative influence. Empirically, we develop a novel lobbying-based measure of breadth and combine it with survey data on influence in 70 US federal agencies. Broad agencies report less influence, and we rule out several alternative explanations. These results are important for understanding how to insulate divisive tasks from political influence.

AB More than ever before, analysts in government have access to policy-relevant research and advocacy, which they consume and apply in their role in the policy process. Academics have historically occupied a privileged position of authority and legitimacy, but some argue this is changing with the rapid growth of think tanks and research-based advocacy organizations. This article documents the findings from a randomized controlled survey experiment using policy analysts from the British Columbia provincial government in Canada to systematically test the source effects of policy research in two subject areas: minimum wage and income-splitting tax policy. Subjects were asked to read research summaries of these topics and then assess the credibility of each article, but for half of the survey respondents the affiliation/authorship of the content was randomly reassigned. The experimental findings lend evidence to the hypothesis that academic research is perceived to be substantially more credible than think tank or advocacy organization research, regardless of its content. That increasingly externalized policy advice systems are not a pluralistic arena of policy research and advice, but instead subject to powerful heuristics that bureaucrats use to sift through policy-relevant information and advice, demands added nuance to both location and content-based policy advisory system models.

ID ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES; BUREAUCRATIC DISCRETION; LOBBYISTS; EXPERTISE
AB Important conceptualizations of both interest groups and bureaucratic agencies suggest that these institutions provide legislatures with greater information for use in policy-making. Yet little is known about how these information Sources interact in the policy process as a whole. In this paper we consider this issue analytically, and develop a model of policy-making in which multiple sources of information - from the bureaucracy, an interest group, or a legislature's own in-house development can be brought to bear on policy. Lobbyists begin this process by selecting a venue - Congress or a standing bureaucracy - in which to press for a policy change. The main findings of the paper are that self-selection of lobbyists into different policy-making venues can be informative per se, and that this self-selection can make legislatures prefer delegation to ideologically distinct bureaucratic agents over ideologically close ones. Changes within the Federal Trade Commission during the 1970s are reinterpreted in the context of our model.

ID INTEREST-GROUP PERSPECTIVE; LEGISLATION; GOVERNMENT; POLITICS
AB This interdisciplinary study finds that the way laws are written and treated by state regulators measurably affects bureaucratic performance: the care taken by legislatures and state agencies in developing domestic elder abuse law affects how lower-level bureaucrats investigate and reporte abuse. Perhaps more interesting, however, are two robust findings about state law making. Both legislator characteristics ( here, being middle-aged or slightly older) and lobbying by seemingly the most important interest group ( here, the American Association of Retired Persons [AARP]) sometimes have an unexpected effect. We surmise that these legislators and lobbyists find other issues both more politically attractive and more pressing since elder abuse is almost exclusively confined to the very old and helpless. However, the presence of state AARP lobbyists does predict more concern for the elderly at the administrative level. The difference between legislative and regulatory lobbying may thus reflect the differing public scrutiny given to the two.

AB Why do some interest groups lobby politicians and others lobby bureaucrats ? We theorize lobbying venue choices and intensity as a function of contract enforceability with policy makers, politicians, or bureaucrats. We argue that organizational structures of interest groups, in particular, whether they are centralized or decentralized, substantially affect their lobbying strategies because they are associated with different ability to monitor and enforce contracts with policy makers and punish them when they fail. We further demonstrate that the effect of centralized versus decentralized structure on venue choices is conditional on the types of electoral system: majoritarian, semiproportional (single, nontransferable vote: SNTV), or proportional representation systems. We test this argument using longitudinal survey data on lobbying which span two decades and cover around 250 interest groups in various sectors and issue areas in Japan. The results lend strong support to our argument about contract enforceability under alternative electoral systems.

ID CHOICE
AB Social policy scholarship assumes that left-wing governments favour a stronger public provision of services, while right-wing politics promote privatization, largely as a matter of ideology. Yet the findings on Canadian provinces' market-based housing instruments suggest that alternative views are possible. Left-leaning governments introduced private delivery mechanisms for economic as well as non-economic reasons. The archival research and thematic analysis of interview responses with key actors (n = 56) suggest that the introduction of housing allowances in the policy toolbox largely results from bureaucratic initiatives, regardless of the party in power. Rather than political forces or advocacy by power interests, this policy change is mostly driven by considerations of equity and efficiency on the part of officials 'muddling through'. The concept is revisited in the final discussion, where important strands of the privatization literature are challenged, as well as the political assumptions associated with the notion of users' freedom.

AB CFSP has traditionally been studied as a policy-making domain that is reserved to negotiations among formal representatives from the EU and its member states. In this article, we draw attention to the way in which the CFSP bureaucracy interacts with transnational actors from civil society. We conceptualize this relationship on the basis of three mechanisms: access to European policy-making in return for information, coalition building dynamics, and socialization processes. We illustrate the importance of these mechanisms for the EU's policy on the International Criminal Court (ICC). Specifically, we argue that NGOs have gained routine access to the COJUR-ICC working group, where they have obtained a prominent status as experts, participating in information exchange coalition building dynamics. This has also translated into NGO influence on important aspects of the EU's foreign policy towards the ICC.

AB Why does a state change its foreign policy objectives and who is responsible for instigating such change? According to Hermann, four primary change agents are central to this process: leaders, bureaucracies, changes in domestic constituencies, and external shocks. This paper argues that the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) is a complementary policy process framework that can explain foreign policy change (FPC) and that accounts for all four of these primary change agents. Additionally, it is a broader framework of the policy process that facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing FPC than traditional FPC research. The ACF has the potential to broaden our understanding of FPC by emphasizing the intersection of the international system with domestic politics and focusing on a myriad of policy actors coordinating their advocacy efforts to influence FPC. To support this argument, the paper discusses how FPC can benefit from the ACF and reviews past applications. It proposes a research agenda using the ACF to study FPC and draws conclusions about future challenges and directions.

SO POLITICS & GENDER
LA English
DT Article

AB While there has been a significant amount of research on transnational feminist activism at the global level, many feminist transnational advocacy networks are mobilizing within world regions. The lack of attention to the regional level has created a considerable imbalance in research on transnational activism. This article's first objective is to define regional advocacy networks (RANs) as a collection of individuals and organizations from the same world region working together toward a common goal. The article's second objective is to explore the conditions under which RANs are influential. We investigate conditions for RAN success through a case study of an African network that helped create one of the world's most progressive treaties on women's rights, the African Union Protocol to the Charter on Human and People's Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. From an analysis of primary sources and interviews with key participants, we suggest that three factors are crucial for network success: whether a RAN builds alliances with key politicians and civil servants, whether a RAN is able to participate in the decision-making process, and whether a RAN's goals overlap with the target institution's priorities. The broader implication of our study is that scholars seeking to understand the creation of women's rights commitments, the diffusion of women's rights norms, and compliance with women's rights treaties need to look beyond the international and domestic levels of action to include the regional level in their analyses.

AB Mexico is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of obesity and recently declared a national epidemic of diabetes. Healthy food environments have the potential to improve the diet of the population and decrease the burden of disease. The aim of the study was to assess the efforts of the Mexican Government towards creating healthier food environments using the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI). The tool was developed by the International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS). Then, it was adapted to the Latin-American context and assessed the components of policy and infrastructure support. Actors from academia, civil society, government, and food industry assessed the level of implementation of food policies compared with international best practices. Actors were classified as (1) independents from academia and civil society (n = 36), (2) government (n = 28), and (3) industry (n = 6). The indicators with the highest percentage of implementation were those related to monitoring and intelligence. Those related to food retail were rated lowest. When stratified by type of actor, the government officials rated several indicators at a higher percentage of implementation compared with independent actors. None of the indicators were rated at high implementation. Government officials and independent actors agreed upon nine priority actions to improve the food environment in Mexico. These actions have the potential to improve government commitment and advocacy efforts to create healthier food environments.

AB Interest group research has focused extensively on political access. While access does not guarantee influence, it is customarily seen as a crucial step towards gaining political influence. It is argued that groups with access are, all else equal, more likely to be influential than groups without access. Biased access may thus result in biased influence. On the basis of a review of this literature, the article shows how the concept of access rests on an intuitive understanding rather than an explicit definition. This hampers methodological discussions of measurement. We propose to define access as instances where a group has entered a political arena (parliament, administration, or media) passing a threshold controlled by relevant gatekeepers (politicians, civil servants, or journalists). On the basis of this discussion, we compare operationalisations based on our proposed definition with some of the major alternatives found in the literature.

   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE lobbyism; groups of interests; acts; transparent policy
AB The term "lobbyism" comes from the English word "lobby" meaning a narrow corridor in English Parliament (building) where deputies could communicate in an informal situation. The political shade got this term only at the end of the XVIII century in the United States of America. At the beginning of the 1820th years the term "lobbyism" was used for definition of local groups, influencing the authorities of the country for the purpose of advance of own interests. Nowadays the USA is the only state in the world that secures lobbying constitutionally and regulates it by means of various federal laws. At the same time each US state has its own regulations establishing the rules for lobbying activities. Despite the federal law lobbying is still banned in some states. This is not surprising since the USA has fifty governments, various political subcultures and levels of political and economic development, so in each state the experience of lobbying regulation has its own characteristics. It is also important to note that the state supervision of lobbying is limited by four fundamental functions: 1) establishing general requirements for registration; 2) establishing criteria for defining a professional lobbyist; 3) establishing of common reporting mechanisms. American states oversight of lobbying generally takes four forms. States establish registration requirements by defining what lobbying is and who is a lobbyist; they require lobbyists or the interests that hire them to periodically disclose their expenditures and earnings; they regulate the 'revolving door' between government and the private sector by establishing a cooling-off period during which ex-government officials are prohibited from lobbying the government they once served and they define the range of permissible lobbying activities, such as providing free gifts or meals. As we can see, there are substantial differences across the varying American States when it comes to regulating lobbyists and lobbying behavior. Moreover because of the importance of State government in the United States, regulations at the state level are in many ways equally if not more important than the federal regulations.

AB Research in the social sciences received generous patronage in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Research was widely perceived as providing solutions to emerging social problems. That generosity came under increased contest in the late 1970s. Although these trends held true for all of the social sciences, this essay explores the various ways by which economists in particular reacted to and resisted the patronage cuts that were proposed in the first budgets of the Reagan administration. Economists' response was three fold: to engage in joint lobbying with other social scientists, to tap into their authority as a respected policy player, and to influence the types of research financed by the patron. With interviews of the former lobbyist for the social scientists, the former director of the Economics program for the National Science Foundation, and a review of the archival records of economists and their scholarly society, we discuss how economists have claimed entitlement to patronage in the closing decades of the twentieth century. We observe a dynamic and productive relationship between politicians and researchers mediated by the National Science Foundation, where civil servants, lobbyist and public minded scientists, and self-serving grantees trade roles.

AB Non-communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, are the leading cause of decreased life expectancy and death in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although a lifestyle, which includes no tobacco use, good nutrition, and regular physical activity is touted as key to health, the environmental, racial, social and economic conditions, which underpin lifestyle are often ignored or considered only secondarily. Placing the main responsibility on a patient to change their lifestyle or to simply comply with pharmacological treatment ignores the specific conditions in which the individual lives. Furthermore, there are major disparities in access to both healthy living conditions as well as access to medical care.
   There is sufficient evidence to support advocating for policies that support healthy living, particularly healthy food choices. Progress is being made to improve the food environment with enactment of front of package nutritional labels. However, policies were enacted only after intense regional research and advocacy supporting their implementation.
   Government officials must rise above the pressures of commercial interests and support health-promoting policies or be exposed as self-interest groups themselves. Strong advocacy is required to persuade officials that all policies should take health into consideration both to improve lives and economies.

AB America's current national political system got much of its shape from transformations engendered between 1960 and 1980. Owing to the rise in education levels among all Americans and the need for professional legislators, bureaucrats, legislative and professional staff, judges, and lobbyists, America witnessed the rise of "professional government" to carry out ever-growing governmental responsibilities. These governing professionals are an elite built on merit through occupational accomplishment, and many of them seek to rule regardless of voter participation. This has furthered the sense of disconnect among the public and created a self-reinforcing chain. Popular discontent and professional government are central and related features of the contemporary American political system.

AB Vested interests have been blamed for resisting the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China. Yet, various interest groups have heterogeneous interests in privatization. Using both firm- and provincial-level data, we find that SOE managers and local bureaucrats-two key players of privatization-have contingent, rather than vested, interests in privatization, depending partly on their political connections with the central government. On the one hand, political connections motivate SOE managers to privatize more state ownership while retaining managerial control. On the other hand, central connections discourage provincial leaders from using privatization to boost their economic performance. These results shed light on the conditions under which China implements its economic reforms. With the increasing embeddedness and declining autonomy for policymakers, the once well-performing developmental state models now face serious challenges as politically powerful interest groups can manipulate economic reforms for their own purposes rather than for structural transformation.

Under what conditions do the European public affairs employees of a leading multinational firm endorse, manage, and promote an active position in the Brussels' polity sphere? This article highlights the process by which these 'professionals of Europe' adapt to the specific requirements of the EU and mobilise an informal network to contribute to European policy-making. These lobbyists appear as 'double entrepreneurs': as entrepreneurs on behalf of both their employers' interests and the European cause as they place themselves as the auxiliaries of EU civil servants. Maintaining a delicate balance, interest representatives occupy a position of dependence, both on their employer and on the polity field in which they valorise their 'European institutional capital'. This position allows these social agents to serve as a broker between their employer and the European arena. In doing so, they nurture the porosity between (economic) interests and the public sector, which cuts across the field of 'Eurocracy'.

ID POLITICS; BUREAUCRACY; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNMENT
AB Do agency officials hold influence over the policy decisions made by state legislators and governors? For years, scholars have asserted the important informational role that bureaucrats play within the U.S. policy-making process. However, we have only limited knowledge of the theoretical mechanisms that may allow for this influence, or ultimately, whether this influence matters to public policy outcomes. We theorize that the political oversight of the bureaucracy by elected officials not only constrains the bureaucracy but also provides a pathway for agency officials to advance their preferences by communicating their policy expertise. We assess this argument with survey data from almost 600 state agency heads, drawn from the 50 states and across all agency types. Using a multilevel model, we find that the "oversight mechanism" is a key driver of agency influence over gubernatorial policy decisions; however, it does a poor job explaining agency policy influence within state legislatures. These results suggest that oversight allows agency leaders greater success in lobbying governors than more diffuse and diverse state legislatures.

AB While nonprofit organizations are frequently understood as influencing policy through advocacy, the policy influence of nonprofit service provision has not been widely acknowledged within the context of the policy process. In spite of this oversight, nonprofit organizations have significant discretion over the publicly funded services they provide, and public policy is continuously shaped through nonprofit service delivery. Furthermore, nonprofit organizations frequently embody the roles of interest group and policy implementer simultaneously. The advocate-provider framework presented here situates these concurrent nonprofit functions within the policy process context. This framework connects research and theory across policy process, public management, and nonprofit management scholarship. The advocate-provider perspective challenges assumptions from existing scholarship while highlighting the need for future research that jointly investigates nonprofit advocacy, public service provision, and policy processes.

AB How do key policy professionals inside government view various sources of policy research? Are there systematic differences in the perceptions of the quality and credibility of research derived from different sources? This is a replication of and expansion on Doberstein (2017), which presented a randomized controlled survey experiment using policy analysts to systematically test the source effects of policy research. Doberstein's experimental findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that academic research is perceived to be substantially more credible to government policy analysts than think tank or advocacy organization research, regardless of its content, and that sources perceived as more ideological are much less credible. This study replicates that experiment in three additional Canadian provincial governments to verify whether the relationship found in the original study persists in a larger sample and in conjunction with further randomization procedures. This study corroborates the original study's findings, confirming that external policy advice systems are subject to powerful heuristics that bureaucrats use to sift through evidence and advice.

DE Kyrgyzstan; bureaucracy; political elite; corruption
AB One of the most important features that distinguishes ideal type bureaucracy from patrimonial bureaucracies is their relations with politics. These relations, determined within the constitutional framework, can operate in informal ways in some countries where traditional authorities are settled. Today, despite the existence of democratic rules and institutions in neopatrimonial countries, the ruling elites can influence bureaucracy within the scope of informal relations. In Kyrgyzstan, it is mentioned about the politics-bureaucracy relationship that takes shape around the presidents elected by the consensus of interest groups. These relationship networks, which differ from time to time, can also turn into compromises between local leadership structures and political elites. In such a system, personal relations come to the fore in the implementation of human resources functions such as hiring, appointment and dismissal in bureaucratic institutions. Therefore, it can be seen that the country's bureaucracy is inefficient, ineffective and unsuccessful. The main purpose of neopatrimonial relations is to obtain scarce resources in the country. For this reason, conflicts over the sharing of interests cause popular movements and power changes in the country.

TI Democratization and bureaucratic restructuring in Taiwan
SO STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Taiwan has been moving toward democracy, with a dramatic transition taking place in the past decade. Critical to this transition is a restructuring of the relation ship between the state bureaucracy and society. This study focuses on democratization's effect on Taiwan's bureaucracy. In particular, it seeks to examine such aspects of bureaucratic transformation as bureaucratic decisionmaking, legislative-bureaucratic politics, interest group-bureaucratic relations, the expansion of local autonomy, and civil service reform. This study finds that the bureaucratic state is facings a great challenge from political, legislative, and societal forces. The old type of insulated bureaucratic planning and decision making is no longer possible, the bureaucracy is losing its KMT patrons, and bureaucrats are finding themselves answerable to political pressure, legislative oversight, and interest group lobbying. While the bureaucracy has lost its previous level of discretion in terms of macro-management and the formulation of developmental policies, the bureaucratic state has not withered away.

AB The use of scientific information in the policy-making process is prevalent in today's society, and political figures frequently consult scientists and experts when considering complex issues like climate change. While policy process literature concerning agenda setting and policy networks, such as epistemic communities and advocacy coalitions, considers the role of scientists in policymaking, very little work has provided insight into the relative influence and perceived relationships between scientists and policymakers. The ability of scientists and policymakers to work together has important implications for policy outcomes. We explore individual scientist's perceptions of the collective influence the scientific community has on policymaking, in addition to perceptions of relationships between scientists and policymakers. We suggest that a number of factors are relevant including trust, contact, attitudes, specialisation and demographics. Our findings indicate that, from scientists' perspectives, contact with policymakers, trust and attitudes about climate change play a significant role in shaping their relationship with policymakers.

AB Previous research has concluded that ownership of economic resources that are politically valued leads to preferential outcomes during interactions with government officials. However, how the political context, and specifically the roles of the government actors involved, influences the relationship between political valued resources (PVRs) and desired outcomes has to date been relatively unexplored. In our paper, we argue that in interactions with elected legislators, PVRs are much more likely to lead to preferential outcomes. Conversely, due to the lack of power these resources have with bureaucrats in charge of regulatory enforcement, PVRs are less likely to lead to preferential outcomes. We provide some support for our arguments by looking for shifting patterns of effects in outcome variables that typically fall under the jurisdiction of each political role type. We find that large firms, export firms, and technology firms largely report having favorable influence over laws and regulations due to lobbying and increased foreign ownership, while also spending more days in inspections and more managerial time dealing with regulations.

ID AFRICA
AB This article tests the theory of advocates who celebrate the potential of civil society to promote and deepen democracy in Africa, by examining whether the human rights ministry of a Catholic parish in Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya was able to consolidate democracy through a civic education programme during 2002-5. It concludes, from an analysis of the social, economic and political environment in Kibera, that parishioners who participated in the programme demonstrated an observable improvement in their democratic values and behaviour at a localised level within their own parish groups. However, civic education did not stimulate most participants to increase their involvement in advocacy and lobbying efforts to hold government officials to account for their abuse of power in Kibera. Parishioners were inhibited from promoting their rights primarily due to fears of violent retaliation by local government officials and politically sponsored youth wingers. Other factors such as apathy, ethnic divisions, limited resources and restrictive church protocols further curtailed parishioners' actions.

AB Policy entrepreneurs-individuals who champion a policy and engage in intense advocacy to secure it-are most frequently characterized as political elites or individuals well connected to such elites. However, an emerging literature suggests that street-level bureaucrats who deliver government services to the public can also prosecute policy entrepreneurship. There has been little investigation of how these actors differ from elite-level policy entrepreneurs who focus on agenda-setting and initial policy approval. Evidence from six case vignettes from US state wetland policy suggest that street-level policy entrepreneurs are distinguished by defensive motivation, greater constancy of effort, recruitment of a less politically powerful network of supporters, and challenges associated with cultivating ties to external resource providers and intra-governmental allies. Street-level policy entrepreneurship helps explain policy innovation within bureaucracies and by bureaucrats, offering new insight into the motivation and behaviours of ground-level officials whose day-to-day choices shape policy.

AB In considering issue expertise in policymaking, we unpack differences in the supply and types of expertise with attention to the presumed privileged role of the bureaucracy. Our empirical investigation is based on witness testimonies of congressional hearings for a policy area involving various forms of expertise - critical infrastructure protection policymaking. Three sets of findings stand out. One set substantiates the role of the bureaucracy as an important information conduit while also showing it is not a primary source of issue expertise. A second set shows how differences in issue maturity and salience affect the demand for and supply of expertise. A third set illustrates the influence of a small cadre of hyper-expertise in drawing attention to problems and solutions across different venues. These findings challenge the conventional view of the bureaucracy in policymaking while expanding the understanding of different sources of information and types of issue expertise in policymaking.

ID HEALTH-INSURANCE; REFORM; DIFFUSION; POLITICS; BRAZIL
AB The notion of "regulatory capture" is typically used to describe the takeover of state agencies by outside interest groups that seek to weaken regulation and advance the agendas of interest groups through control over state policy levers. This concept can be contrasted with that of "developmental capture" of state agencies by networks of reformist bureaucrats within the state who seek to promote inclusive state social and developmental policies of benefit to the broader populace. Building on work that has pointed to instances in which state bureaucrats act autonomously from societal and political pressures, this article argues that existing explanations are insufficient for explaining Thailand's universal health care policy. It points to the critical role played by a network of bureaucrats within the state who strategically mobilized resources in the bureaucracy, political parties, civil society, and international organizations to institutionalize universal health care in the face of broader professional dissent, political uncertainty, and international pressure.

SO LAW AND SOCIAL INQUIRY-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION

ID LAW
AB This article analyzes the relationship between how rationality is conceived and hour democracy is practiced in the Bureau of Reclamation, a water development agency in the Department of Interior. The efforts of some inside the agency to institutionalize rational decision-making models, partly in response to new environmental law, expanded the number and range of interest groups that participated in its decisions by incorporating their preferences into their models for evaluating plans. But the terms under which people could express their values and interests were strictly controlled in ways that some felt misrepresented their concerns. How we conceive of rationality has important implications for how and which people are included in bureaucratic decision making.

TI Cleavages and co-operation in the UK alcohol industry: A qualitative
   study
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Alcohol; Industry; Policy influence; Lobbying; Minimum pricing
ID CIRRHOSIS MORTALITY-RATES; POLICY; BRITAIN
AB Background: It is widely believed that corporate actors exert substantial influence on the making of public health policy, including in the alcohol field. However, the industry is far from being monolithic, comprising a range of producers and retailers with varying and diverse interests. With a focus on contemporary debates concerning the minimum pricing of alcohol in the UK, this study examined the differing interests of actors within the alcohol industry, the cleavages which emerged between them on this issue and how this impacted on their ability to organise themselves collectively to influence the policy process. We conducted 35 semi-structured interviews between June and November 2010 with respondents from all sectors of the industry as well as a range of nonindustry actors who had knowledge of the alcohol policy process, including former Ministers, Members of the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, civil servants, members of civil society organisations and professionals.
   Methods: The paper draws on an analysis of publicly available documents and 35 semi-structured interviews with respondents from the alcohol industry (on-and off-trade including retailers, producers of wines, spirits and beers and trade associations) and a range of non-industry actors with knowledge of the alcohol policy process (including former Ministers, Members of Parliament and of the Scottish Parliament, civil servants, members of civil society organisations and professional groups). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using Nvivo qualitative analysis software. Processes of triangulation between data sources and different types of respondent sought to ensure we gained as accurate a picture as possible of industry participation in the policy process.
   Results: Divergences of interest were evident between producers and retailers and within the retail sector between the on and off trade. Divisions within the alcohol industry, however, existed not only between these sectors, but within them. Cleavages were evident within the producer sector between different product categories and within the retail sector between different types of off-trade retailers. However, trade associations were particularly important in providing a means by which the entire industry, or broad sectors within it, could speak with a single voice, despite the limitations on this. There was also evidence of ad-hoc cooperation on specific issues, which resulted from both formal and informal contacts between industry actors.
   Conclusions: Alcohol industry corporations and trade associations collaborate with one another effectively where there are shared interests, allowing the best placed bodies to lead on a given issue. Thus, whilst industry actors may be deeply divided on certain issues they are able to coordinate their positions on occasions where there are clear advantages in so doing. Health policymakers may benefit from an awareness of the multiplicity of interests within the industry and the ways that these may shape collective lobbying positions.

AB In recent years, U.S. state and federal legislation reflect a deepening recognition of the need to engage youth in decision-making as a mechanism to enhance child welfare policy and practice. This study examined stakeholder views on the key elements and challenges of youth participation in policy advocacy in the context of a multi-state current and former foster care youth coalition. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, focus groups, observations, and document review. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Key elements included a youth-adult partnership model, relationships and networking, having a voice and feeling heard, collective power, and reciprocity among states. Challenges included recruitment, attendance and retention of youth, staff workload issues, and the bureaucracy of child welfare. Findings are discussed in the context of the extent literature.

TI Making Policy with Bureaucrats and Experts: The Dilemma of Citizen
   Members in the Participatory Pension Reforms in Japan
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Documenting how the Japanese state responded to increasing social discontent during initiation of unpopular welfare reforms, this study examines the factors that hindered the political empowerment of civil society despite the timely introduction of participatory policymaking institutions. The Japanese government opted in the early 2000s to introduce a participatory method to initiate the unpopular pension reform. Deliberation councils were established to encourage open discussions among government policymakers and committee members, including citizen representatives. The final outcomes of the deliberations, however, were mostly about parametric adjustments and did not adequately consider the urgent demand of the general public. The participatory measure did not significantly improve the public's trust in the pension programs, but it did justify the government's reform initiatives. The welfare bureaucracy that set the goal, defined the scope of the agenda, and steered the discussions toward technical issues structurally restricted the voices of the citizen members in the deliberation councils. The lack of citizen advocacy groups, which could otherwise have effectively supported the citizen members on the committee, contributed to the limited roles and influences of the citizens. It is argued that the traditional conservative corporatism of Japan was reinforced during this time period, despite the introduction of the idea of participatory governance.

ID STRUCTURAL POWER; SUPERVISION; GOVERNMENT; ATTENTION; IDENTITY; DESIGN
AB We tend to overlook the linkages between how policy coordination within bureaucracy is achieved and the nontrivial implications of policy coordination for business power over the policy process. This article addresses this gap by exploring macroprudential regulatory governance in Turkey. Drawing on elite interviews and written sources, the article argues that analytically and operationally more capable and politically endorsed central bank subordinated the autonomous bank regulator, as the latter assumed a de facto regulatory intermediary role between the former and the regulatee. Within this setting, the regulatee could not rely on its structural and institutional power for mobilization of instrumental power to contest and overturn macroprudential measures. The article contributes to our understanding of the conditions of policy coordination within bureaucracy, how de jure regulator could be subordinated as a de facto regulatory intermediary, and why influential business power needs both a politically and bureaucratically enabling setting.

TI Germany: an intertwined two-part system of unilateralism and collective
   bargaining
SO LABOR HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
DE Germany; industrial relations; public sector; civil service; collective
   bargaining
AB Public sector industrial relations in Germany consist of two parts. On the one hand, wages and working conditions for civil servants are unilaterally determined by law, and on the other, there is a completely developed industrial relations system for non-civil servants (employees) working in the sector. Remarkably, although they have no right to take industrial action, civil servants are not in a worse situation than employees. In view of a simple concept of industrial relations where employers and workers are in complementary labour market roles, this seems difficult to explain. Indeed, public sector industrial relations are more complex. The article suggests that bargaining in the public sector is less an economic procedure than a dispute over the political, societal and statutory recognition of public services and an adequate participation of employees. Being aware of this special character of public sector industrial relations, the United Services Trade Union (Ver.di) tries to back strikes by organising societal support, whereas the German Federation of Civil Servants (DBB) operates more by lobbying in the political sphere and by recourse to the constitution. In spite of a general decline in collective bargaining and trade union density, and long years of austerity, both types of industrial relations are relatively stable.

This study proposes a theoretical framework that integrates the political environment into concepts of turnover intent among public sector employees based on research examining open systems and the administrative presidency. The framework is then explored through interviews with federal employees, former appointees, and lobbyists to understand the impacts of the broad political environment on individuals.

AB Over the past decade, public policies on prostitution and other types of sex work have been increasingly contested, both in academia and in popular debates. One perspective, the oppression paradigm, is increasingly reflected in media reporting on the sex industry and is steadily being articulated by government officials in the USA, Europe, and elsewhere. The proliferation of myths based on the oppression paradigm is responsible for the rise of a resurgent mythology of prostitution. This article examines the claims made by organizations, activists, and scholars who embrace the oppression paradigm, evaluates the reasoning and evidence used in support of their claims, and highlights some of the ways in which this perspective has influenced recent legislation and public policy in selected nations. The author presents an alternative perspective, the polymorphous paradigm, and suggests that public policy on prostitution would be better informed by this evidence-based perspective.

AB This paper describes types, processes and importance of rent-seeking in the allocation of timber rights in Ghana. It is based on an analysis of 30 interviews with large-, medium- and small-scale timber firms, as well as government officials and timber industry organizations in Ghana. The paper documents that timber rights allocation is associated with both bureaucratic and political corruption. The latter comes in two forms. First, the findings suggest that well-established relationships exist between politicians and senior bureaucrats on the one side and large-scale timber firms on the other involving exchange of timber rights for political support and/or material, personal benefits. Second, timber rights are allocated to persons or firms outside the timber sector allegedly as payment for political support. The paper concludes that the Voluntary Partnership Agreement between Ghana and the EU is likely to reduce the observed practises in the future through increased transparency.

AB An underappreciated way members of Congress represent interests is by pursuing policy goals through their communication with the bureaucracy. I argue that the bureaucracy provides an alternative, covert way for cross-pressured legislators, who face diverging pressures from party leaders, interest groups, and subconstituencies, to satisfy conflicting interests. Using original data of senators' communication with the US Department of Labor from 2005 to 2012 (109th through 112th Congresses), I show that, when faced with cross-pressures from party and constituency, senators strategically choose less visible, back-channel means for pursuing policy goals. These findings provide a new perspective on representation by demonstrating that legislators pursue policy goals outside of the legislative process in an effort to evade accountability.

DE veterans; interest groups; bureaucracy; power
AB A synopsis of the state of affairs of the Vietnam veterans lobby illustrates that veterans' interest-group activity is filled with conflict. First, we acknowledge the efforts of the veterans' community before Vietnam. Second, we summarize the activism that developed during the Vietnam decade, noting the conflict between the World War II/Korea veterans and the Vietnam "Homecomers."(1) That clash provided the rationale for two bureaucratic "wars" over control of veterans' policy, programs, budgets, and the client base of Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans: one involving the (then) Veterans Administration (VA) and Health, Education, and Welfare over veterans' educational programs, the other involving the VA and Department of Labor over veteran outreach centers. We summarize two salient issues: Agent Orange and small-business opportunities. Finally, we illustrate that the difficulties confronted by the Vietnam generation also confront the Gulf War/Afghanistan and Iraq veterans. We conclude with comments about the possible future of the veterans as an interest group and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

AB Over the last three decades, the United States has increasingly devolved social policy decisions from the federal to the state level. These changes have resulted in substantial variation in policy decisions and related outcomes. Just as the changes allow states to act as policy laboratories, they also offer a window into the process by which organized interests take advantage of such opportunities to influence state-level policy. This study uses the Advocacy Coalition Framework to illuminate the black box of policy change with a comparative study of two states, Washington and Pennsylvania, which adopted "Employment First" policy aimed at prioritizing employment services for individuals with disability. The study reveals that policy change in both states was associated with organized stakeholder mobilization, strategic framing and narrative, and bureaucratic activism, all in an environment of heightened stakeholder attention to the issue. That said, the two states followed distinct paths, with early policy change in Washington stemming from service provider mobilization, suggesting the importance of policy feedback mechanisms.

AB Objective: We aim to reflect on the introduction of risk-based approaches to public health, driven by legislation outlining the expected local government public health functions and roles by identifying factors that most influenced organisational change within the Western Australia local government sector when developing and submitting child and young people's health and social policy to an annual Awards program.
   Methods: This paper uses 10 years of data from a WA-based Local Government Policy Awards scheme to identify planned organisational change within the local government sector by applying a tangible organisational change model to develop a change narrative to describe factors that influenced local governments to address public health. Semi-structured interviews of 83 local government officers over the 10 years since implementation were used to create the narrative and identify factors that strengthened or hindered policy development and implementation at the local organisational level.
   Results: Participant interviews highlighted that the Policy Award Scheme contributed to steps outlined in the Pettigrew et al. (1992) stepped model of organisational change theory to support policy development.
   Implications for public health: Few studies have explored these elements in their own right. We argue that advocacy for structured policy development is continually needed to support and promote internal policy prioritisation and implementation in practice.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DE Resilience; Disaster; Recovery; Networks; Governance; Japan
AB When disaster strikes, urban planners often rely on feedback and guidance from committees of officials, residents, and interest groups when crafting reconstruction policy. Focusing on recovery planning committees after Japan's 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disasters, we compile and analyze a dataset on committee membership patterns across 39 committees with 657 members. Using descriptive statistics and social network analysis, we examine 1) how community representation through membership varied among committees, and 2) in what ways did committees share members, interlinking members from certain interests groups. This study finds that community representation varies considerably among committees, negatively related to the prevalence of experts, bureaucrats, and business interests. Committee membership overlap occurred heavily along geographic boundaries, bridged by engineers and government officials. Engineers and government bureaucrats also tend to be connected to more members of the committee network than community representatives, giving them prized positions to disseminate ideas about best practices in recovery. This study underscores the importance of diversity and community representation in disaster recovery planning to facilitate equal participation, information access, and policy implementation across communities.

AB Much of the scientific research in the United States is conducted in the public interest and funded through tax dollars, with exact funding allocations controlled through a variety of high-level processes, including through legislation. Scientists can provide expert opinions to government officials and their staff in this and other processes of establishing and enforcing governmental legislation, policies, and regulations, although such expertise is often underutilized. This is partly due to the paucity of scientists who have training to engage policymakers. To address this deficit, many scientific societies now provide organized training in science policy, including how to seek out opportunities to engage with policymakers. One such example is the Entomological Society of America's Science Policy Fellowship (ESA SPF) program. This article is written by ESA SPF members and discusses the importance of interfacing with policymakers, some challenges this group encountered, and lessons learned through our experiences in the program. Through efforts like this, we hope to inspire other scientists to engage their societies in advocacy work and make their voice heard.

ID EXPERIENCES
AB Obesity has become a global public health issue with increasing prevalence rates reaching pandemic proportions. Opportunities exist for nursing involvement in policy issues including but not limited to safe staffing patterns, safe handling of bariatric patients, national standards for food and beverages sold in schools, and insurance policies for obesity. Nurses are well suited to apply their expertise and influence in the policy process.
   The policy process is a dynamic, nonlinear process that includes agenda setting, legislation, regulation, implementation, and ongoing evaluation involving formal and informal relationships with special interest groups, individuals, legislators, bureaucrats, and/or political parties. A clear understanding of the entire policy process is imperative to successful participation in the policy arena.
   Nurses have a professional obligation to advocate for clients through participation in the policy process. Participation in the policy process influences the direction of policy and legislation, ultimately shaping the type of services and the environment in which clients may access services provided by nurses and other healthcare professionals.
   The purpose of this article is to provide an overview and framework for the policy process and to elucidate steps for applying the policy process to bariatric nursing issues. An overview of the obesity pandemic is discussed, and the policy process is differentiated from the legislative process with application to bariatric nursing issues.

AB This article charts the campaign for political recognition of dyslexia in Britain, focusing on the period from 1962 when concerted interest in the topic began. Through the Word Blind Centre for Dyslexic Children (1963-72), and the organisations that followed, it shows how dyslexia gradually came to be institutionalised, often in the face of government intransigence. The article shows how this process is best conceived as a complex interplay of groups, including advocates, researchers, civil servants and politicians of varying political stripes. Necessarily, the campaign was mediated through broader political, economic and social changes, including the increasing requirement for literacy in the productive worker, but it is not reducible to these factors. In this way, the article reflects on the conceptualisation of power and agency in accounts of the history of dyslexia to date and its broader relevance to the history of learning difficulties and disabilities.

AB As markets evolve, new regulatory concerns emerge. In response, policy makers institute new requirements for private businesses. Because they impose costs and generate uncertainty, these requirements may deter firm investment. To reduce regulatory uncertainty and favor investment, a principal can choose a rule-based regulatory framework. However, unlike discretion, rules do not adapt to circumstances and are thus inefficient. Using a micro-founded model, we uncover circumstances under which the ex ante certainty provided by a rule dominates the ex post efficiency provided by delegation to an unbiased agent. We also establish when delegating to a biased agent is optimal for a policy maker. Our main results highlight that the anticipated economic responses of firms can indirectly influence the organization of the bureaucracy. As such, any attempt to evaluate firms' direct influence in the rule-making processthrough lobbying or information disclosureneeds to establish the proper counterfactual that accounts for the indirect effects this article identifies.

AB This article draws lessons about environmental justice from a case study in the Jordan River Valley of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Building on notions of justice as recognition, the article argues that inclusive environmental justice agendas require the recognition of multiply marginalized groups and the fundamentally different understandings of environmental hazards and benefits they may have, and it proposes the use of intersectional analysis to do so. The village of al-Auja faces severe water-related challenges: a closed Israeli military zone blocking access to the Jordan River, which has also shrunk and grown polluted in recent decades; water wells with declining capacity and increasing salinity and a lack of permits to rehabilitate them; and the drying of a once-perennial spring. Residents, local government officials, and Palestinian staff members of a transborder nongovernmental organization agreed in identifying Israeli occupation as a key cause of water stress and articulated justice-based protests. However, while some emphasized the lack of Palestinian sovereignty over natural resources, others concentrated on the obstruction of villagers' agricultural livelihoods and household hardships. The article demonstrates that different life experiences, particularly along lines of rural/urban residence, career, and gender, shaped divergent definitions among Palestinians of environmental benefits and harms, and thus different priorities for environmental justice work. It suggests that attending to complex, intersecting lines of social experience in the early stage of environmental campaigns, when defining problems and forming goals for improvement, can lead to more representative reparation plans, institution building, and activist agendas.

AB Kentucky youth (14.3%) smoke more cigarettes as compared to the U.S. average (8.8%), and Appalachian communities suffer disproportionately from tobacco-related diseases such as lung cancer. Training youth to become advocates is an effective strategy to improve health equity. This article describes the development and impact of a youth advocacy program to promote tobacco control policies in Appalachian Kentucky. Phase I (2017-2018): two 1/2-day trainings followed by monthly meetings with one high school (n = 20 youth). Trainings provided information on tobacco use, consequences, industry tactics, evidence-based tobacco control, and advocacy skills. Results provided support for expansion to Phase II (2018-20119): A 1-day training followed by monthly information sharing implemented in three counties (N = 80). Youth were surveyed before and 6-months posttraining during both phases. Phase I: At posttraining, 85% of youth believed they could reduce the amount of tobacco use in their community versus 66% at baseline. More students tried at least once to convince school or government officials to be more concerned about tobacco use (77% vs. 47%). Phase II: More students supported tobacco policies at posttraining survey and realized policies are an effective strategy to reduce tobacco use. At posttraining survey, students reported greater interpersonal confidence talking with others about tobacco-related issues, with a 24% increase in confidence talking with adults in their communities, as well as greater advocacy self-efficacy. Youth in Appalachia demonstrate desire to influence tobacco use and policy to improve health equity. Findings reinforce the need for collaborative public health interventions to promote ongoing training and support for youth living in high-risk communities.

AB By introducing the concept of "structural advocacy organizations," this study theorizes and tests the boundary conditions within which organizations designed to protect the rights of disenfranchised groups promote structural changes at the intersection of gender and race. We test these claims on Brazil's "women's police stations," a type of structural advocacy organization with greater female representation on staff and with specialized procedures and an institutional mandate to address violence against women. The analysis indicates that homicides are lower among the population of women in municipalities which have women's police stations. However, within this group, homicides committed against women who self-identify as "black" and "brown" are lower only in municipalities that are characterized by high levels of female education and in metropolitan areas with infrastructure development. The results suggest that improving intersectional outcomes for women who are disenfranchised on race requires complementary policies and institutional mandates to address racialized violence.

AB Existing literature have decried the propensity to blame victims of rape which ultimately translates worryingly into a tolerance of crimes against persons. Being a lopsided and an understudied phenomenon, the present study sets out to explore the role of defensive pessimism and love, and sex perception on rape victim blaming among civil servants in Akwa Ibom State Civil Service Commission, Nigeria. Using a cross-sectional survey research design, 167 civil servants were recruited, comprising 84 males and 83 females, with mean age of 36.29 and standard deviation of 8.53. To measure variables of interest, three instruments: Perception of Love and Sex Scale, Attitudes Towards Rape Victims Scale, and the revised Defensive Pessimism Questionnaire were adopted. To analyze the information obtained from the measuring instruments, descriptive and regression statistics were employed, and results indicated that the less defensive pessimism civil servants reported, the more victim blame they exhibited. Findings also revealed that civil servants who perceived love and sex negatively reported more victim blame. From this study, a new link was formed between variables of interest and the need for adequate mass sensitization on the urgent need of condemning strongly acts of rape and sexual assaults, coupled with advocacy for desensitization on victim blame among "survivors" (rape victims).

ID CRISIS
AB This study explores the impact of democratization on financial reform in Korea and Taiwan. In Korea, democratization decreased the autonomy and efficiency of bureaucrats and increased the power of business groups, which led to unregulated financial liberalization. Crisis contributed to the urgency of reform, coalitional support, and burden sharing among people. After the crisis, the re-strengthened bureaucracy and weakened veto power of business and labor sectors resulted in "path-breaking" reform in Korea. In Taiwan, the historically conservative financial system remained stable, allowing Taiwan to escape the Asian crisis but later becoming obstacles to reform. Democratization decreased the autonomy of bureaucrats and increased money politics: Lack of consensus among parties, divided government, and opposition within vested interest groups led to "lagged and stalemated" financial reform in Taiwan.

AB This article examines the discretionary power of national governments in EU policy making, focusing on the preparatory stage of European legislation. We assess the conditions under which the ministry in charge of the pre-negotiations is able to withstand attempts of domestic stakeholders to change the national bargaining stance. Our case studies and multivariate regressions on 15 legislative proposals show that the overall conflict between domestic stakeholders and pressure from powerful interest groups make such changes more likely. Parliamentary actors and parties do, conversely, not possess much power in these often technical deliberations. Although governments and their bureaucracies have to yield in some situations, they possess ample discretion in the average decision-making process. We illustrate our findings with a comparative case study on the controversial attempt by the Commission to regulate the usage of PVC softeners in toys.

AB This study is an attempt to relate the effectiveness of the rulemaking process to political controls on the bureaucracies that create regulations. Such controls include requiring cost-benefit analysis, requiring review of regulations by a legislative committee, and requiring interest group participation in rule writing efforts. Scholars have both credited controls with allowing politicians to control future bureaucratic decision making and blamed controls for ossifying the regulatory process. This article considers eight case studies of state regulation of child care. These case studies cast doubt on the assertions that political controls play a prominent role in bureaucratic decision making. The rule-making decisions of bureaucrats in these case studies were influenced far more by executives and legislators in power and interest groups than by the presence or absence of procedural controls put in place by previous political officeholders.

ID POLICY-MAKING; STATES; PROFESSIONALS; BUREAUCRACIES
AB Missing from most studies of congressional staff is the insight gained from the representative bureaucracy literature that descriptive characteristics may affect the behavior of unelected bureaucrats. In considering congressional representation as an activity mediated by staff, we ask: Does descriptive representation of congressional committee staff lead to substantive representation? We explore this question, using gender as our descriptive characteristic of interest. We produce a typology of staff roles developed through in-depth interviews about two cases that illustrate how institutional factors affect and constrain women staffers, contributions as substantive representatives for issues concerning women. We posit that passive representation translates into the active representation only when: 1) interest groups hold expectations for passive representation on an issue and then in turn demand some level of active representation; 2) a staff member possesses the necessary resources of interest, expertise, and status, and 3) the opportunity structure of member-staff relations, staff autonomy, and political salience coincide. When these conditions are less than optimal, active representation will not occur.

SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Once the poster child for government-sponsored overfishing, New England by 2005 had become a fishery conservation success story. This article develops and deploys a problem-definition framework to explain the dramatic shift from a permissive to a protective fishery management regime in New England. I argue that neither new and improved scientific information nor pressure from powerful commercial interests caused government officials to modify their approach to fishery management. Instead, environmentalists used lawsuits to threaten fishery managers' autonomy and thereby forced them to replace fishers' risk-tolerant definition of the problem with environmentalists' more precautionary one as the basis for management. Environmentalists had legal leverage because they were able to demonstrate convincingly a substantial discrepancy between what the agency's governing statute required and what managers actually did. Two factors were critical to environmentalists' success: a compelling and credible scientific story about the relationship between fishing and the health of fish stocks, and an explicit conservation requirement in the language governing fishery management.

AB Using a qualitative research approach, this study provides an inquiry into the nature of democracy and digital political activism discourses on @Hopewell Chin'ono and @Jacob Ngarivhume prior to the 31(st) July demonstrations. Alternative communications spaces have revolutionised political communication in Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe, political polarisation has created a monolithic voice in the mainstream media. In the "Second Republic", digital activism is a growing phenomenon where subalterns question the state. This study is guided by Manuel Castells' Power and Counter Power Theory. Data gathered using netnography was analysed using critical discourse analysis. Findings show that digital activism has turned into social media "dissidence", calling for the resignation of the government officials including the Executive through 31(st) demonstrations. There is an intimate relationship between digital democracy and digital activism, enabling political advocacy and lobbying. Twitter is used to safeguard the lives of activists. Religious discourses were used by both Jacob Ngarivhume and Hopewell Chin'ono as they drummed up support for the July 31(st) demonstrations.

ID POLICY
AB Basic income advocates propose a model that they believe will dramatically improve on current welfare programmes by alleviating poverty, reducing involuntary unemployment and social exclusion, redistributing care work, achieving a better work-life balance, and so on. Whether these expected social effects materialise in practice critically depends on how the model is implemented, but on this topic the basic income debate remains largely silent. Few advocates explicitly consider questions of implementation, and those that do are typically dismissive of the administrative challenges of implementing a basic income and critical (even overtly hostile) towards bureaucracy. In this contribution we briefly examine (and rebut) several reasons that have led basic income advocates to ignore administration. The main peril of such neglect, we argue, is that it misleads basic income advocates into a form of Panglossian optimism that risks causing basic income advocacy to become self-defeating.

AB BACKGROUND
   In July 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) approved an application submitted by Mount Sinai physicians, Dr Craig Katz, Dr Anna Rosen, and Dr Hiwot Woldu, and medical student Jasleen Salwan to add risperidone to the Essential Medicines List. Initiated in 1977 and updated every 2 years based on applications for revisions submitted by parties outside WHO, the list guides drug policy in developing nations around the world. Although it is not binding, it helps government officials as well as external donors set funding priorities.
   WHO's approval of the Mount Sinai team's application marked the first addition of an atypical antipsychotic to the list, addressing a major neglected area of global health. It is hoped that it will be followed by many more victories for underserved psychiatric patients across the globe. (C) 2014 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

It follows the occurrence of the phenomenon in relation to misuse of power for personal profit and provides an overview of theses formulated by political science authors on corruption and misuse of power (e.g. Rose-Ackerman, Warren, Johnston, Klitgaard) in relation to public administration and policy making. Examples and documentation of Slovak experience is provided, particularly in the field of politico-administrative relations and from the exercise of discretionary power of the street level bureaucracy. Corrupted behaviour usually arises in the environment of public power misuse, where institutional and legal framework does not provide sufficient opportunity for the expression of plurality of opinions which consequently is reflected in the unequal participatory access of various economic and political elites as well as interest groups.

AB Purpose: Social service programmes that offer consumer choices are intended to guide service efficiency and customer satisfaction. However, little is known about how social service consumers actually make choices and how providers deliver such services. This article details the practical implementation of consumer choice in a Canadian workers' compensation vocational retraining programme. Method: Discourse analysis was conducted of in-depth interviews and focus groups with 71 injured workers and service providers, who discussed their direct experience of a vocational retraining system. Data also included procedural, policy and administrative documents. Results: Consumer choice included workers being offered choices about some service aspects, but not being able to exercise meaningful discretion. Programme cost objectives and restrictive rules and bureaucracy skewed the guidance provided to workers by service providers. If workers did not make the "right" choices, then the service providers were required to make choices for them. This upset workers and created tension for service providers. Conclusions: The ideal of consumer choice in a social service programme was difficult to enact, both for workers and service providers. Processes to increase quality of guidance to social service consumers and to create a systematic feedback look between system designers and consumers are recommended.

AB Rulemaking is a critical part of American government and governance. This article reviews the political underpinnings of modern rulemaking. Specifically, it highlights the process and impact of agency regulations, as well as the key tools used by the legislature, elected executive, and courts to oversee the rulemaking process. The article also reviews who participates in the rulemaking process, as well as who influences regulatory content. Finally, new directions in regulatory policymaking are explored, including data collection advancements, as well as the potential role for guidance documents as replacements for more traditionally issued notice and comment regulations.

AB The lens of administration burden is used to examine the behavior of nonprofit organizations when managing regulations attached to public funding and public policy implementation. Interviews with leaders of nonprofit domestic violence advocacy organizations dependent on public funding streams were qualitatively content analyzed to answer three questions. How do nonprofit managers respond to burdensome bureaucratic reporting measures when they are at odds? How do they determine when to comply and when compliance is not possible? What is the outcome for service recipients? The authors find that these nonprofit organizations simultaneously implement multiple public policies while absorbing the accountability costs. They do this to shield their clients from the laborious task of obtaining a spectrum of services across public systems.

AB Voluntary sector and non-profit studies require theoretical frameworks facilitating better understandings of what occurs on the ground. Following Lipsky's (Street-level bureaucracy: dilemmas of the individual in public service, Russell Sage Foundation, New York, 1980) formulation of street-level bureaucracies, scholars have emphasized workplace hierarchies, reproducing dichotomous 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' conceptualizations of practice which can obscure the full complexity of practitioners' workplace relationships. In this paper, we offer a thematic model of (collective) action that centres the 'division of labour' across, and relations between, professional niches that are differentiated by their 'helping' orientations, workplace tasks, and responsibilities to service users rather than their organizational status or salaries. We mobilize qualitative research undertaken in the penal voluntary sectors of Canada and England to highlight the mutually constitutive efforts of frontline and management work with criminalized service users. Drawing on and extending Alinsky's 'river dilemma', we conceptualize practice in the (penal) voluntary sector as organized according to the differing choices practitioners make about whom to 'help' and how to intervene, which have consequences for social policy, service delivery, and advocacy work.

SO NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW

DT Article
ID PUBLIC FORUM; AMENDMENT
AB In this Note, Sheri Danz evaluates the impact of the evolution of the public forum doctrine on advocates' claims of access to welfare centers. Welfare agencies often prohibit legal advocates from associating with and educating welfare applicants on welfare center grounds Recently, courts have applied the public forum doctrine to uphold welfare agency restrictions on advocacy against First Amendment challenges by advocates. Danz argues that despite the increasingly formalistic and deferential nature of the Supreme Court's public forum decisions, reviewing courts should not uphold welfare agency policies that prohibit advocacy in welfare center waiting rooms. She first examines the use of bureaucratic disentitlement practices by welfare agencies to deny applicants their statutory rights and deprive them of much-needed benefits. Danz argues that these practices invoke a core concern of the First Amendment-to protect the right of citizens to check governmental abuse. Next, she explores changes in the public forum doctrine and assesses their impact on advocates' claims of access to welfare center waiting rooms. Finally, Danz identifies three grounds under the modern public forum doctrine that should lead a reviewing court to overturn prohibitions on advocacy at welfare centers: Restrictions on advocacy in welfare center waiting rooms lack the compelling interest required for restrictions in designated public fora, many prohibitions on advocacy reflect viewpoint-discriminatory motives, and courts that view restrictions as a component of bureaucratic disentitlement may find that restrictions on advocacy fail reasonably to promote legitimate governmental goals.

ID WELFARE-STATE
AB This analysis of Korean pension politics under the Roh Moo-hyun administration focuses on the roles and limitations of party politics and social dialogue as institutional intermediaries between the state and civil society. It suggests that the social policy reform was made through formal democratic systems but without some of the essential elements of democracy. Although each political party admitted pension problems suggested by civil society during the initial stage of agenda formation, the final decision was made through negotiations among the political parties and government bureaucracy. In making decisions, there was no room to discuss the positions of labor, capital or other social groups. The political parties did not provide a channel for civil society's positions to be reflected in National Assembly discussions. On the other hand, an attempt at social dialogue was initiated by the new ruling elite. Although various interest groups displayed the possibility of agreement, the process of social dialogue was stopped by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Even after democratization, bureaucracy affected party politics and dominated social dialogue as Korean pension politics lacked institutional communication between the state and civil society.

AB Frameworks that examine policy subsystems, networks, and coalitions view bureaucracies as part of the mix of policy actors that advocate policy positions in both domestic and international arenas. However, few examine bureaucracies as independent actors and how they exercise influence distinct from other pressure groups. The ways in which domestic bureaucracies engage in the international environment is woefully under examined, with only a few studies examining how domestic bureaucrats affect decision making in the international arena. However, it is not unreasonable to posit that bureaucratic engagement in the international arena may have political implications in the domestic sphere. Building on examinations of bureaucratic autonomy, this research queries the ways in which domestic bureaucracies can interact in the international arena to "change agendas and preferences" of domestic political actors. While it finds that attention to developing an international reputation can enhance political leverage at home, it may do so at a cost to domestic programs if insufficient attention is given to domestic aspects of the organization's mission. Nevertheless, as attention lurches from one arena to another, policy change is facilitated by the politically powerful resources of an international reputation in expertise, active engagement in the international policy community, and broadly based support for programmatic change.

AB A rich theoretical literature has illuminated the institutional mechanisms through which legislators influence agency policy. We focus on the behavioral ones, examining the decisions of individual legislators to intervene in agency rulemaking. We argue that interest groups play an important but incompletely understood role in the oversight process. They may sound alarms when agencies threaten harm, but they also subsidize the interventions of sympathetic overseers postalarm. We test the theory's hypotheses with data from face-to-face surveys of lobbyists involved in an EPA rulemaking to revise air quality standards. We find that public and private interest groups successfully employ this strategy but that the latter have the advantage, an advantage that does not flow from their substantial contributions to congressional campaigns.

AB The essential priority of protecting children who attend schools that are vulnerable to collapse during an earthquake is irrefutable. The structural integrity of public schools in Lebanon is a source of deep concern due to their outdated design, deteriorated status and apparent lack of compliance with seismic design regulations. The purpose of this article is to advocate the seismic retrofitting of school buildings and to demonstrate the financial gain of such retrofitting procedures when compared with the cost of repair or replacement. In this paper, the authors offer practical information supported by numerical data, regarding the urgent priority of retrofitting school buildings and enhancing their functional capacity to withstand future destructive earthquakes. The aim is to alert school administrators, public leaders, government officials and international agencies regarding the seismic vulnerability of public school buildings and their subsequent effects on the safety of children in Lebanon. In addition, the authors demonstrate the economic advantages of seismic retrofitting in protecting children and their schools and calls for government intervention to assess and retrofit public school buildings to reduce their vulnerability to collapse during future earthquakes.

AB In the 1970s policy making in the Netherlands took place in sectoral networks, consisting of professional interest groups and like minded civil servants, advisory councils, mp's and departmental ministers. In this article the author examines whether such a sectoral policy network still exists in Dutch health care by comparing past and present data on the background of civil servants, mp's and departmental ministers. Next she describes the political fight against the health care sectoral network, which has gone on for decades. She concludes that the health care sectoral network has been severely weakened, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a substantial reduction of health care costs, which was one of the main reasons why politicians fought against sectoral interests in the first place.

AB This paper examines the origins of the institutional organization and advocacy strategies that later culminated in American public broadcasting. Previous to the Communications Act of 1934, which privatized American broadcasting, educational radio lacked standards for best practices and functioned in a decentralized and localized form. After the Act, the Office of Education (OOE) took interest in radio as a medium to expand federal initiatives related to educational "public forums," town-hall style meetings centered around community debate. Noting the lack of noncommercial channels in which to broadcast forums to a larger audience, the OOE began to collaborate with the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) to lobby the FCC, while producing civic programming with commercial broadcasters. Instead of fighting the regulation, the OOE and NAEB founded an advocacy approach centered on creating an alternate broadcasting infrastructure as a way to address regulatory precedents. In this process, early forms of production, distribution, and infrastructure later associated with public broadcasting were devised out of a hybrid of commercial broadcasting aesthetics and federal educational bureaucracy. Contrary to the received view, discussion of the origins of American public broadcasting must be framed as advocacy to change the national system through strategies of research, collaboration, and governmental incorporation instead of resistance.

AB Competition to advance issues on public policy agendas is constant. Political scientists agree that professional "policy entrepreneurs" (researchers, academics, and bureaucrats) serve as conduits in this process. Grassroots advocacy has always been part of the political landscape as non-professional people also take on the role of policy advocates or activists, to get specific problems and preferred solutions onto public and policy agendas and motivate policyrnakers to take action. The contribution of grassroots advocacy to significant policy changes is often under-funded because its impacts are hard to isolate and quantify, and are often most evident in retrospect. This paper examines the contribution of the Global Campaign for Microbicides to the movement to expand the range of HIV prevention options for women and describes how it mobilized hundreds of grassroots policy activists around the world to take coordinated action on this issue. It reviews the Campaign's accomplishments and highlights some of its strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the paper considers the value of similar efforts on the part of grassroots advocates seeking to influence the post-ICPD and post-2015 development agendas as they are being negotiated. Decisions regarding what kind of advocacy work is carried out during this process, and by whom and how, will inevitably shape the content of these new frameworks. (C) 2013 Reproductive Health Matters

AB Scholars focus on interstate competition and intrastate economic conditions as the primary determinants of state economic development policies, including direct subsidies. New data from the Good Jobs First Subsidy Tracker illustrates large differences in subsidy spending across the states and that established firms are the disproportionate beneficiaries. In light of this new evidence, we argue that the political presence of the business sector within the state is an important determinant of state subsidy spending. A large political presence helps forward industry interests before government and has the potential to capture state governments. We find support for the cultural capture model by demonstrating that a greater number of lobbyists and campaign contributions from businesses leads to more subsidy spending, all else equal. We conclude that subsidies, and which companies receive them, are a product of both politics and economics.

ID RESEARCH KNOWLEDGE; EXCHANGE; SCIENCE; MODEL
AB Methods: This article reviews evidence-based medicine and models of research use in policy. Then it reports the results of interviews with civil servants in the Ontario Ministry of Health, which recently adopted a stewardship rather than an operational role, incorporating many evidence-oriented strategies. The interviews focused on functional roles for research-based evidence in policy advice.
   Findings: The clinical context and tools for evidence-based medicine can rarely be generalized to policy. Most current models of research use offer lessons to researchers wishing to apply their work to policy but little help for civil servants wishing to become more evidence oriented. The interviews revealed functional roles for research in setting agendas (noting upcoming issues and screening interest groups' claims), developing new policies (reducing uncertainty, helping speak truth to power, and preventing repetition and duplication), and monitoring or modifying existing policies (continuously improving programs and creating a culture of inquiry). Each area requires different tools to help filter the push of evidence from researchers and set agendas, to facilitate the urgent pull on relevant research by civil servants developing new policy, and to support ongoing linkage and exchange between civil servants and researchers for monitoring and modifying existing policy.
   Conclusions: A functional framework for evidence-informed policy advice is useful for distinguishing the activity from evidence-based medicine and "auditing" the balance of efforts across the different functional roles of research in policy.

AB In 2009, following several countries including Burundi and Nigeria, a proposal was introduced in Rwanda to criminalize same-sex sex and lgbt activism. However, unlike the other countries, Rwanda's Article 217 criminalization proposal was eliminated within months of its introduction. While this result can be understood as a success story, it also can elide the obstacles Rwandan activists experience when organizing for lgbt people. The cross-movement coalition that formed to oppose Article 217 specifically adopted a nonconfrontational strategy designed to work within the authoritarian political system in Rwanda. While activists framed the removal of Article 217 as aligned with existing government priorities, the dialogue strategy has clear limits when activists' goals are to make further changes in Rwanda, particularly when government officials do not see further changes as aligned with their priorities. A combination of the authoritarian system and the government's focus on economic development and individual advancement narrowly circumscribe what types of activism the government will accept. This imperative to conform to government expectations means activists adopt rhetoric and encourage lgbt people to engage in activities that are focused on how they appear as individuals. This focus on the individual elides the wider structural problems that exist in Rwanda that perpetuate discrimination againstlgbt people, particularly those who experience multiple marginalizations. Lgbt activism is circumscribed so it can occur in Rwanda, but this has consequences for how much change is advocated for and who benefits from this activism.

AB It is widely accepted that better-connected firms exercise more political influence. However, because both social ties and political influence are difficult to observe, it remains little understood how different types of ties affect different types of political action. We develop new theory that contrasts the effects of ties to other firms in the same industry (peer ties) with ties to elected officials and bureaucrats (government ties). We argue that peer ties are useful for facilitating collective action, which is most often used to seek influence over broad policy issues that affect many firms. In contrast, while government ties are more versatile, these should primarily also allow firms to pursue narrow, particularistic issues that benefit only one or a small number of firms. Using a new survey of foreign-owned firms operating in the Philippines, we demonstrate that peer ties play an important role in firms' efforts to influence policy at the national level, where issues are more likely to affect large numbers of firms. Government ties are also valuable, though primarily at the local level, where issues are more likely to affect a smaller number of firms.

SO HOME CULTURES
LA English
DT Article
DE postwar modernism; state bureaucracy; mediation; civil society actors
AB To solve the ongoing problem of housing shortages following the Second World War, European countries opted for high volumes of inexpensive modernist building boxes. The efforts to modernize the building industry resulted in a form of modernist domestic architecture, often as an overly technocratic. enterprise and a mere shadow of Europe's prewar modernist ambitions. Taking the Dutch case as its point of departure, this article disputes the prevailing view of housing production as purely state-driven, technocratic in character, and oriented towards economies of scale. Although public housing bureaucracies turned, Planning standardization, and normalization into the key features of. the reconstruction era, the perspective changes if one considers the countervailing role of mediators such as architects and other civil actors. While unraveling how initial support for the government's push for industrial housing turned into the coordinated opposition of professional spokespersons and interest groups, this article highlights the way in which civil agents dealt with the housing bureaucracy and succeeded in improving housing standards and building requirements. In contrast with the standard view in Dutch historiography, this article describes how civil society protagonists employed coordinated action with mutual consultation and compromise. Women's organizations and architects adjusted to this manner of governance and policy making, preventing the state from monopolizing and leveling mass housing, like in the Soviet Union. The multiple initiatives of Willem van Tijen and his colleagues are presented as examples of the postwar dedication to the issue of public housing.

AB Pesticides overuse is a serious threat to ecosystems and wildlife, human health, and agricultural sustainability. So far, however, social scientists have not produced systematic evidence on the political-economic determinants of pesticides overuse. We argue that the agrochemical industry, as a profit-motivated interest group, will only mobilize politically to avoid reductions in pesticides use when regulatory institutions are potentially capable of correcting a market failure. If regulatory institutions are weakened by corruption or other factors, pesticides overuse occurs with or without the influence of the agrochemical industry. We test this interactive theory systematically against quantitative data on pesticides use in 24 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, 1991-2003. Using corruption and other indicators to capture bureaucratic quality, we find substantively large and statistically robust interactive effects. The agrochemical industry is a crucial determinant of pesticides use in nations with low corruption, whereas the agrochemical industry has no effect on pesticides use under corrupt regulatory institutions. Troublingly, these results imply that reduced corruption may not improve actual regulatory effectiveness unless political institutions can somehow constrain the influence of special interests.

DT Article
DE Bureaucracy models; Property tax limit override; Regression
   discontinuity design; Fiscal effects
AB Despite abundant evidence regarding the influence of US state-imposed tax and expenditure limitations on local governments, the causes and consequences of local overrides remain largely unexplored. This article comprehensively examines the fiscal effects of local overrides of Massachusetts's state-enforced property tax limit. Existing evidence has shown that pressure from powerful local interest groups, such as public schoolteachers and public employees, is crucial for determining agenda-setting and the successes or failures of measures overriding the statewide property tax limit. In that sense, fiscal constraints are able to curb bureaucrats' budget-maximizing behaviors. Empirically, a regression discontinuity design estimation shows that local property tax limit overrides increase local property taxes and total revenues, decentralize the state-local fiscal relationship, and improve local budgetary balance. However, overrides do not affect local government spending.

AB In its attempt to prove that voters, politicians, and bureaucrats are motivated by the public interest, Self-Interest and Public Interest in Western Politics overlooks a great deal of public-choice research, to which much has been added during the two decades since it was published. The importance of self-interest at both the micro and macro levels of politics becomes clear once one looks not simply at the "inputs" of a democracy but at its "outputs" as well. The prevalence of interest groups, the dysfunction of the United States tax code, the lobbying by unions for their members' self-interest, the earmarks in the Patriot Act, the numerous cases of corruption in Western democracies, and the dissatisfaction of citizens with their governments' failings all point to the importance of self-interest in politics.

AB Objective: This research explored the pathways through which the experiential knowledge of people who need and use mental health and social housing services (citizen-users) gains access to policymaking. Methods: Qualitative instrumental case study methodology focused the study on the policy field of mental health and social housing in Manitoba, Canada. Data collection included interviews with 21 key informants from four policy actor groups: citizen-users, service providers, advocacy organization representatives, and government officials. Relevant policy. related documents were also reviewed. Data were analyzed using inductive qualitative methods. Results: Key informants described diverse pathways through which the experiential knowledge of citizen-users has been communicated to policy decision makers. Pathways have involved direct discourse between citizen-users and decision makers. Alternatively, indirect pathways were ones in which experiential knowledge was translated by other policy actors. Informants identified factors that could influence the integrity of the indirect pathways: the length and complexity of the pathways, the motivations and interests of the translators, and strategies to enhance the pathways. The pathways could be strengthened by developing the culture, leadership, knowledge, skills and attitudes supportive of engaging citizen-users and by accurately translating their experiential knowledge. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: If citizen-users are to be included in policymaking in a recovery-oriented mental health system, action must be taken to enhance the pathways through which their experiential knowledge reaches policymaking processes. Service providers, advocacy organization representatives and government officials can all take action to promote social policymaking that is informed by citizen-users' ideas and experiences.

ID EDUCATIONAL-POLICY
AB Background/Context: Researchers have found that school districts with greater representation of Latinos and African Americans on their school boards tend to also have higher percentages of Latino and African American administrators and teachers. This increased presence of coethnics in the educational bureaucracy was then found to predict more favorable educational outcomes for these students.
   Purpose: We determine if these relationships hold for Latinos in California, which has the largest Latino population in the United States and where Latino students make up just under half of all students enrolled in public schools.
   Research Design: Using an original data set of all California school districts in the 2004-2005 school year, we tested these relationships for Latinos in California using multiple regression.
   Conclusion: Contrary to previous research, we found that Latino representation on California school boards was not greater in systems of single-member district election. We did, however, find that the greater presence of Latinos on school boards did increase the likelihood that Latinos would be hired as administrators, but only in Latino-majority districts. After appropriate controls, districts with more Latino administrators also tended to have more Latino teachers. Last, and again contrary to previous research, we found no systematic impact of having more Latino teachers and administrators on enhancing student outcomes for either all Latino students or for English language learners.

AB Voters reward or punish politicians by deeming them responsible for positive and negative outcomes, but how, in turn, do politicians attribute responsibility to those who actually deliver public services? Inattention to this question renders incomplete current perspectives on democratic processes of accountability, even as politicians are increasingly provided with performance data to hold bureaucrats accountable. We shed light on this issue using a survey experiment of elected officials featuring actual performance data. We find that the provision of performance data makes elected officials more willing to attribute causal responsibility to bureaucratic leaders, but only in cases of low performance, suggesting a negativity bias in public sector responsibility attribution processes. Additionally, we offer evidence that interest group advocates influence how elected officials use performance information to attribute responsibility, but contingent on ideological alignment.

AB Government agencies service interest groups, advocate policies, provide advice to elected officials, and create and implement public policy. Scholars have advanced theories to explain the role of agencies in American politics, but efforts to test these theories are hampered by the inability to systematically measure agency preferences. We present a method for measuring agency ideology that yields ideal point estimates of individual bureaucrats and agencies that are directly comparable with those of other political actors. These estimates produce insights into the nature of the bureaucratic state and provide traction on a host of questions about American politics. We discuss what these estimates reveal about the political environment of bureaucracy and their potential for testing theories of political institutions. We demonstrate their utility by testing key propositions from Gailmard and Patty's (2007) influential model of political control and endogenous expertise development.

AB The literature offers individually valid yet collectively inconsistent hypotheses concerning the nature of public agencies' responsiveness to interest groups. This article analyzes the nature of this responsiveness by examining the brokerage potential of public agencies among interest groups. Such a brokerage potential is hypothesized to follow from agencies' preferences for policy goods as well as the tendency of interest groups to seek access to public agencies. It combines analyses of agencies' demand for policy goods with interest groups preferences for seeking access to specific policy venues. The analyses are based on survey data of national civil servants and interest groups in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands. The findings suggest that both strategic preferences as well as organizational routines positively correlate with a brokerage potential while interaction patterns within and with the organizational environment of public agencies can constrain their brokerage potential in several distinct ways.

AB Across the world acute hospitals are under unprecedented pressures due to shrinking budgets and increasing demand, against this backdrop they are also experiencing record levels of activity in Accident & Emergency and delayed transfers of care. Reducing pressure on hospitals by avoiding unnecessary admissions and delayed discharges has risen up the global policy agenda. However, reviews of strategies and policies have rarely involved discussions about the role that hospital social workers play in achieving timely hospital discharge. Yet discharge planning has become a, if not the, central function of these professionals. This paper presents the results of a small-scale exploratory study of hospital social work in an acute hospital in Northern Ireland. The findings reveal that the work of hospital social workers is characterised by increased bureaucracy, an emphasis on targets and a decrease in the time afforded to forming relationships with older people. Hospital social workers highlight concerns that the emphasis on discharge planning and pressures associated with the austerity agenda limits their capacity to provide other more traditional roles such as advocacy and counselling. It is argued that hospital social work should not be narrowly defined as 'simply' co-ordinating discharge plans. The tension that arises between expediting hospital discharge and advocating for older people and their families is also discussed.

AB This research explores the implications of nonprofit leaders' government ties for nonprofit operations and functions. Based on 81 survey questionnaires completed by civic environmental NGOs (eNGOs) in China and interviews with executives from 33 eNGOs, the authors examine the personal backgrounds of eNGO leaders and find that most Chinese civic eNGOs are connected with the government in one or more of three ways: political ties, service organization ties, or personal ties. Personal ties, or good guanxi with government officials, are positively associated with a higher level of funding stability and a more developed management system. Environmental NGOs with leaders who are current government officials or legislative body members are more likely to be engaged in policy advocacy. Service organization ties facilitate eNGOs' efforts to be engaged in legal services and to scale up to work on environmental issues at the national level. Moreover, an eNGO's policy advocacy engagement is associated with its ties with the nonprofit community.

ID GOVERNANCE NETWORKS
AB This paper focuses on how risk management practices and decision making in a government agency are affected when a high-ranking policy network is activated during the planning process of a major road construction project. The policy network studied in this paper comprised Volvo, Ericsson, SAAB, the Gothenburg Municipal Executive Committee Chairman and the Swedish Transport Administration Director General, among others. The network worked to incorporate an experimental fifth lane on the E45 roadway. The experimental lane was presented as an investment that would create business opportunities - companies from around the world could use the E45 to test new car models, safety devices and technical and environmental measures. During the months before the experimental road lane project was terminated by the National Road Administration, road officials at the street level prepared two design plans, one with the experimental road lane and the other without the lane. The principal assignment for the officials was to initiate and make decisions on the basis of risk analysis. The four risk themes considered during the planning process were localization, road solution, publicity and legality.
   The experimental road lane case study demonstrates that policy networks (i.e., lobbying groups) operating within a network governance structure can negatively affect risk assessment and risk management. The groups can override procedural and expert-based decision making rules when they have access to public decision making powers at the appropriate level. In such situations, public officials responsible for risk management at the street level risk losing control and decision making power. The empirical findings stress the importance of taking measures that guarantee risk management in situations where the individuals responsible for risk management (i.e., public bureaucrats) lose authority and discretion. Deep knowledge of statutory and ethical obligations can endow officials with an enhanced ability to make high-quality public risk decisions and, thereby, advance critical infrastructure protection efforts. The study presented in this paper was inspired by network governance, implementation and decision making theories; the empirical data was collected through passive participatory observations and from interviews and relevant documents.

AB This paper applies the property rights theory to study both positive and normative aspects of legislative delegation in a setup where interest groups directly influence lawmaking by initiating regulatory bargaining. A self-interested legislature choosing between the direct exercise of its legislative authority and delegation to an administrative agency must therefore trade off the value of bureaucratic competence against bureaucratic drift and, importantly, loss of control over bargaining. Our analysis, first, clarifies when the legislature's choice between delegation and no delegation is socially efficient or socially inefficient; second, highlights the role of political bargaining and shows that precluding interest group influence through bargaining may actually increase the scope for socially inefficient outcomes; and, third, illustrates the model's predictions in light of selected stylized facts and the practice of scant empirical work on legislative delegation.

AB The bureaucracy has a profound impact on the direction of policy when it determines eligibility for a variety of government programs. Given the significance of eligibility determination for policy and the fact that street-level bureaucrats have great latitude when interpreting eligibility standards, organized interests have an incentive to try to influence the application of eligibility rules. Despite this, few researchers have explored the impact of organized interests on eligibility determination. Using data from the Veterans' Disability Compensation (VDC) program, we examine how organized interests affect the implementation of eligibility-based programs. We emphasize the dual role of many organized interests as both traditional advocacy groups and service providers and use insight from the interest group and third-party service provider literature to formulate hypotheses. We find that veterans' groups affect variables capturing demand for, access to, and effective implementation of the VDC program, although we do not find effects for every measure of implementation included in our study.

AB Networks are increasingly found connected to and within bureaucracy in publicly regulated management systems. The constituent features are completely diametrical, however. The democratically legitimate authority, with hierarchical structures and defined social duties, encounters an open concept that is used by the various stakeholders as an infrastructure for communication and as a platform for their own interests. Therefore, a specific operational framework is required to utilize the potential positive dynamics of networks in the public sector. Cliques are more than an irritation; they are incompatible with democratically legitimate activities in the public sector.

AB This paper will examine how animal protection investigators, lobbyists and campaigners in Scotland consider the relationship between nature and ethics. Specifically, it will look at the complex ways in which activists deploy the categories natural' and unnatural' in order to interpret realms of animal suffering and judge the actions of human and non-human agents in those fields. The paper is also concerned with charting the ways in which animal protection activists develop strategies for persuading various audiences of the rightness of their position; these include not only charity supporters and prospective donors, but also politicians and civil servants involved in the legislative process in the Scottish Parliament. More broadly, the paper engages with debates in the emergent fields of the anthropology of ethics and human-animal relations. It is interested in the relationship between ethics and appearance and in the distribution of agency in claims or judgements of ethical or unethical behaviour.

AB "Functions of organization have been determined by dominating bureaucrats in power". Thus if this is also true for "change process" (Ortayli (2000: 1-2), in twentieth century, administrative apparatus had changed very slowly. This also suggests that in order to better understand administrative structures, one should study administrative history. In Anatolia, where Turkey has placed geographically since X-XII centuries, a traditional culture has been living, and regional characteristics have dominated besides a central government system. We can have a look at this old world to better understand this new world: It has been the place where 'writings had been used, bureaucracy and urbanization came into existence'. In terms of municipal governance, a traditional pattern would be traced as active local interaction partners. This paper tries to reflect on some traditional patterns to interpret today's municipalities of Turkey. It also refers modern urban interest groups and citizen participation.

AB This paper discusses health sector reforms and what they have meant for sexual and reproductive health advocacy in low-income countries. Beginning in the late 1980s, it outlines the main macro-economic shifts and policy trends which affect countries dependent on external aid and the main health sector reforms taking place. It then considers the implications of successive macro-economic and reform agendas for reproductive and sexual health advocacy. International debate today is focused on the conditions necessary for socio-economic development and the role of governments in these, and how to improve the performance of health sector bureaucracies and delivery systems. A critical challenge is how to re-negotiate the policy and financial space for sexual and reproductive health services within national health systems and at international level. Advocacy for sexual and reproductive health has to tread the line between a vision of reproductive health for all and action on priority conditions, which means articulating an informed view on needs and priorities. In pressing for greater funding for reproductive health, advocates need to find an appropriate balance between concern with health systems strengthening and service delivery and programmes, and create alliances with progressive health sector reformers.

TI Social Impact Bonds: An Innovative Way for Social Financing
SO PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL

AB Social welfare remains the most important objective of governments of all the countries despite the economic growth. Government spends huge funds in welfare schemes each year for the benefits of public at large. The welfare schemes include poverty alleviation, improvement in sanitation, educating girl child, employment creation, eliminating social evils, providing safe drinking water etc. Despite spending huge amount of money, government is unable to achieve the required objectives. There are many reasons for the same. Lack of accountability on part of government officials, Red tapism, and corruption, lobbying of government officials are some of the reasons poses hurdle in effective implementation and achieving desirable results out of public sector spending. Moreover the social objectives are not outcome based and they are just confined to accomplish a given task. Government officials lack incentives for effective implementation of such schemes.
   Due to the inherent weakness in the social system, social impact bonds came into play. The first SIB was launched in UK by Social Finance Ltd. in September 2010. Since then, government of many countries including US, Canada, India, Israel, Ireland is exploring use of social impact bonds. This paper attempts to explain the conceptual framework of social impact bonds and its adoption by various countries like UK, US, India and Israel in social welfare programs for the benefits of various social groups.

ID NETWORK AUTOCORRELATION; EUROPEAN-UNION; STRATEGIES; COALITIONS;
   STRENGTH; US
AB The degree to which interest groups gain access to policymakers has often been explained by focusing on the exchange of resources in a dyadic relation between interest groups and policymakers. This article argues that the position an interest group occupies within a coalition and the relations it has outside its coalition substantially affect the likelihood of gaining access to policymakers. Our empirical focus is on the Dutch interest group system for which we examine how coalitions among groups and the network position of interest groups within and between such coalitions shape access. The analysis, based on data collected among 107 Dutch interest groups and 28 policymakers, leads to the conclusion that network positions count differently for elected and non-elected officials, and that network ties that bridge different coalitions add significant explanatory leverage to resource-based explanations of access.

TI Professionalising British central government bureaucracy c. 1850: The
   accounting dimension
SO JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Northcote-Trevelyan Report (1854) recommended fundamental changes to public policy which included the replacement of patronage by examination as the basis for recruitment to the British Civil Service and of seniority by merit as the foundation for promotion decisions. This paper examines the accounting dimension of reforms designed to achieve enhanced administrative efficiency and greater economy in the operation of government departments. A growing interest in the role of accounting within British government during the second quarter of the nineteenth century is elucidated, and prevailing ideas concerning how accounting within government departments and accountability from the executive to parliament might be performed more efficiently and effectively are uncovered. The battle between divergent pressure groups concerning who should possess jurisdiction over accounting work is explored, and the solution to this problematic is found to connect with the nature of a central government accounting system that was itself undergoing significant change. Consistency between the Northcote-Trevelyan recommendations and ongoing internal initiatives designed to ensure the competence of clerks recruited to undertake accounting work and subsequently applying for promotion to a higher grade is demonstrated.

AB Participatory budgeting (PB) has emerged as a tool for empowering marginalized communities and advancing social justice through public deliberation and advocacy. However, public deliberation scholars have contested the appropriate roles of social justice, activism, and equity. PB bridges deliberation, advocacy, and equity, as it strives to accomplish social change. We detail how the first cycle of Greensboro PB navigated tensions between residents who sought social change and government officials who wished to maintain the status quo. We argue PB is an example of public deliberation that fosters social justice sensibilities among participants and conclude with applied recommendations for design improvements.

ID POLICY; POLITICS; CHOICE
AB Policy decisions are greatly affected by the way issues are understood collectively by policy-makers and the public. Naturally, advocates attempt to affect these dynamics by drawing attention to one dimension or another. Lobbyists outside government, such as political leaders and civil servants within governing institutions, try to spin or frame the issues on which they work. Research on framing is difficult, however, because of a methodological complication: no individual actor single-handedly determines how issues are defined collectively. The collective dynamics of agenda-setting and framing are subject to strong competitive forces, maintaining a stable equilibrium at most times, but also to threshold effects that can occasionally lead to rapid shifts in issue definitions. Research strategies used to study one face of framing (at the individual level) are ill suited to study the second face of framing (aggregate shifts in collective issue definitions). We discuss the two faces of framing as they relate to recent literature on policy-making in the European Union and we suggest some avenues for future research.

AB Our stylized rent-seeking model of privatization elucidates the empirical problems of making and implementing privatization. We treat privatization as a strategic game with the public enterprise's employees and an outside investor competing for privatized rents by lobbying. At another level, bureaucrats (the privatizing authority) are concerned with social welfare and the resources spent by the contestants. Our two main results establish that increased selfishness of the government reduces the sale price of the company while increasing the probability of privatization and that a budgetary constraint on the employees' lobbying increases the probability of privatization while reducing the sale price.

AB This article examines the visit of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop to Washington DC in June 1983. Scholars have speculated that the visit was motivated by a desire to normalise Grenada's troubled relations with the United States or, alternatively, that it was a public relations and lobbying exercise. This article concludes that Grenadian government officials variously viewed the visit as a public relations exercise, an opportunity for dialogue and an opportunity to gain economic support. For the United States the prospect of Bishop's visit prompted a reassessment of its Grenada policy and, after Bishop met senior US officials, resulted in a hardening of existing policy.

ID IDENTITY
AB The UN Secretariat's role in the expansion of peacekeeping after the cold war is debated. Different theoretical accounts offer competing interpretations: principal-agent models and sociological institutionalism tend to emphasize the Secretariat's risk-averse behaviour; organizational learning scholarship and international political sociology find evidence of the Secretariat's activism; constructivism analyses instances of both. I argue that the UN Secretariat can be both enthusiastic and cautious about new tasks depending on the circumstances and the issue area. For example, UN officials have been the driving force behind the development of public information campaigns by peacekeeping missions aimed at the local population. During the cold war, it was not regarded as necessary for UN missions to communicate with the public in the area of operation: their interlocutors were parties to the conflict and the diplomatic community. With the deployment of the first multidimensional missions in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, UN staff realized the need to explain the organization's role to the local population and provide information about UN-supported elections. In promoting this innovation, they played the role of policy entrepreneurs. The institutionalization of this innovation, however, was not an automatic process and required continuous advocacy by UN information staff.

   AND CHINA'S ACCESSION TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
LA English
DT Article
ID INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS
AB Tobacco market liberalization can have a profound impact on health. This article analyzes internal documents of British American Tobacco ( BAT), released as a result of litigation in the United States, in order to examine the company's attempts to influence negotiations over China's accession to the World Trade Organization. The documents demonstrate that BAT attempted to influence these negotiations through a range of mechanisms, including personal access of BAT employees and lobbyists to policymakers; employment of former civil servants from key U. K. government departments; use of organized business groups such as the Multinational Chairmen's Group and the European Round Table; and participation and leadership in forums organized by Chatham House. These processes contributed to significant concessions on the liberalization of the tobacco market in China, although the failure to break the Chinese state monopoly over the manufacture and distribution of cigarettes has ensured that foreign tobacco companies' share of the Chinese market has remained small. World Trade Organization accession has nevertheless led to a profound restructuring of the Chinese tobacco industry in anticipation of foreign competition, which may result in more market-based and internationally oriented Chinese tobacco firms.

ID SOCIAL-POLICIES; REDUCTION
AB This article investigates the way in which the World Bank constructs knowledge on poverty by identifying analytic institutions inside the organisation where ideas are developed, 'anti-poverty advocates' that populate these institutions and the strategies they employ to foster their agenda. By doing so, the article challenges two common critiques against the organisation. First, the Bank is often seen as an instrument of powerful industrialised countries to impose Western norms on developing countries; second, the Bank has contributed to worsening the situation in developing countries through the policies adopted. I argue that both assumptions are overstated. First, an in-depth analysis of the organisation's operational and organisational level shows a high level of internal advocacy that provides evidence that the Bank as a bureaucracy independently shapes global politics. Second, comparing the discursive level with developments on the policy and operational level reveals that the poverty or social agenda has grown incrementally from the late 1960s even in times when neoliberalism dominated world politics and economy. The article goes beyond such an organisational analysis in critically assessing how the Bank, by making developing countries 'legible', has provided standardised responses that ignore local social knowledge with the consequence of crude and self-defeating interventions.

AB Social movement scholars credit feminist transnational advocacy networks with putting violence against women on the United Nations (UN) security agenda, as evidenced by Resolution 1325 and numerous other UN Security Council statements on gender, peace and security. Such accounts neglect the significance of superpower politics for shaping the aims of women's bureaucracies and non-governmental organizations in the UN system. This article highlights how the fall of the Soviet Union transformed the delineation of 'women's issues' at the UN and calls attention to the extent that the new focus upon 'violence against women' has been shaped by post-Cold War US global policing practices. Resolution 1325's call for gender mainstreaming of peacekeeping operations reflects the tension between feminist advocates' increased influence in security discourse and continuing reports of peacekeeper perpetrated sexual violence, abuse and exploitation.

AB This article describes the development and dissemination of an evidence-based Policy Statement and Background Papers by the Australian Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology Association (ARATA). An experienced project team was engaged to conduct literature reviews and member consultations, develop resources and implement a targeted advocacy strategy that included a policy launch and meetings with government officials. The Policy Statement and Background Papers have enabled ARATA to represent the views of Assistive Technology (AT) Practitioners in consultations around the National Disability Insurance Scheme and other AT-related inquiries. In ARATA's experience, developing a policy statement and disseminating it through a targeted advocacy strategy is an effective way for a not-for-profit professional organisation to influence government policy.

TI US Neoconservative Support and Policy Activism for Bosnia, 1992-1995:
   Correcting the Record
SO JOURNAL OF MUSLIM MINORITY AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB The aim of this article is to trace neoconservative thought in the US and policy activism on the role of the US in Bosnia during the 1992-1995 genocide. This paper argues that, on the issue of intervention in Bosnia, neoconservatives in the US comprised two camps. Neoconservative former government officials were early and consistent advocates of an assertive US intervention in Bosnia. However, the neoconservative academics were a heterogeneous group divided over the question of US intervention. Yet, both the former government officials and several academics came together in supporting President Bill Clinton's decision to deploy US troops to enforce the Dayton Peace Accords. While sharply criticized in the Muslim world for their Middle East policies, neoconservative advocacy for Bosnia and Bosnian Muslims during 1992-1995 has been largely overlooked. Analysing neoconservatives' activism on Bosnia provides for a more nuanced understanding of the US neoconservative foreign policy legacy.

ID VOICE
AB Tourism trade associations play a critical, though little understood role in tourism policy development and implementation. As the direct conduit between industry and government, associations seek to develop a reciprocal arrangement with government departments, senior bureaucrats and elected officials with the goal of influencing policy to either benefits their members or minimise damage to them. This paper examines the role of tourism trade associations in government relations activities by analysing the roles played by different types of provincial associations in Canada. The study found that, depending on their size, associations liaised with more than 20 different government departments on a wide array of issues. However, their direct links are closest with tourism departments.

   CONSUMPTION; PROPOSALS; COVERAGE; OPINION; OBESITY
AB Context Scotland is the first country in the world to pass legislation introducing a minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol in an attempt to reduce consumption and associated harms by increasing the price of the cheapest alcohol. We investigated the competing ways in which policy stakeholders presented the debate. We then established whether a change in framing helped explain the policy's emergence. Methods We conducted a detailed policy case study through analysis of evidence submitted to the Scottish parliament, and in-depth, one-to-one interviews (n = 36) with politicians, civil servants, advocates, researchers, and industry representatives. Findings Public- and voluntary-sector stakeholders tended to support MUP, while industry representatives were more divided. Two markedly different ways of presenting alcohol as a policy problem were evident. Critics of MUP (all of whom were related to industry) emphasized social disorder issues, particularly among young people, and hence argued for targeted approaches. In contrast, advocates for MUP (with the exception of those in industry) focused on alcohol as a health issue arising from overconsumption at a population level, thus suggesting that population-based interventions were necessary. Industry stakeholders favoring MUP adopted a hybrid framing, maintaining several aspects of the critical framing. Our interview data showed that public health advocates worked hard to redefine the policy issue by deliberately presenting a consistent alternative framing. Conclusions Framing alcohol policy as a broad, multisectoral, public health issue that requires a whole-population approach has been crucial to enabling policymakers to seriously consider MUP, and public health advocates intentionally presented alcohol policy in this way. This reframing helped prioritize public health considerations in the policy debate and represents a deliberate strategy for consideration by those advocating for policy change around the world and in other public health areas.

DT Article; Early Access
AB How do we best defend the rule of law against its attackers, both within the European Union and outside of it? Often, the rule of law has been perceived as a domain belonging to jurists, lawyers, bureaucrats, or politicians. Yet at its most fundamental, the rule of law needs to be thought of from a citizen's perspective. When enforced, it guarantees freedoms and liberties for citizens and enables us to live peacefully. In this article, we propose a citizen-centric rule of law agenda based on a deep conviction that it is if and when it becomes a citizen-based societal principle that its many attackers are best countered. We discuss the challenges and necessities of rule of law promotion and propose an assessment approach called the "living list". We close with a call for citizen-scholars to fight for the rule of law, the most precious human invention of all time.

AB This paper examines the determinants of sector-specific regulation imposed on broadband markets related both to efficiency objectives of regulators and to those of narrowly defined interest groups. We test hypotheses derived from the normative and positive theoretical literature employing recent panel data on 27 European Union member states taking into account en-dogeneity of the underlying regulation and market structure variables. Our empirical specification employs three different estimators based on instrumental variables in order to identify causal effects. We find evidence supporting both regulators pursuing normative objectives and inefficiencies related to regulatory path dependence, bureaucracy goals and an inadequate consideration of competition from mobile broadband networks. Our results call for adjustments in the institutional design of the decision-making process under the current European Union regulatory framework.

AB Consultation of major interest groups is a widespread administrative practice in many EU member states. To date it is unclear, however, how advancing European integration influences domestic consultation practices. This article examines the impact of European integration on domestic consultation practices by conceptualizing how the underlying rationales of government-interest group interactions and the level of involvement of interest groups are affected by European integration. The study draws on original survey data on senior civil servants in Britain and the Netherlands to empirically examine these effects. European integration is related in a limited way to domestic consultation practices, both in Britain and the Netherlands. This small but significant effect is mostly observed during the process of domestic preference formulation in EU-level policy making. Our findings suggest that intra-organizational processes, for example organizational routines and task-specialization, potentially play a greater role than has thus far been appreciated in Europeanization studies.

AB The degree of rent dissipation is studied in extended two-sided contests that involve two types of efforts. While usual contestants expend resources in trying to win the contested prize, potential recipients of the rent-seeking efforts also participate in the contest. This is due to uncertainty regarding the source of power in the contest that induces the bureaucrats to expend resources to increase their share in the rent-seeking efforts by trying to appear as the party controlling the allocation of the prize. We show that the existing theoretical and empirical studies are incomplete and may underestimate the extent of rent dissipation.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF ETHNO-NATIONAL LOBBIES ON THE US FOREIGN POLICY:
   HISTORY OF THE UKRAINIAN DIASPORA
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE the Ukrainian diaspora; ethnic lobby; USA; lobbying
AB The article examines the political potential of the Ukrainian ethnic lobby in US foreign policy. Proceeding from the fact that ethnic lobbies in the US are able to overcome the institutional system of checks and balances, the authors try to establish the extent and limits of the influence of the Ukrainian lobby.
   The given lobby is based on a small-numbered Ukrainian diaspora in the US, which was formed as a result of four waves of migration from the territory of modern Ukraine, due to various reasons. As a result, the Ukrainian diaspora in the United States has developed as a highly heterogeneous and multi-layered community.
   The main organization of the Ukrainian diaspora is the Ukrainian Committee of the Congress of America, which is an umbrella structure for organizations of economic, cultural and political profile, as well as for associations of veterans, women and youth.
   The Ukrainian diaspora in the US uses the following tools for political purposes. First, the diaspora organizations strive to encourage the activities of their low-and middle-ranking civil servants to form an optimal agenda. Diaspora immigrants from experts and media persons are connected to this process. Secondly, the Ukrainian diaspora has established cooperation with other Eastern European diasporas. The cooperation allows the Ukrainian Americans to use electoral potential in the states of the Northwest and Midwest of the United States and to take joint initiatives in communication with the Congress. Together, Eastern European diasporas have some influence on the American foreign policy process when it comes to the Congress, but the scope of influence should not be exaggerated. However, the demand for anti-Russian arguments is formed within the American establishment, that brings the agenda of the Ukrainian diaspora to the forefront of foreign policy debate. This allows us to conclude that the potential for political influence of the Ukrainian ethnic lobby in the United States is limited without a suitable international context.

AB Objective: We reflect upon the processes of mental health administration in Australia with reference to George Orwell's novel,1984. Conclusions: Mental healthcare in Australia is distorted by politicisation, spin and a refusal to acknowledge the reality of the current situation. These challenges for mental healthcare demonstrate some similarities with the Ministries of Truth and Plenty, which conversely performed as their opposites in Orwell's novel. Psychiatrists and their professional bodies should play a greater role in advocacy for clinician-led, evidence-based services in partnership with our communities.

DT Article
DE rulemaking; preproposal stage; National Park Service; interest groups;
   Yellowstone; frames; regulation
AB The preproposal stage of the rulemaking process is notoriously understudied, but enormously important in determining regulatory outputs. Recently, Rinfret (2011c) analyzed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) rulemaking process and developed a frame analysis model to interpret stakeholder influence during the preproposal stage. Rinfret argues that stakeholders use three frames to influence agency rulemaking, including an expertise, a fiscal feasibility, and an information frame. This article tests this model to determine whether it is applicable to other federal agencies such as the National Park Service (NPS). Through an analysis of stakeholder framing within the 2012 NPS Yellowstone Winter Use Rule, this research confirms that Rinfret's model is indeed applicable to the NPS process. Therefore, this research suggests that this theoretical model examining stakeholder influence is applicable to other public land agencies, and arguably can be applied across the bureaucracy.

   intervention; schools
ID SERVICES; CENTERS; SYSTEM; REFORM; MODELS; YOUTH; CARE
AB Purpose: To assess the availability of public and private financing sources to support comprehensive school mental health programs. The paper focuses on "expanded school mental health" (ESMH) programs, which provide a full array of mental health promotion and intervention services to youth in general and special education through school-community partnerships.
   Methods: A range of strategies to fund ESMH services are reviewed, including fee-for-service funding, as well as grants, contracts, and other mechanisms from federal, state, local, and private sources.
   Results: An objective national study of the characteristics and financing of ESMH programs has yet to be conducted. Existing evidence suggests that funding for these programs is patchy and tenuous. Many programs are being funded through fee-for-service programs, which generally only support the provision of more intensive services (e.g., assessment, therapy) and are associated with significant bureaucracy and other concerns (e.g., the need to diagnose students). As programs move to enhance funding for 4preventive and mental health-promoting activities and services, there is an increasing need for grants, contracts, and other sources of support.
   Conclusion: Progress in the national movement toward ESMH will be promoted through an interconnected agenda of quality improvement, evaluation of program effectiveness, and the advancement of advocacy. These developments will facilitate policy improvements and increased funding for the full continuum of mental health promotion and intervention in the schools.

ID GOVERNANCE
AB Background Promoting the sub-national ownership of national health initiatives is essential for efforts to achieve national health goals in federal systems where sub-national governments are semi-autonomous. Between 2008 and 2015, Nigerian government implemented a pilot free maternal and child health (MCH) programme in selected states to improve MCH by reducing physical and financial barriers of access to services. This study was conducted to better understand why the programme was neither adopted nor scaled-up by sub-national governments after pilot phase. Methods We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the programme in Imo and Niger States, with data from programme documents, in-depth interviews (45) and focus group discussions (16) at State and community levels. Data was analysed using manual thematic coding approach. Result Our analysis indicates that the programme design had two mutually dependent goals, which were also in tension with one another: 1. To ensure programme performance, the designers sought to shield its implementation from sub-national government politics and bureaucracy; and 2. To gain the buy-in of the same sub-national government politicians and bureaucrats, the designers sought to demonstrate programme performance. The potential for community advocacy for sub-national adoption and scale-up was not considered in the design. Therefore, limited involvement of sub-national governments in the programme design limited sub-national ownership during implementation. And limited oversight of implementation by sub-national government policymakers limited programme performance. Conclusion Efforts to promote sub-national ownership of national initiatives in decentralised health systems should prioritise inclusiveness in design, implementation, and oversight, and well-resourced community advocacy to sub-national governments for adoption and scale-up.

AB Much is known about how to change alcohol policy to reduce harm, but despite the evidence little action has been taken at the national level in the United States. Government officials have shown little interest in putting prevention research results to work. The influence of the alcohol industry on policy-makers combined with free market ideology has thwarted change despite the efforts of advocacy groups working to reduce harm. The role of the alcohol industry at the national and international level serves as a powerful deterrent to policy change.

   convention; evaluation criteria for participation; use of indicators
AB The paper explores the role of a participatory approach in the outcome of the Finnish sustainable development indicator (SDI) exercise in 1998-2002. The process is analysed through three main objectives: to achieve stronger democracy, better quality of the end product and a more effective process. The analysis is further structured by a set of criteria needed for successful participation and differentiation of types of participants. The criteria comprise three main aspects: fairness, competence and social learning. In addition to the normally mentioned stakeholders (e.g. citizens and interest groups) participants also include experts and civil servants. Using the set of criteria above the participatory approach of the Finnish SDI process is then evaluated, and in the light of this evaluation the paper also discusses the specifications needed as evaluation criteria for national level policy programme processes like developing the SDIs. The results are based on documentation of the indicator task force meetings, written comments and a study of the putative end-users conducted after the publication of the indicators. The results show that the intense and broad participation of experts and civil servants increased the competence of the outcome and led to greater efficiency in working methods. However, this led to technocratic participation, absence of democratic participation and absence of social learning. Thus the ultimate goal of SDIs to contribute to achieving sustainability was not reached. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   programmes
SO EVIDENCE & POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE evidence use; programmatic approach; bureaucracy; malaria
ID POLICY; BUREAUCRACY; HEALTH
AB Background: Conceptualisations of what it means to use evidence in policymaking often appear divided between two extremes. On the one side are works presenting it as the implementation of research findings - particularly evaluations of intervention effect. In contrast stand theoretically informed works exploring the multiple meanings of evidence use, political complexities, and the constructed nature of research evidence itself. The first perspective has been criticised as oversimplistic, while the latter can make it difficult to answer questions of what might be good, or improved, uses of evidence in policymaking.
   Methods: To further debate, this paper develops a 'programmatic approach' to evidence use, drawing on theories of institutional decision making and empirical work on evidence use within 11 National Malaria Control Programmes in Africa. We apply the programmatic approach by investigating the key goals and tasks of programme officials, recognising that these will shape the routines and logics followed affecting evidence utilisation. We then map out the forms, sources, features, and applications of evidence that serve programme officials in their goals.
   Findings: In the case of malaria programmes, evidence use was understood in relation to tasks including: advocacy for funding, budget allocation, regulation development, national planning, and identification of information gaps - all of which might require different evidence sources, forms, and applications.
   Discussion and conclusions: Ultimately the programmatic approach aims to facilitate clearer understanding of what uses of evidence are appropriate to policymakers, while also allowing critical reflection on whether such uses are 'good' from both programme and broader social perspectives.

AB In this paper, I study the effect of political elites' career incentives on China's trade policy formation. I propose a theoretical dynamic view in which China's authoritarian leaders can preempt protectionist actions of their selectorate (bureaucrats) by offering them future promotion opportunities within the authoritarian hierarchy as long as the leaders can credibly commit to these political promises. Drawing on a database of China's sectors for 1999-2007, the empirical results support the dynamic perspective that while political organization still matters for China's trade policy outcomes, it is less likely for a sector with a higher promotion expectation score to get politically organized.

AB This Article proposes an innovative approach to remedying the crisis of political inequality: using law to facilitate organizing by the poor and working class, not only as workers, but also as tenants, debtors, welfare beneficiaries, and others. The piece draws on the social-movements literature, and the successes and failures of labor law, to show how law can supplement the deficient regimes of campaign finance and lobbying reform and enable lower-income groups to build organizations capable of countervailing the political power of the wealthy. As such, the Article offers a new direction forward for the public-law literature on political power and political inequality. It also offers critical lessons for government officials, organizers, and advocates seeking to respond to the inequalities made painfully evident by the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI The role of economists in liberalizing Swedish agriculture
SO ECON JOURNAL WATCH
LA English
DT Article
AB I examine the process that led to major reforms in agriculture in
   Sweden, culminating in 1990. Economists were largely responsible for
   putting the issue on the agenda. Using a public choice perspective, they
   reformulated the debate. Who benefited, who paid, and what were the true
   costs? The reformulation illuminated an "iron triangle"-farmers and their
   interest organizations, politicians, and the bureaucracy. When the new
   policy coalition gained the initiative, connections and support from the
   Ministry of Finance were critical, and led to a new will reaching the Prime
   Minister and finally into the bureaucracy itself, the Ministry of Agriculture.
   Economists and others overcame the iron triangle. Enlightened discourse
   played no small role in overcoming resistance.

   British; imperialism in Malaya; Indian overseas diaspora
AB Discussion of Patrick Manning's legacy as a world historian must include the way he taught us to write historical narratives that not only shift between the perspectives of diverse individuals and interest groups, but also bring those perspectives into conversation with each other. This relational world history-writing methodology requires analysis of both local, transregional, and global historical forces and the experiences of people who tried to deploy or resist those forces. In the spirit of Manning's approach, this article highlights how competing narratives about emigration from Britain and the Indian subcontinent to British Malaya from the 1920s until 1940 can be understood more clearly by demonstrating how three interest groups defined their relationship to the colony's Malayan Indian population. Analyzing this contested discourse among British civil servants, Indian immigrant community representatives, and individuals trying to rally the Indians Overseas labor diaspora illustrates the kinds of circumstances that had the potential to promote or constrain meaningful social change for Indian-born and Indian-descended settlers in Malaya.

AB This study investigates the framing of immigration by political actors in US election news from 2006 to 2014 and how they present the issue as a problem (for society, for immigrants, no problem frames). Through a content analysis of national newspapers coverage of midterm and presidential elections, we explore the relationship between the people sourced in the stories and the framing of immigration as a problem. Results show that despite an increasingly competitive framing field (with more non-governmental, non-elite sources salient in news coverage), government officials and candidates are still often mentioned in stories on immigration. Seen along party lines, framing of immigration as a problem for society is more associated with Republican government officials and candidates for office than with Democrats. Special interest groups and Law enforcement sources are also attached to immigration framing. Implications for the understanding of how the immigration issue is framed during electoral periods are discussed.

AB This article sheds new light on the interaction between trade policy formation, politics, and the economy in Colombia in the 20th century. The author combines original ex post interview data on the apertura process that took off in the 1990s with a meta-analysis of earlier studies on the political and economic history of Colombia. The analysis allows for a better understanding of the applicability of standard political-economy models to explain empirically the levels of protection of the manufacturing industry. More specifically, the article sheds new light on the determination of tariff levels, the interaction of conflicting interest groups, the degree of autonomy of the government and the bureaucrats, and the relationship between the ideological profiles of governments and the orientation of their trade policies. It is argued that the Colombian case has wider relevance for understanding the formation of trade policies in other countries in Latin America, especially in contexts with diversified economic structures and shifting government coalitions.

DE Freedom of Information Act; transparency; accountability; right to know
ID EMBARRASSMENT
AB "Transparency" has become a widely recognized, even taken for granted, value in contemporary democracies, but this has been true only since the 1970s. For all of the obvious virtues of transparency for democracy, they have not always been recognized or they have been recognized, as in the U.S. Freedom of Information Act of 1966, with significant qualifications. This essay catalogs important shortcomings of transparency for democracy, as when it clashes with national security, personal privacy, and the importance of maintaining the capacity of government officials to talk frankly with one another without fear that half-formulated ideas, thoughts, and proposals will become public. And when government information becomes public, that does not make it equally available to all-publicity is not in itself democratic, as public information (as in open legislative committee hearings) is more readily accessed by empowered groups with lobbyists able to attend and monitor the provision of the information. Transparency is an element in democratic government, but it is by no means a perfect emblem of democracy.

DE policy based evidence; Ireland; research(er) deficit; lone parents
AB Utilising a case study of evidence-based policy (EBP) commissioned by government we explore how academic outputs can serve several purposes, depending on the political milieu and the values and ideologies of any given party. Our commissioned research was being carried out in the context of significant policy change for lone parents in Ireland which saw the introduction of labour market activation. The research was initially used by the then Government to appease the Opposition to the highly emotive policy change. Following a general election, Opposition and advocacy groups called on policymakers to acknowledge the report they had commissioned. Concepts of research(er) deficit, normative reality and a shifting 'policy agora' are explored to highlight how the political context shaped the uptake of the research findings. We followed the debate by drawing on publicly available documentary evidence relevant to the policy of lone parent activation in Ireland from pertinent parliamentary and committee debates involving all stakeholders, that is the Government, civil servants, Opposition and advocacy groups, to ascertain what happened with the research and why did it happen. Attention is given to the consequences of producing outputs that diverge from political values and ideologies, whereby research can be subject to manipulation to discredit and invalidate findings.

   broker policy change in rehabilitation services
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH-CARE; GOVERNMENT; GOVERNANCE; MEDICINE; AGENDA
AB How should bureaucrats engage effectively and ethically with stakeholders to achieve legitimate policy change ? This essay draws upon findings from a case study of the introduction of an evidence-based rehabilitation program for injured workers with soft-tissue injuries in a workers' compensation jurisdiction in Australia. Despite initial enthusiasm for collaborative policy reform, clinical associations soon withdrew their support. In a classic case of venue-shopping, a coalition of clinical associations formed in opposition to the foundation principles of the proposed policy, overturning the bureaucrats' preferred consultation strategy: a think-tank comprising of invited clinical experts. The policy game turned from highly cooperative to fiercely competitive. These policy upheavals are interpreted through the lens of two theoretical perspectives: Sabatier's Advocacy Coalition framework, and Scharpf's Actor-centred Institutionalism framework. The contrasts in perspectives are melded into propositions for bureaucrats seeking to engage with stakeholders in a contested policy drama.

AB This paper examines the nature and character of corruption and presents a general, overview and comparison of corrupt practices in,the United States and China. Neither country is corruption free but the United States has a substantially lower rate of perceived corruption than China. To understand United States corrupt practices, the focus is. on three spheres: bureaucracy, elected (political) officials, and business. The U.S. bureaucracy is generally, clean and an. historic explanation is offered as to why; for the other two spheres (U.S. elected officials and business), laws, law enforcement, public expectation, and professional standards guide transactions and control/reduce corruption. But the Chinese political context cannot be neatly separated into the three areas of bureaucracy, political officials, and economic activities. Instead, relevant Chinese activities are a blend of these categories. To understand Chinese corrupt practices, the focus is on the nature of collusive corruption, the possible ineffectiveness of severe penalties, and the more theoretical issues of the role of laws and law enforcement, and the importance of a corruption-free bureaucratic instrument.

DT Article
DE Lawmaking; External advisors; Policy formulation; Government capacity
AB It has been accepted for a long time that ministries use external support during the lawmaking process. When the Ministry of Economics delegated the drafting of an entire bill to a private law firm, concerns about governmental capacity and an intransparent route of access for special interests have been raised. The empirical analysis of delegated law drafting and temporary employment of experts, seconded from business firms and interest groups to ministries, shows that both phenomena remain small in scale and therefore of limited impact. By looking at the reasons why there is a "law drafting by contract" at all, it is revealed that not all German ministries are sufficiently staffed with qualified personnel to deal with more complex and innovative subjects of legislation. Given the high expectations which are addressed at government sovereignty during the lawmaking process, this appears as an unresolved problem of policy-making in the German political system.

AB This paper analyses the political economy of economic reform and the ways in which the characteristics of developmental states have been changed in this reform process. It does this with attention to the experience of structural transformation in the manufacturing, information technology and financial sectors in Korea. Using the coalition theory of policy reform, the main finding from these cases is that the relationships among politicians, bureaucrats and interest groups have been altered so that interest groups' power has been strengthened compared to politicians and bureaucrats. Although a crisis is important in promoting economic reform, broader-ranging trends, such as democratisation, globalisation and technological progress, have also been important fundamental forces. Even with change, the reform process in Korea continues to reflect the legacies of the developmental state, with the state still playing an important role in planning, implementing and sustaining economic reform.

AB In the present study we examine how Finnish vocational education and training (VET) experts reflect on multiculturalism in the aftermath of a major reform. The research material consists of interviews with educational policy experts in Finnish VET, namely: principals, government officials and lobbyists (N = 11). A qualitative thematic analysis reveals the following three latent themes through which experts reflect on multiculturalism: 1) multiculturalism as individualisation; 2) multiculturalism as competition; and 3) multiculturalism as shared responsibility. The results show that Finnish VET experts see multiculturalism as a critical challenge for education and working life. On the other hand, it is still unclear whether the 2018 VET reform will be able to resolve the different dilemmas and contradictions that the experts connect with multiculturalism. Experts understand multiculturalism narrowly as synonymous with immigration and as something that happens in encounters with Finns, even though it is not shared by Finns themselves. While most of the experts argue that personalisation and working life are particularly important for immigrants and students with an immigrant background, others are worried about the future of broader social competences in Finnish VET.

AFPI is working towards the establishment of a distinct academic discipline 'family medicine' for doctors pursuing primary care vocation within the mainstream medical education system in India. AFPI adopted a multi-pronged approach engaging political leadership, bureaucracy, higher judiciary and other stakeholders. In 2018, a public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court of India. In pursuance to the Supreme Court of India order, AFPI approached the ministry as well as the Medical Council of India. In 2018 we had received written assurance from the Prime Minister's Office - PMO that the family medicine discipline will be addressed in the NMC bill. Earlier family medicine was mentioned only as part of the National Health Policies (NHP 2002 and NHP 2017) and finally, it has become part of the act, the National Medical Commission Act 2019.

SO PHYSICAL EDUCATOR-US
LA English
DT Article
AB Physical activity and extracurricular activity has become a topic of importance in the United States. The nation's government officials have brought to light the need for increased awareness, advocacy, and support of the participation of youth with disabilities in recreation and leisure activities (e.g., extracurricular and school-sanctioned sport). The Government Office of Accountability recently released a "Dear Colleague Letter" bringing awareness to the need to improve acceptance and accountability in including students with disabilities in extracurricular physical activities. The purpose of this article was to provide implementation strategies for inclusion of students with disabilities into physical education opportunities and extracurricular athletics.

AB This article analyses the organizational and political changes experienced by SOFOFA, the Chilean industrialist main organization. In a time span characterized by growing confrontational politics, the industrialist also implemented organizational changes in SOFOFA and engaged in a prolonged and profound debate about their relationship with the public sector. The III Industry National Conference, organized by SOFOFA and held in June 1953, marked a turning point. It signaled a much more critical stance towards the model of capitalist modernization since 1939. Propelled by the uncertainty and the threat unleashed by the economic interventionism of the second Ibanez administration (1952-1958), the conference brought to the fore the disagreements and the generational conflict between those members who wanted a more vigorous entrepreneurial position vis-a-vis the authorities and those who preferred to maintain the traditional lobbying methods and informal corporatist arrangements with government officials and congressmen.

AB Emotions clearly matter in social movements, but it is less apparent how social movement participants actively handle emotions in their line of activities. In this article, the authors address this question by examining how two reproductive rights coalitions in Peru employ and manage emotions in relation to different actors who they must deal with to influence policies. Empirical materials consist of participant observation, focus groups, and individual interviews conducted with the coalitions and their members. Grounded theory was used to analyze the data. The authors distinguish relationships with five relevant actors: the internal members of the coalitions, allies, the general public, the Catholic Church as the major opponent, and government officials as the main target. As each relationship requires distinct emotion work, coalition members simultaneously adjust to contradictory emotional expectations while actively evoking and coordinating emotions. The authors refer to this as the orchestration of emotion work.

SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS
LA English
DT Article
ID PROTECTION; CIVILIANS; BRITAIN; FRAMES
AB The detention of child soldiers is an example of an intractable policy controversy. In their advocacy of governance responses, policy-relevant actors adopt reductionist frames either of ?victims? ? that require special protections ? or of ?perpetrators? that necessitate the detention of individuals deemed threats. This article examines how the framing of a controversy influences policy responses. The ways in which policy actors in Canada and the United States acted from their frames and responded to frames of others on the issue of the detention of child soldiers is analyzed. Forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), government officials, and military lawyers ? across two national contexts ? to build a comprehensive picture of these framing contests. Findings show that policy actors in both countries employed frame-diverging moves that prolong policy controversies. However, the adoption of the Canadian doctrine presents an example of a convergence of frames. NGOs and government officials engaged in strategies to create a shared framing that allowed to move beyond the perceived dilemma of child soldiers either as ?victims? or ?perpetrators.? These findings enhance not only our understanding of how framing dynamics shape governance responses but also demonstrate opportunities of using the research on framing processes in investigating complex experiences of children in conflict zones.

TI Does Private Regulation Preempt Public Regulation?
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF-REGULATION; GREEN CLUBS; OPINION
AB Previous research has emphasized corporate lobbying as a pathway through which businesses influence government policy. This article examines a less-studied mode of influence: private regulation, defined as voluntary efforts by firms to restrain their own behavior. We argue that firms can use modest private regulations as a political strategy to preempt more stringent public regulations. To test this hypothesis, we administered experiments to three groups that demand environmental regulations: voters, activists, and government officials. Our experiments revealed how each group responded to voluntary environmental programs (VEPs) by firms. Relatively modest VEPs dissuaded all three groups from seeking more draconian government regulations, a finding with important implications for social welfare. We observed these effects most strongly when all companies within an industry joined the voluntary effort. Our study documents an understudied source of corporate power, while also exposing the limits of private regulation as a strategy for influencing government policy.

AB Long an expatriate-run concern, leprosy control was subsumed as a key component of rural public health in the years following Nigerian Independence in 1960 by the enlisting of a cadre of African inspectors, deployed across an existing institutional landscape by a newly Nigerianized medical bureaucracy. The performative norms of leprosy control, once thoroughly colonial and suffused with the ripe vocabulary of a long-entrenched missionary diaspora, were renovated at the heart of a new concern with rural public health more broadly, as the needs, expectations and hierarchies encoded in relations between patient, court, bureaucrat and medical worker shifted and settled in accordance with new political horizons. For health workers, issues of patient and worker mobility, drug delivery, patient and community expectation, and their own physical and financial security were dramatized in a series of commentaries, complaints and reports denoting deeply felt anxieties over the viability of careers in the service of Nigerian health. This article outlines struggles surrounding leprosy control and rural public health work in the Qua Iboe Mission catchment, administered by the newly created Ikot Ekpene Medical Field Unit. It documents a shift in medical work from European missionary to national and technocratic, the foregrounding of concerns with African (worker and patient) welfare and mobility, and the emergence of novel post-colonial forms of public health advocacy and politics along the highways and byways of Ibibio- and Annang-speaking areas of southeastern Nigeria in the 1960s.

AB This paper argues that the use of biometrics by the State's to control migration can be conceived of as a form of biopower in a Foucauldian sense. By way of example, the case of Argentina from 2003 to 2015 will be qualitatively analyzed. Based on rulings and addresses by government officials three main questions will be answered: What is the role of biometrics in recent Argentine public policies? How does it attain such status? How is biometrics adopted as a policy option for migration control? Argentina proves to be a useful case in that it has recently changed its migration policies, linking the discourse on human rights with the advocacy of migration controls based on biometrics.

AB The H-2A temporary agricultural guest worker program has become the primary source of labor to harvest citrus. An estimated 80% of the 2016-17 citrus crop was harvested by H-2A workers. This paper outlines an ongoing project to interview and summarize the economic and political perspectives of competing interest groups regarding H-2A and temporary guest worker programs in general. Three interest groups are targeted to solicit opinions about the H-2A program administration and how well the economic interests of growers, domestic workers, and foreign workers are being met. The groups surveyed are agricultural employers, including growers and farm labor contractors, worker advocates, and government officials charged with overseeing the H-2A program. Results of the survey provide insights into how the existing program could or should be modified as part of a comprehensive immigration reform package.

TI A Plea for a Sociology of Political Problematizations of School
SO POLITIX
LA French
DT Article
AB French political scientists have neglected school public policies. The main studies so far are due to foreign political scientists or, since the nineties, to sociologists and historians. The latter insist on the development of neo-managerial forms of school governance and the resistances they cause, but they tend to focus on the grassroot level and on the effects of public policies and reforms on pupils' performances in terms of social inequalities. Without denying interest to this perspective, this paper focuses on the question of the "problematization" of school issues as Michel Foucault defined it, ie a "set of discursive or nondiscursive practices that makes something enter into the play of the true and false, and constitutes it as an object for thought". Such a way of analyzing school reforms implies paying more attention to high civil servants, experts, political parties, trade-unions, and various interest groups and their fights to impose a new conception of the main function of School.

With the social development, a series of concept changes have been seen in understanding to public management and definition of ethics. The paper is a review and reflection of the historical and current situations of administrative ethics, which illustrates the value orientation of public interests and the common interests of human race: while enjoying fruits of economy and culture development together, each government should consider how to enhance coordination, to reach an agreement and to avoid disputes, so as to establish a modem governmental mechanism Meanwhile, conscience, responsibility, modem service consciousness for civil servants should be gained; the reality that interest groups impede to share development space on purpose for established interest should be avoided. This paper provides a theoretical thinking and constructs an ethical framework of quadruplet including community, system, government and individuals. The paper also comes up with new ideas about the existing puzzles in administrative ethics.

AB This article examines the attitude adopted by Russian government officials and diplomats toward the Iranian constitutional movement in 1907-1912. Framed by the discourse of international prestige, it was shaped by fundamental factors such as foreign policy and domestic security concerns, imperialism, and orientalism. Of no less importance was the role of Russian diplomats in Iran. They had developed and sustained a wide network of political clients who were supposed to act as agents of Russian influence in the country, ranging from local chieftains to members of the ruling dynasty. At some point, the commitment of numerous Russian consular officers in Iran to their clients outweighed pragmatism, and instead of building relationships with the revolutionary government, they began lobbying for Russia's military intervention in support of counterrevolutionary forces. Depending on information coming from the field officers in Iran and obsessed with the notion of imperial prestige and contempt for revolution, the Russian government eventually gave in to this pressure.

AB This article examines the responsiveness of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to contacts initiated by members of Congress, interest groups, and private citizens. I develop and test hypotheses regarding the importance of internal bureaucratic factors (e.g., workload) and external political forces (e.g., contactor characteristics). Although previous research, which focuses on urban service bureaucracies, indicates that procedurally neutral rules related to agency missions are the primary predictors of responsiveness, I demonstrate that political considerations exerted substantial influence over HCFA responsiveness. For example, the agency was in some ways more responsive to congressional contacts than to contacts initiated by groups and citizens. These results suggest that scholars of legislative-executive relations should pay more attention to contacts as these routine, ongoing encounters may affect the extent to which bureaucratic policy choices are consistent with the preferences of elected officials and their constituents.

AB Introduction Subnational, supralocal (or "regional") approaches to tobacco control are often central federal nation tobacco control and can be superfluous for very small nations. However, their relevance to countries with weak intermediate tiers of governance are less clear. This study explores expert and policymaker perceptions on the function, form, footprint, and funding of regional tobacco control (RTC) in England. Aims and Methods One-to-one semistructured interviews (n = 16) and four focus groups (n = 26) exploring knowledge and perceptions of the past, present, and future of RTC in England were conducted with public health leaders, clinicians, tobacco control practitioners, civil servants, and politicians. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically. Results Participants reported several key functions for RTC, including illicit tobacco control, media campaigns, advocacy, policy development, and network facilitation for local actors. A small minority of participants reported little role for RTC. Broader perceived features of effective RTC included subject expertise, strong regional ties, systems leadership, and a distinctive program of work. Views varied on whether regional programs should be developed nationally or locally, and their optimal footprint. Participants generally agreed stable funding was a prerequisite for success, although there was lesser agreement on funding sources. Conclusions Pooling resources at the regional level in countries with weak intermediate tiers of governance may increase reach, cost-effectiveness and impact of campaigns, policy interventions, and advocacy, whilst retaining the ability to tailor approaches to regional populations. Implications There are likely to be greater funding and governance challenges associated with introducing or strengthening RTC in countries with weak intermediate tiers of governance. Despite this, evidence from England shows it is possible to develop RTC approaches reported as effective by key stakeholders. Possible benefits of regional approaches in this context include cost-effective delivery of illicit tobacco control, media campaigns, advocacy, research, policy development, and coordinated support for local action on tobacco.

AB Background Evidence-based decision-making is crucial to leadership in the health sector to identify country-level priorities and generate solutions supported by rigorous research. Barriers and enablers have been explored, but limited evidence about what works to strengthening capacity at individual and institutional levels within countries has been reported, and inconsistent use of evidence to inform policy-making is a persistent challenge and concern. Methods We conducted a framework analysis comparing experiences of nine purposively selected countries (Chile, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa and Sri Lanka). We utilised qualitative case studies developed by in-country teams to explore enablers and barriers described across components of a predefined theory of change and then identified six cross-cutting themes and recommendations for relevant stakeholders associated with each theme. Results The cross-cutting themes included (1) leadership and political will, (2) incentives and resources, (3) infrastructure and access to health data, (4) designated structures and processes, (5) interaction and relationships, and (6) capacity strengthening and engagement. While each case country's context and experience was different, common enablers and barriers surfaced across each of these themes, with Ministries of Health and other government agencies having strong roles to play, but also recognising the need for other stakeholders, including researchers, donors and civil society, to serve as essential collaborators in order to strengthen evidence uptake. Substantial and sustained investment in research capacities, able leaders and stronger engagement of civil servants are needed to further this progress and strengthen processes of health decision-making. Conclusions All countries represented in this study have made commendable progress in increasing evidence uptake and strengthening supportive systems. Establishing and strengthening necessary structures and the relationships that underpin them takes time as well as resources. Going forward, the findings from this study can help guide and support advocacy to increase domestic funding for health research, especially health policy and systems research, and ensure that civil servants as well as researchers have the capacity and support to collaborate and continue to bolster evidence uptake.

ID FISCAL ILLUSION; ECONOMY
AB Recent empirical literature has shown that the determination of intergovernmental grants is highly influenced by the political bargaining power of the recipient states. In these models federal politicians are assumed to buy the support of state voters, state politicians and state interest groups by providing grants. In this paper we provide evidence that the fiscal referendum reduces the reliance of states on matching grants received from the central government and thus the possibility of interest groups and state bureaucrats to obtain more grants. If referendums are available, voters serve as a hard budget constraint.

AB Do authoritarian governments' responses towards different civil society organizations (CSOs) reflect policy differentiations? Building on the existing literature of graduated control, diversification of civil society, and consultative authoritarianism, this paper utilizes an online field experiment,(1) and interviews with government officials and CSO leaders to demonstrate that local governments have the tendencies to intentionally treat different CSOs with different policy responses, referred to as "deliberate differentiation" in this paper. However, contrary to what the existing literature would suggest, this study reveals that at the local level, such differentiation is driven more by the state's interest in extracting productivity and outsourcing responsibility for the provision of public goods and less by the state's need to acquire information from CSOs, including politically sensitive advocacy groups.

AB We focus on the European Quarter in Brussels as a political place and the spatial context of European Union (EU) policy making. In addition to the EU institutions, the political place consists of a political agglomeration of various kinds of actors, from EU bureaucrats and politicians to a variety of stakeholders and lobbyists from all over the EU, who are permanently present in the Brussels neighbourhood. We present, firstly, the EU Quarter as a fixed setting for policy making with a relatively constant physical, locational and functional shape, and a specific sense of place as the EU bubble. Secondly, we emphasise the fragmentation and fluidity that portray it as a place divided into various political assemblages that make the place an assemblage of assemblages consisting of smaller and constantly evolving sub-processes. Thirdly, we aim to demonstrate the mobile and geographically distributed nature of EU policy making, and thus the dispersal of the political places where it takes place. This generates mobility of different kinds, which include not only the circulation of political ideas and people between different sites of the EU political system, but also the monthly migration of the Parliament and related lobbyists to Strasbourg. We believe that these three aspects of political place help the understanding of the situated but simultaneously spatially dispersed and mobile nature of EU policy making, and the study of the political places in other urban contexts.

AB We develop a theory that considers important differences in competition in the political arena based on whether firms are attempting to maintain or alter the status quo. Particularly, we argue that although investing resources and time to build relationships with politicians and government officials fosters trust, solidarity, and reciprocity, likely producing desired outcomes for both firms attempting to maintain the status quo and those trying to alter it, such relationships are more strongly positive for firms maintaining the status quo. As the effectiveness of relational strategies may differ based on firms' political strategies and firm characteristics, we then theorize that the effects of a more relational approach on "winning" these desired outcomes for firms seeking to maintain or alter the status quo will bemoderated by (1) prior targeting in the political arena where the competition unfolds and (2) a firm's social reputation. Specifically, we argue that knowledge and relationships from prior targeting in a political domain where competition unfolds, and a firm's better social reputation will strengthen the effect of a more relational approach on securing desired outcomes for both firms seeking to maintain and alter the status quo. We expect the moderating effect for a firm's targeting and social reputation will be stronger for firms seeking to maintain the status quo compared with firms seeking to alter the status quo. Our study contributes to corporate political activity literature and notably to the research on political markets by advancing a more nuanced but realistic understanding of interfirm rivalry for governmental outcomes.

Competing demands have grown in the face of perennial water shortages, a situation which has been exacerbated by drought conditions in the past decade. This paper describes the strategy development process recently undertaken in South Khorasan, Iran, in which the inclusion of stakeholder views was central to the approach. It involved government officials and various public and private sector interest groups. Particular efforts were made to involve well irrigators, who are likely to be heavily impacted by changes required to reduce groundwater pumping to a sustainable level. The paper concludes with a discussion of lessons learned.

AB Urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions depend on governments implementing and enforcing rigorous climate policy. Individuals in democracies seeking to persuade government officials to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can take steps such as voting, protesting, and contacting officials directly, but it is unclear how effective each of these actions is in changing the behavior of elected officials. Here we take advantage of the public nature of social media to evaluate the actual efficacy of climate campaign emails using an original, real-world experiment where 335 Members of Canadian Parliament were asked by constituents to post a pro-climate message to their Twitter account. Only one Member of Parliament posted the exact text suggested by the campaign. After scraping and coding 18,776 tweets, we first find no evidence that a public health messaging frame is more effective than a standard environmental frame in eliciting pro-climate posts. Furthermore, we find only a marginally significant relationship between volume of constituent contact and increased pro-climate tweeting from Members of Parliament. Follow-up interviews with political staffers suggest that analog alternatives may be more effective than campaign emails in some cases. Interview findings also reveal that some offices receive low levels of constituent communication on climate change, indicating that increased pressure from constituents could still be consequential.

AB Henry Manne had little to say about environmental law and policy. Yet he had a significant impact on the approach that others took to those topics. These indirect influences on environmental law and policy were threefold. His creation at George Mason University of a highly successful, specialized, law school curriculum demonstrated that law schools could not only survive, but thrive with a subject-matter or methodological focus. His central role in introducing economics to the law school curriculum had a significant and lasting impact on legal education in general and environmental law in particular. And his study and advocacy of markets as effective institutions for the allocation of scarce resources has contributed to the development of environmental law and policy, notwithstanding a predisposition among environmentalists and government officials for a command and control approach.

AB Graduated control models are often used to explain the variety of government treatment of social organizations in China. These models have been slowly losing their explanatory power in recent years, with advocacy-oriented grass-roots groups participating in the policymaking process. Why are these social groups not regulated in the way the graduated control models predict? Based on an analysis of three recent policy advocacy cases, this article proposes a graduated control 2.0 model to explain the new dynamics in Chinese state-society interactions. The upgraded model argues that the government officials' behaviour patterns are influenced by numerous factors such as the inherent nature of social groups highlighted by graduated control models, and inter-ministerial competition - the power position of the state sector and its rival sector in the bureaucratic system. Some contingent factors also play a part, such as timing and the NGO's onstage performance. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion on Chinese state-society relations by developing a theoretical model that highlights both the fragmentation and reactiveness of state control over social groups and further unpacks the 'monolithic state' in China studies.

AB This paper is written as a briefing document with the aim of providing support to policy-makers and government officials tackling obesity and related non-communicable diseases. It is based on a symposium Obesity and non-communicable diseases: Learning from international experiences(1) convened by the International Association for the Study of Obesity (now the World Obesity Federation) and its policy section, the International Obesity TaskForce (now World Obesity - Policy and Prevention). The symposium discussed a wide range of proposals to tackle the consumption of unhealthy food products, including interventions in the market through fiscal policies and marketing restrictions, measures to strengthen public health legislation and measures to limit agri-food company lobbying activities. It recognized the need for government leadership and action in order to reduce preventable deaths while improving economic performance and identified a need for governments to take a systems wide approach to tackling obesity and to work with civil society, especially to monitor the drivers of disease and to hold all stakeholders accountable for progress.

AB The rights and social security of rural migrant workers have been addressed in China in recent years as a result of the work of government departments, international agencies and civil society organisations. This case study of the Social Support Network for Rural Migrant Workers in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, explores one such initiative, in a context in which civil society must operate within the framework of explicit political authorisation and official guidance. The case discusses how well-placed civil society actors were able to create a space for migrant workers' concerns, which included private sector service providers and the media as well as local government officials. Channels for communication, consultation and advocacy around migrant workers' rights have catalysed some important gains in the regime of service delivery for rural migrant workers.

AB City governments in sub-Saharan Africa have historically been beholden to national governments. Lack of national urban policies and tensions between national and city governments are common. Yet, for decades, research has identified small-scale innovations at the urban scale. Rarely, however, are policy innovations in African cities so influential as to lead national governments to scale up city based actions. This is particularly true in sectors that have been the dominant purview of central governments. This paper examines how citizens, civil society organizations, city governments and national bureaucrats in two cities of East Africa - Kampala and Nairobi - have interacted to produce policy innovation in agriculture. Agriculture has always been a sector of high national importance in Africa, but increasingly cities are becoming focal points for agricultural policy change. The two cities compared in the paper are unusual in having a collection of interests who have been advocating for improved support and recognition of urban food production. Indeed, these cities are rare for having continually promoted the formalization of urban agriculture in local and national policy. While advocacy for urban agriculture is common globally, what is not clear is under what conditions local advocacy produces policy uptake and change. What are the conditions when city-based advocacy deepens the institutionalization of policy support locally and nationally? Drawing from theory and research on policy change and African urban politics and governance, and qualitative data collection in each country, this paper argues that while external, international assistance has helped initiate policy dialogue, domestic civil society organizations and their engagement with local and national bureaucrats are key to policy support at the local and national scales.

AB The federal higher education rulemaking process develops policies that can profoundly affect college students, higher education institutions, and other actors in the higher education policy community. But little has been researched about the influence that different types of actors have on higher education rulemaking. By analyzing interviews with 55 policy and higher education actors as well as reviewing documents, news articles, and websites, this case study examines the involvement and influence of different types of policy actors in higher education rulemaking. This research finds that federal bureaucrats, congressional officials, White House officials, and certain interest groups consistently participate in, and are often influential over the higher education rulemaking process; however, no one category of actor consistently dominates the rulemaking process. Political actors are particularly influential in high-profile rules with easy-to-understand subject matters. In highly technical and less prominent rules, bureaucrats and certain interest groups often exercise greater power. This research illustrates the importance of understanding policy subject matter in determining which actors exercise the most power, and suggests that no single theory of bureaucratic policymaking is consistently correct about the types of actors that tend to control regulatory outcomes.

AB Health impact assessments (HIAs) across the globe may be used by governments and industries to secure approval for unconventional gas extraction developments. HIA is an umbrella term that covers an array of health review and assessment practices, ranging from the very general to quite specific and technical health studies. Our concern in this paper is principally with the specialist end of the HIA continuum and particularly its application to unconventional gas extraction in the UK. We outline the context within which HIAs in unconventional gas extraction may be conducted. We then explain what HIAs may do. HIAs are often commissioned from consultancy companies to assess unconventional gas extraction project risks and benefits and propose mitigation measures. Communities can rarely afford HIAs in the planning process and may consider them biased when commissioned by vested interests. The oil and gas industry uses these techniques for its own ends. Hiring experts, be they specialist consultants, researchers, lobbyists, ex-government officials, or regulators, to influence planning and regulation is a well-tried tactic and structural advantage exploited by industry in seeking license to operate. Equitable and ethical HIA principles are urgently needed in the UK in relation to unconventional gas to secure the integrity and probity of the emerging regulatory system and address concerns regarding unregulated practitioners.

AB While a consensus seems to be emerging that bureaucracies of international organizations are of growing relevance for policy-making beyond the nation-state, we still do not systematically understand if and how exactly international bureaucracies seek to influence policy. Most importantly, there is a lack of concepts for a comparative assessment of bureaucratic influence across different International Organizations. This article addresses this shortcoming by offering a conceptualization of administrative styles. Depending on dominant strategic orientations shaping administrative routines, we identify four ideal types: a servant style, an advocacy style, a consolidator style, and an entrepreneurial style. We argue that the variation in administrative styles across different organizations can be explained by two factors, namely the internal and external challenges they face. The concept and theoretical explanation are illustrated in four case studies on the bureaucracies of the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International Settlements, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Labor Organization.

AB Policy entrepreneurs are individuals who exploit an opportunity in order to influence political results for their own benefit. We use the policy entrepreneurship literature as a theoretical lens for understanding how local players in the policy arena can use a national security agenda in order to promote an energy policy they desire. Using a case study approach, we explain how an Israeli electric vehicle company, Better Place, identified Israel's acute national security priority to cut its dependence on oil and leveraged it, along with environmental arguments, to make the case for their approach to transportation. Our analysis also demonstrates how policy entrepreneurs collaborate with Israeli bureaucrats, senior politicians and lobbying groups to create a national shift toward electric cars.

LA English
DT Article
AB Problem To investigate whether and how faculty members in a department of medicine are engaged in public policy activities.
   Approach Between February and April 2011, the authors conducted a cross-sectional, Web-based survey of all active Department of Medicine faculty members at the University of California, San Francisco. Survey questions covered demographics, academic role, academic rank, and participation in three specific public policy activities during the past five years: (1) policy-related research, (2) expert advice to government officials, and (3) public policy advocacy in collaboration with organizations outside government.
   Outcomes Two hundred twenty of 553 faculty (40%) responded to the survey. One hundred twenty-four faculty members (56% of respondents and 22% of total active faculty) reported that they were engaged in at least one of the three types of policy-related activities: 51 (23%) conducted policy-related research, 67 (30%) provided expert advice to government officials, and 93 (42%) collaborated with organizations to advocate for public policy. Higher faculty rank was significantly associated with faculty members reporting that they were involved in one or more of the three policy activities (P = .04).
   Next Steps Academic departments should identify public policy expertise among their faculty and leverage this expertise by facilitating opportunities to develop a shared faculty awareness of their public policy activities, by supporting the establishment of mentoring relationships for less experienced faculty in the area of public policy, and by incorporating standards of excellence for work in public policy into the promotions process.

AB Politicians react to administrative policy making by developing systems of oversight. Existing studies largely emphasize the advantages of reactive oversight, where politicians wait for interest groups to pull a fire alarm on noncompliant activity. Less attention has been paid to proactive oversight, where politicians police administrators directly. To evaluate the effectiveness of police patrol oversight, I look to the White House, which has been policing regulatory proposals since the Nixon administration. I show how policing, or regulatory review, has made agencies more responsive to the president, both by singling out noncompliant proposals and, critically, by shaping agency behavior in anticipation of review. My findings suggest that police patrol oversight is more efficient than previously acknowledged, notably because the associated deterrence effects yield low-cost compliance. I conclude with a discussion of why Congress, despite having similar incentives to control administrators, has not adopted a parallel system of policing.

   INTELLIGENCE FOR PROFIT
SO UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; GOVERNMENT; RETURNS; ETHICS; LAW
AB Government officials have recently been scrutinized for using information acquired in the performance of their official duties to gain market-trading advantages. Lobbyists have similarly been criticized for collecting material non-public political information from Capitol Hill contacts and selling it to their clients notably hedge funds who presumably use the information in their market transactions. Is this insider trading? Most likely not. Should it be? A few members of Congress have responded by introducing legislation in the past three Congresses that would bring trading on this "political intelligence," by government insiders and outsiders, under the umbrella of the federal securities laws. Unsurprisingly, the legislation has failed to garner significant political support. But a renewed fervor for "cleaning up" Washington ushered in by the Obama Administration, coupled with the current economic crisis, has reinvigorated the campaign. The legislation was reintroduced and received a hearing in 2009. In addition, recent academic scholarship is now calling for the passage of this legislation in order to bring trading on political intelligence under the federal insider trading regime.
   This Comment takes issue with the insider trading approach. It argues that the federal securities laws are an inappropriate and ineffective legal mechanism for remedying issues of political ethics. First, as it pertains to governmerit insiders, this Comment recommends an ethics approach, such as mandatory blind trusts, to deal with financial conflicts of interest. Second, with gard to outside actors, such as lobbyists and hedge funds, it argues for public disclosure of political-intelligence gathering activities. This Comment argues against prohibiting trading on political intelligence by outside actors because these actors are merely the Washington equivalents of market analysts, whose information gathering functions are perfectly legitimate, if not desirable. Lastly, this Comment warns that insider trading regulation of political intelligence would have two distinct chilling effects: one on democratic process, by hampering dialogue between lawmakers and constituents, and another on market efficiency, by discouraging valuable information gathering.

AB Scholarship on bureaucratic policymaking has long focused on both the use of expertise and public accountability. However, few have considered the degree to which public input affects the use of research in U.S. regulatory impact analyses (RIAs). We examine changes in the research that is cited in RIAs in response to public comments to assess the influence of participation on the use of information for rulemaking. We conduct an in-depth analysis of comments on a major proposed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule to determine whether regulators alter the evidence used based on public input and whether some types of commenters have more influence than others. We analyze the text similarity of comments to scientific research utilized in the RIAs to determine whether regulators iteratively update their rule justification based on scientific information referenced in comments. We find support for seminal subgovernment theories about the relationship between business interests, Congress, and the bureaucracy; in relation to all kinds of commenters, members of Congress and industry groups had the strongest effect on changes in the research used in the RIAs. The article provides one of the first statistical analyses of science exchange between the public and a bureaucratic agency.

AB Motivation Little is known about how partnerships between the state and civil society organizations (CSOs) to deliver services as part of counter-terrorism measures (CTMs) work in practice; nor how CSOs make sense of such partnerships and their implications.
   Purpose This article examines patterns in partnerships between the state and CSOs to deliver services. It investigates how CSOs perceive this partnership and the socio-political and policy implications.
   Approach and Methods Faith-based, youth/children CSOs, women's and human rights groups engaged in capacity building, technical assistance and advocacy in counter-terrorism operations in northeast Nigeria were studied. A mixed-method design was adopted to examine the experiences and perspectives of CSO managers and field staff, as well as the views of government officials, including security agents involved in counter-terrorism.
   Findings The state contracted the CSOs to deliver services, but not to engage in political advocacy. Thus, the state controlled the political realm and influenced the non-political arena. CSOs believed that the service-delivery partnership impinged on their organizational principles and capacity to demand government accountability and transparency.
   Policy implications CSOs should be engaged as vital and equal partners in addressing security issues. Excluding advocacy-oriented CSOs from security measures is counter-productive. It potentially silences public demands for transparency, accountability and justice, thereby entrenching insecurity and impinging on humanitarian interventions. Restricting CSOs to service delivery undercuts their ability to connect government and society.

   of the UK Low-Risk Drinking Guidelines
SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH RESPONSIBILITY DEAL; PUBLIC-HEALTH; POLICY; TOBACCO; ACTORS
AB Objective: In 2016, the U.K. Chief Medical Officers published revised low-risk drinking guidelines, based on an updated evidence review. These guidelines advised that men and women drink no more than 14 units per week a reduction for men-while emphasizing the dangers of drinking in pregnancy and as a risk factor for cancer. The aim of this study is to examine how the alcohol industry responded to the publication of the guidelines. Method: This article draws on 26 semi-structured interviews with civil servants, parliamentarians, and public health and civil society actors. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed. anonymized, and analyzed using thematic coding. Results: Following the publication of the new draft guidelines, the U.K. alcohol industry criticized their exclusion from the guidelines development process. They then mounted a major public relations campaign that strongly criticized the guidance produced and rejected the association of drinking with cancer without recourse to evidence. The Portman Group, which was prominent in the industry response, did not recommend that members or other companies carry the revised content on product labels and sought to undermine them via high-level political lobbying. There was no formal campaign to communicate the guidelines to the public. Conclusions: The present case adds new insights into the political strategies of alcohol industry actors to undermine public health, providing evidence of confrontational tactics. It draws attention to the failure of self-regulatory regimes to incorporate basic public health messaging.

TI Remnants of Empire: Tracing Norway's F-35 Decision
SO CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB What is left of the 'empire by invitation'? Coined by Geir Lundestad in 1986, the seemingly contradictory phrase has been used to explain the nature of American power in Western Europe and beyond. This article revisits the concept to shed light on Norway's 2008 decision to recapitalize its fighter jet fleet with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter -an event of considerable political significance in the ongoing history of this complex, controversial, and geopolitically consequential weapons programme. Using multiple sources, including diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, the article traces how Americans and their local brokers intervened in the Norwegian policy process to ensure that the F-35s would go to the Royal Norwegian Air Force. In addition to suggesting that 'empire by invitation' remains a fact of international political life, the analysis also shows the importance of legitimation strategies in security policy. This especially applies to the study of international arms deals because interactions between and among politicians, diplomats, bureaucrats, and lobbyists always involve claims and counterclaims about legitimate national interest.

AB In the wake of mass-migrations of refugees seeking safety and stability in Europe, this contribution studies emerging grassroots organizations that support refugee status holders in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The municipality expects these organizations to adhere to the European trend to incorporate immigrant integration priorities in interventions that apply to all residents. The article discusses the paradox of how bureaucratic classifications regarding preferred target groups cast certain grassroots responses as fringe-activities that are less legible bureaucratically. Based on a year of ethnographic fieldwork, this article shows how this lessened legibility translates into profound insecurities for grassroots organizers. The article discusses how these insecurities, in combination with the uncertainty grassroots organizers feel regarding their employability, motivate them to play guessing games and to give in to municipal preferences to boost their eligibility for funding. It argues that this process of giving in to municipal preferences should be understood as an attempt to render their endeavors legible, reduce precariousness, secure a livelihood, and turn affective labor into a life-sustaining practice. In so doing, this contribution evokes the story of a particular grassroots organizer-a woman of color with a forced migration background.

ID LEAGUE-OF-NATIONS; WAR
AB The Locarno Conference, held on 5-16 October 1925, represented the culmination of nearly two years of diplomatic communication between the foreign offices of Germany, Britain, and France. The conference was an attempt to normalize relations between the former Allied powers and Germany's new Weimar Republic and more tightly bind Germany's politics and economy to Western Europe. Colonial German lobbies hoped that the Locarno talks heralded the return of empire and an end to Germany's banishment from the work of the 'civilizing mission' and the humiliating experience of being a 'postcolonial state in a still colonial world'. Public scrutiny from false press reports about the restoration of the German colonies emanating from Germany, France, Britain and its colonies and dominions, and even the United States complicated matters for Locarno delegates by forcing discussion of off-agenda topics. This article interrogates how the Colonial German lobby influenced the Locarno Conference through activity in the international public sphere, how they managed a partial victory in the wake of Locarno, and more importantly, the Colonial German lobby learned new and better strategies for playing properly to public opinion and international bureaucracies.

AB There is a positive correlation between recall of tobacco-related television news and perceived risks of smoking and thoughts about quitting. The authors used Cision US, Inc., to create a sampling frame (N=61,027) of local and national television news coverage of tobacco from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2009, and to draw a nationally representative sample (N=730) for content analysis. The authors conducted a descriptive study to determine the frequency and proportion of stories containing specified tobacco topics, frames, sources, and action messages, and the valence of the coverage. Valence was generally neutral; 68% of stories took a balanced stance, with 26% having a tenor supportive of tobacco control and 6% opposing tobacco control. The most frequently covered topics included smoking bans (n=195) and cessation (n=156). The least covered topics included hookah (n=1) and menthol (n=0). The majority of coverage lacked quoting any source (n=345); government officials (n=144) were the most quoted sources. Coverage lacked action messages or resources; 29 stories (<4%) included a message about cessation or advocacy, and 8 stories (1%) contained a resource such as a quitline. Television news can be leveraged by health communication professionals to increase awareness of underrepresented topics in tobacco control.

AB In 2000, more than 60 nonprofit agencies, health care providers, government officials, and community advocates in Tarrant County, Texas, came together to work for systemic change in the mental health care system. The coalition, known as the Mental Health Connection, began working toward a "No Wrong Door" approach to mental health services, which required aggressive coordination between federal, private, and nonprofit resources. The result is a five- to six-year plan for implementation of a new systems of care model for children with severe emotional disturbances and their families. The Mental Health Connection also focuses on legislative advocacy to bring about necessary policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels. Finally, the coalition focuses on developing sustainable revenue streams that will allow the new systems to remain in place once the group accomplishes the initial mission of the Mental Health Connection.

DT Article
ID POLITICAL-PARTICIPATION; GEZI PARK; DEMOCRACY
AB This article discusses two recent cases of environmental civic participation in Georgia involving resistance to development projects and the attempts to protect public space in the capital city of Tbilisi-the cases of Vake Park and "Panorama Tbilisi." Despite their distinct lifecycles and levels of policy success, the two cases illustrate the same challenges to environmental civic participation in Georgia. The top-down challenge derives from government officials' reluctance to involve outside actors in environmental policymaking and their strategy of labeling environmental activists as politically biased and controlled by the officials' political opponents. The bottom-up challenge derives from environmental activists' limited policy advocacy capacities, in terms of both strategic diversity and evidence-based argumentation. These two challenges, reinforced by a cultural context of civic participation characterized by social nihilism, work together to encourage the exclusion of activists from environmental policymaking.

DE Contract law; Harmonisation; Law reform
ID INDUSTRY
AB Contract law harmonization in the European Union has met with some significant but limited success. This Essay explores some of the psychological and political forces that can complicate or even hinder law reform efforts. Even when there is a general institutional drive for law reform, as there is in the EU, scarce reform resources force attention to be focused on salient issues, while a status quo bias in individual member states by government officials can provide a braking inertia regarding nonsalient legal reforms. This braking influence can be seized upon and enhanced by interest groups that oppose reforms, especially where there is an alternative to proposed law reforms for private entities. In the case of contract law harmonization, contract doctrine that is not focused on providing consumer protections remain nonsalient, commercial entities can solve the confusion of diverse laws by choosing their own, and interest groups in nations whose laws and dispute resolution forums are commonly chosen will oppose harmonization. Thus, the current state of affairs may prove relatively difficult to alter.

   INFORMATION; OVERSIGHT; POLITICS; DELAY
AB Anecdotal evidence of agencies burying bad news is rife in law and politics. The bureaucracy regularly is accused of announcing controversial policies on holidays and weekends when public attention is elsewhere. We show that this conventional wisdom is wrong, or at least significantly incomplete. The conventional wisdom is riddled with theoretical holes, and there is little systematic empirical evidence to support it. After critiquing the conventional account of agencies hiding bad news, we articulate and defend a revised theory of strategic timing in administrative law. We argue that timing decisions rarely affect the visibility of decisions but can drive up the costs of monitoring and responding for interest groups and legislative coalitions. Agency discretion to choose when to announce policy decisions can even allow agencies to influence which interest groups monitor the regulatory process and therefore whose preferences must be taken into account. We evaluate both the conventional wisdom and our revised theory using twenty-five years of empirical evidence. We then develop the implications for administrative law doctrine and institutional design of the bureaucracy.

DE Older adults; older adult programs; aging policies
ID POLITICS; POLICY
AB In his surprise election as president, Donald Trump enjoyed disproportionate electoral support from older voters, many of whom saw in Trump a person who would work to reverse demographic, economic, and cultural forces that had transformed American life as they had long seen it. Yet, Trump's campaign and incumbency has also been very much about gutting the Washington policy establishment of officials, bureaucrats, and lobbyists (aka, the swamp) which, for more than half a century, has been instrumental in enacting and expanding legislation that has benefitted older Americans far more than any other social policy constituency in the country. This article contrasts the value-oriented electoral support Trump enjoyed from older Americans with their interest concerns centered on policies such as the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and a host of smaller grant-in-aid programs. It then reviews the strong institutional base seniors and their advocates have in Washington, posing whether interest-oriented concerns may outweigh ideological ones as policy options emerge from a Republican-controlled government prior to the 2018 elections.

AB Purpose of Review Many "validated" treatment outcome assessments in clinical trials fail to include outcomes important to patients. This review will focus on recent efforts to revise and make patient-centric clinical trial outcomes used in psoriasis, acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa.
   Recent Findings Over recent years, international coalitions have been formed to revise the investigator-oriented "validated" measures (e. g., PASI, IGA) in order to incorporate outcomes important to patients These not only include quality of life (QoL) assessments but also the anatomic location, physical discomfort, and appearance. This review discusses work underway to include patients in formatting revised outcome assessments.
   Summary Historically, outcome measures have been developed by clinicians and pharmaceutical companies for use in clinical trials. Nonetheless, a movement is underway supported by regulatory agencies, government officials, and patient advocacy groups to include patients in the process of redesigning clinical trial outcome measures.

AB Objective: Despite broad agreement on the need for comprehensive policy action to improve the healthiness of food environments, implementation of recommended policies has been slow and fragmented. Benchmarking is increasingly being used to strengthen accountability for action. However, there have been few evaluations of benchmarking and accountability initiatives to understand their contribution to policy change. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) Australia initiative (2016-2020) that assessed Australian governments on their progress in implementing recommended policies for improving food environments. Design: A convergent mixed methods approach was employed incorporating data from online surveys (conducted in 2017 and 2020) and in-depth semi-structured interviews (conducted in 2020). Data were analysed against a pre-defined logic model. Setting: Australia. Participants: Interviews: twenty stakeholders (sixteen government, four non-government). Online surveys: fifty-three non-government stakeholders (52 % response rate) in 2017; thirty-four non-government stakeholders (36 % response rate) in 2020. Results: The Food-EPI process involved extensive engagement with government officials and the broader public health community across Australia. Food-EPI Australia was found to support policy processes, including as a tool to increase knowledge of good practice, as a process for collaboration and as an authoritative reference to support policy decisions and advocacy strategies. Conclusions: Key stakeholders involved in the Food-EPI Australia process viewed it as a valuable initiative that should be repeated to maximise its value as an accountability mechanism. The highly collaborative nature of the initiative was seen as a key strength that could inform design of other benchmarking processes.

AB There is a growing recognition of the role of meso-level institutions that operate between the central state and communities in facilitating climate change adaptation at local and district levels. This article explores how collaborative approaches to planned adaptation by an external agent in Ghana can create linkages between meso-level institutions and communities, and examines how the actors involved have received the approach. The study is based on fieldwork in the Northern and Upper East regions of Ghana. The programme examined has been designed to reflect the need of each community instead of general adaptation strategies. Findings from the study suggest that the communities involved have achieved positive outcomes from the approach. Capacity building and advocacy training have made the involved communities more proactive, which has increased the collaboration between the communities and local governance. Climate change adaptation has now become one of the key priorities on the political agenda of the local district assemblies. However, lack of funding hinders the achievements to be expanded to the rest of the district. More funding, therefore, needs to be directed at meso-level institutions to increase adaptation.

AB Are international courts power-seeking by nature, expanding the reach and scope of international rules and the courts' authority where permissive conditions allow? does expansionist lawmaking require special nurturing? We investigate the relative influences of nature versus nurture by comparing expansionist lawmaking in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the Andean Tribunal of Justice (ATJ), the ECJ's jurisdictional cousin and the third most active international court. We argue that international judges are more likely to become expansionist lawmakers where they are supported by substate interlocutors and compliance constituencies, including government officials, advocacy networks, national judges, and administrative agencies. This comparison of two structurally identical international courts calls into question prevailing explanations of ECJ lawmaking, and it suggests that prevailing scholarship puts too much emphasis on the self-interested power-seeking of judges, the importance of institutional design features, and the preferences of governments to explain lawmaking by international courts.

DE interfaith; Census; religion question; campaign; Muslim Council of

AB The campaign from 1996-2000 to include the religion question in the 2001 Census for England and Wales was a defining event for Muslim communities in Britain because it provided formal recognition of their collective identity as a faith group, rather than being subsumed in the 'black', 'Asian' or 'Pakistani/Bangladeshi' ethnic categorisations of the past. A 'micro-history' of this four-year journey deserves to be put on the record, and this account provides a perspective from the point of view of one community advocacy body that had an active involvement, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). The account also draws on documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the government department responsible for the Census. It describes the emergence of an interfaith alliance as a political pressure group and the civil servants' responses when faced with demands for change. A major social policy decision was eventually taken, not just through a process of rational negotiation, but through fortuitous and unscripted interventions of persons of goodwill. The campaign offered British Muslims their first comprehensive engagement with the variety of formal and informal networks, centres of power, institutions and processes that interact in the shaping of policy in a participative democracy.

TI Ethics and the Profession: The Crystallizing of Public Relations
   Practice from Association to Accreditation, 1936-1964
SO AMERICAN JOURNALISM
LA English
DT Article
AB Scholars consider the development of public relations ethics to be an integral component in professionalizing public relations. If this connection exists, the solidifying of the profession that took place from the interwar to postwar periods should provide not only evidence for this linkage, but also insight into a philosophy of public relations practice and its key ethical considerations. This study establishes the bookend years of 1936, which marked the founding of the first professional public relations association, and 1964, which marked the start of Public Relations Society of America's accreditation for practice, as defining moments in establishing a profession. An analysis of speeches from business leaders, government officials, and communication practitioners shed light on practices and ethics. The uneasiness many current scholars and professionals express toward persuasive strategies was largely absent during the formative years, as truthful advocacy via two-way communication became emblematic of public relations practice.

TI The UN Peacebuilding Commission and Gender: A Case of Norm Reinforcement
SO INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years, increasing reference has been made to the issue area of 'women, peace and security', reflecting a set of norms that are gradually becoming institutionalized within the UN. This article explores the validity of such claims through an empirical study of the relatively newly established UN Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) and the extent to which gender language and concerns have been integrated into the latter's founding resolutions and deliberations on peacebuilding strategies. The article suggests that 'women, peace and security' concerns have emerged as a legitimate normative framework in the peacebuilding context. The PBC has served an important role in reinforcing this normative framework. However, the actual inclusion of women in strategic thinking and policy development is still dependent on the lobbying of dedicated norm entrepreneurs among member states, UN bureaucrats and nongovernmental organizations.

AB The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates that all students receive access to the general education curriculum but does not define adequate access. Street-level bureaucracy theory was used to investigate special educators' interpretation of their role and responsibility to create academic access for students with significant cognitive disabilities. In-depth telephone interviews were conducted with elementary, middle, and secondary special educators (n = 33) across one state. Findings revealed that access was ultimately a consistent series of decisions. Participants relied on their ethical beliefs about disability and schooling to make cost benefit decisions, predicting and assigning value to the long-term benefits of academic activities. Researchers and policymakers concerned with academic access should recognize that special educators' implementation of new interventions will likely be filtered through the process of access described. New initiatives and strategies should explicitly illustrate how they increase the benefits and reduce the costs of inclusive academic experiences for students with severe disabilities.

ID INFANT FORMULA PROMOTION; MILK SUBSTITUTES; TRENDS; FRAMEWORK
AB Background The aggressive marketing of breastmilk substitutes (BMS) reduces breastfeeding, and harms child and maternal health globally. Yet forty years after the World Health Assembly adopted the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (The Code), many countries are still to fully implement its provisions into national law. Furthermore, despite The Code, commercial milk formula (CMF) markets have markedly expanded. In this paper, we adopt the Philippines as a case study to understand the battle for national Code implementation. In particular, we investigate the market and political strategies used by the baby food industry to shape the country's 'first-food system', and in doing so, promote and sustain CMF consumption. We further investigate how breastfeeding coalitions and advocates have resisted these strategies, and generated political commitment for a world-leading breastfeeding policy framework and protection law (the 'Milk Code'). We used a case study design and process tracing method, drawing from documentary and interview data. Results The decline in breastfeeding in the Philippines in the mid-twentieth Century associated with intensive BMS marketing via health systems and consumer advertising. As regulations tightened, the industry more aggressively promoted CMFs for older infants and young children, thereby 'marketing around' the Milk Code. It established front groups to implement political strategies intended to weaken the country's breastfeeding policy framework while also fostering a favourable image. This included lobbying government officials and international organizations, emphasising its economic importance and threats to foreign investment and trade, direct litigation against the government, messaging that framed marketing in terms of women's choice and empowerment, and forging partnerships. A resurgence in breastfeeding from the mid-1980s onwards reflected strengthening political commitment for a national breastfeeding policy framework and Milk Code, resulting in-turn, from collective actions by breastfeeding coalitions, advocates and mothers. Conclusion The Philippines illustrates the continuing battle for worldwide Code implementation, and in particular, how the baby food industry uses and adapts its market and political practices to promote and sustain CMF markets. Our results demonstrate that this industry's political practices require much greater scrutiny. Furthermore, that mobilizing breastfeeding coalitions, advocacy groups and mothers is crucial to continually strengthen and protect national breastfeeding policy frameworks and Code implementation.

AB Adaptive management has become increasingly common where natural resource managers face complex and uncertain conditions. The collaboration required among managers and others to do adaptive management, however, is not always easy to achieve. We describe efforts to work with villagers and government officials in Malinau, East Kalimantan Indonesia, where a weak, uncertain institutional setting and complex shifting political landscape made formal cooperation among these groups for forest management problematic. Through successive trials, the team learned instead to work with and enhance a "spontaneous order" of cooperation using four tactics: (1) continuous physical presence, (2) regular contact with the people who advised and were close to major decision makers, (3) maintenance of multiple programs to fit the needs of different interest groups, and (4) hyperflexibility in resource allocation and schedules.

AB Purpose: In recent years, anti-corruption has been continuously strengthened, and various corruptions appear gradually. The purpose of this paper is to find out solutions of reducing anti-corruption costs and enhancing corruption costs so as to reduce corruption phenomena. Methods: the research in this paper, based on rational economic man's assumption, is to study costs and benefits of corruptions among people in government departments and also costs and benefits of China anti-corruption from the perspective of interest groups by building a cost-benefit model and double-person game model. Conclusion: cost-benefit analysis and behavior game indicates that it is the best way to strike corruptions by enhancing corruption costs and reducing anti-corruption costs in face of the problems of corruption among government officials.

AB Background: Limited research has focused on undocumented immigrants' health and access to care.
   Objectives: This paper describes participant engagement strategies used to investigate the health needs of immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
   Methods: Community-based strategies engaged advocates and undocumented Californians in study design and recruitment. Outreach in diverse settings, social media, and participant-driven sampling recruited 61 DACA-eligible focus group participants.
   Lessons Learned: Social media, community-based organizations (CBOs), family members, advocacy groups, and participant:driven sampling were the most successful recruitment strategies. Participants felt engaging in research was instrumental for sharing their concerns with health care providers and policymakers, noteworthy in light of their previously identified fears and mistrust of government officials.
   Conclusions: Using multiple culturally responsive strategies including participant-driven sampling, engagement with CBOs, and use of social media, those eligible for DACA eagerly engage as research participants. Educating researchers and institutional review boards (IRBs) about legal and safety concerns can improve research engagement.

AB Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly utilized and accepted by patients and providers throughout the American health care system. Most accounts attribute this growing acceptability to the shortcomings of conventional medicine, the appeal of CAM's core beliefs, and the growing body of research indicating that CAM actually works. These explanations, while all accurate to some degree, neglect the extent to which CAM's recent success is due to economic and political factors. This article describes the emerging relationship between CAM and major economic actors (pharmaceutical firms, managed care companies, insurance companies, media conglomerates, Internet providers, etc.) as well as CAM's relationship with a range of political forces (political parties, bureaucrats, lobbying groups, ethnic- and gender-based movements and organizations, etc.). The convergence of interests between these economic and political forces and many of CAM's goals is one important reason for CAM's recent success.

ID COMPETITION; ECONOMICS; POLICY; AID; POLITICS; DECISION; FAILURE
AB Under political competition, bureaucrats who wish to maintain their jobs and salaries must continue to stimulate demand for their agency's services in order to secure funding. This paper suggests that one way a bureau can do so is by creating avenues for private entities to collect rents through entrepreneurial action. The Federal Student Aid office in the U.S. Department of Education and their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) can serve as an example. By getting students to fill out a FAFSA application, colleges obtain the detailed financial information of students and families. Colleges can then use this information to price discriminate. The bureau's derived benefits from this behavior are two-fold: (1) Private interests groups can lobby political sponsors to continue funding the agency. Using data obtained from lobbying reports filed with the federal government, we find that there is a positive relationship between lobbying expenditures and the implementation of regulations that enhance the value of the rents associated with the FAFSA. (2) The source of the rents can be used as a performance indicator to meet the demands of political sponsors. Drawing from the 5-year strategic plans from the Department of Education and the Federal Student Aid office, we find that these bureaus can benefit from engaging in such behavior.

AB Decisions over state assistance to firms can hinge on whether politicians choose a strategy that favors particular interest groups, targets aggregate economic performance, or both. Which types of firms are more likely to receive financial help from the government? While standard interest group based explanations tend to see special interests dominating the political process, extraordinary economic challenges, such as financial crises, may make general economic concerns a greater priority for politicians. We argue that during financial crisis, politicians - who are always concerned with the economy - are even more likely to prioritize broad economic growth over helping particular groups. Politicians should favor general economic strategies over helping specific groups of firms because they have limited resources and wish to avoid sending a bad signal to other firms about helping those that fail. Using 2010 World Bank firm-level surveys done in Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Turkey, we find that politicians favored small dynamic firms with a proven ability to use resources well rather than the largest employers, those firms with the greatest lobbying capacity, or firms in particular sectors. We optimistically conclude that interest groups with disproportionate resources will not always get special treatment at the expense of others.

AB This study examines the impact of neoliberal policy-which introduces competition for funding and pressure to professionalize and bureaucratize-on the working conditions and precarity of a purposive sample of southern Ontario (Canada) organizations dealing with LGBTQ + health. Findings from semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 20 community-based organization stakeholders and government bureaucrats confirmed that neoliberal policy pressures these organizations to professionalize and bureaucratize, while restricting political advocacy. Queer Liberation Theory's three central tenets of anti-assimilationism, solidarity across movements, and the political economy of queer health are used to understand the situation and possible futures for third-sector organizations within the LGBTQ + movement.

AB To mitigate degradation of open-access natural resources, government officials and resource users often share responsibilities in monitoring and enforcing management rules. Common pool resource (CPR) theory provides diagnostics for assessing the robustness of such rule arrangements. In this paper, we employ CPR theory to examine co-management efforts involving a government land management agency and a climber advocacy organization in a rock climbing destination in Utah, USA. Based on interviews and site visits, we find variation in perceptions of compliance and moderate accordance with the principles of robust rule design offered by CPR theory. The contributions of this paper are both practical and theoretical. Practically, we identify potential methods for strengthening management strategies for an open-access natural resource. Theoretically, we explore the generalizability of CPR theory to a non-traditional CPR setting, offer precise conceptualization and operationalization of the CPR design principle components, and find elite influence in facilitating communication and collective decision-making in the establishment of management rules.

AB This article examines the hypothesis that interest groups are behind the increasing privatisation of healthcare services in Malaysia. The evidence supports the instrumentalist argument that powerful interest groups seeking profits, rather than real concerns for allocative efficiency, have been the prime drivers of healthcare privatisation in Malaysia . Not only have private healthcare expenditures risen more swiftly than government healthcare expenditure but, from 1982, public funds have also been used to purchase private services from public hospitals However, unlike simple class analyses, class contention manifesting through alliances between politicians, bureaucrats and capitalists has been a major force behind healthcare privatisation in Malaysia. The source of these developments can be traced to power wielded by the government to quicken the creation of a Bumiputera capitalist class that began to gain momentum from the late 1970s.

AB Narrative has become a fashionable concept in the everyday practice and analysis of democratic politics. Politicians, bureaucrats, lobbyists, activists and commentators all talk about the importance of constructing and controlling narratives in democratic debate. Yet astonishingly, the pre-eminent way of thinking about public debate in democratic theory - deliberative democracy - has almost nothing to say about narrative. Drawing on the substantial bodies of literature on narrative in general, and on its relationship to public debate in particular, this article argues that narrative is in fact a crucial aspect of democratic deliberation. In light of the systemic turn' in deliberative theory, which sees deliberation as occurring across a range of differentiated but interconnected spaces, it suggests that narrative is a crucial device by which people talk and think about complex and contested issues. It argues that deliberative democrats must come to terms with narrative because its pervasive influence can affect deliberative systems in important ways. The article outlines these potential impacts - both those that reinforce deliberative ideals and those that conflict with them. It concludes by looking at the broader implications for the practice, theory and study of deliberative democracy.

   DISCRETION
AB Students of politics have identified a variety of actors who appear to influence the federal bureaucracy's implementation of public policy, including Congress, the president, and interest groups. These lines of research, however, have often portrayed interest groups as actors with indirect influence (who, for example, work through or with Congress), rather than assessing the direct influence of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs. I conduct a test of direct interest group influence by analyzing an original data set composed of 1,444 interest group comments in reaction to forty federal agency rules. I find, contrary to the expectations of the extant literature, that the formal participation of interest groups during rulemaking can, and often does, alter the content of policy within the "fourth branch" of government. I conclude that those who voice their preferences during the notice and comment period rulemaking are often able to change government policy outputs to better match their preferences.

AB Does the Norwegian political landscape indicate advocacy of binding international carbon storage commitments in the foreseeable future? Norway's unique geology has understandably prompted a particular interest in the subject. This article analyses the interests and relative influence of the key domestic actors (the oil industry, environmental organizations, political parties and government bureaucracy) who wield influence in policy-making processes concerning carbon dioxide storage. Despite the level of interest aroused by the issue in Norway, the evidence suggests that policy will not move in the direction of an international carbon storage agreement. This is mainly because Norwegian policy-making in the field is dominated by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, whose current interests do not seem compatible with such a position. The fact that carbon storage can be developed in accordance with Norway's interests as a petroleum producer may, however, be a decisive factor for the political parties, government bureaucracy and the oil industry in the future.

ID SCIENCE ADVICE
AB Scientific research and expertise play a critical role in informing legislative decisions and guiding effective policy. However, significant communication gaps persist between scientists and policymakers. While interest in science policy among researchers has substantially increased in recent decades, traditional academic and research careers rarely provide formal training or exposure to the inner workings of government, public policy, or communicating scientific findings to broad audiences. Here, we offer 10 practical steps for scientists who want to engage in science policy efforts, with a focus on state and federal policy in the United States. We first include a primer to government structure and tailoring science communication for a policymaker audience. We then provide action-oriented steps that focus on arranging and successfully navigating meetings with government officials. Finally, we suggest structural steps in academia that would provide resources and support for students, researchers, and faculty who are interested in policy. We offer our perspective, as early-career marine scientists who have participated in policy discussions at state and federal levels and through the American Geophysical Union's "Voices for Science" program. This guide offers potential pathways for engagement in science policy, and provides researchers with tangible actions to effectively reach stakeholders. Lastly, we hope to activate further conversations on best practices for policy engagement, particularly for researchers interested in careers at the science policy interface.

AB Most states have numerous paths to create security for themselves. Foreign policy-makers must recognize that their own security policy will initiate a process that structures the nature of the domestic competition over domestic and foreign policy in other countries. I contend that one state's security alternative can empower or weaken domestic actors and interest groups in opposing foreign powers. I term this process the 'second face of security' since it entails a less direct and more nuanced method of creating security (in contrast to the 'first face of security'). I apply this model to explain the intent of Britain's 'smart' or targeted appeasement policy during the 1930s - to strengthen conservative business, government officials, and economic circles in banking, light industry and finished goods, and even heavy industry in order to steer Tokyo and Berlin away from rearmament and extreme autarky.

SO CHURCH HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent scholarship has argued that Cold War anticommunism was key among the tools with which conservative evangelicals in the United States negotiated their return to the mainstream of American public conversation. While useful, such renderings of the anticommunist leaven in the repoliticization of religious conservatives remain misleading as long as they remain pivoted on the small cadre of reputedly moderate new evangelical intellectuals. Entirely obscured in such portrayals is the agency of the militant separatist fundamentalists whose engagement with anticommunism was at once broader in scope, more systematic, organized and pervasive, and of significantly earlier lineage than that of their new evangelical rivals. The roots of the Christian Right do indeed lie in Cold War Christian anticommunism but the lines of influence stretch as much, if not more, from the fundamentalists gathered around the controversial pastor Carl McIntire and his American ( and International) Council of Christian Churches as they do from the new evangelicals. A pivotal transitional figure who nurtured, renovated, and passed on to a new generation the anticollectivist public doctrines of the original fundamentalist movement. In his anticommunist work McIntire pioneered, as well, the faith-based mass demonstration and petition, the political use of Christian radio, and the lobbying of government officials that the later Christian Right perfected.

The authors discuss issues related to the natural and historic environment, the complexities in English legislation, and the organisational structures which make it difficult to work towards an integrated approach which enhances, protects and conserves both the natural and cultural heritage. These complexities are looked at through the 2018 revision of the National Planning Policy Framework, the introduction of the Environment Bill and the Net Gain concept. The authors suggest that working coordination and cooperation across the sectors may result in more effective lobbying and more substantive improvements.

AB While research on legal mobilization shows how social movements contribute to the definition and implementation of rights, it remains excessively centered on litigation to the detriment of administrative rights enforcement. This article maps out how street-level bureaucracies impact rights enforcement by distinguishing between allocation, access, and process, and analyzes how social movements intervene in these three aspects. It then focuses on allocation, using the case of French disability policy to analyze the forms of advocacy deployed by movement actors who take part in the rights allocation process at the local level. The article argues that conformity to institutional norms derives not so much from a pressure to conform as from the knowledge and experience of the limited means locally available to make rights effective. Further, it shows how advocacy is reframed from the defense of individual claims to a role of scrutiny and control of the bureaucratic allocation of rights.

SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Political power; Forest owners associations; Forestry; Forest policy
ID POLICY; PARTICIPATION; GOVERNANCE
AB The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential of forest owners associations (FOAs) to influence forest policymaking using power theory. Firstly, the paper examines the concept of power and the political power of interest groups. Interest groups seek to be able to use their power through Influencing policy outcomes and framing the underlying dimensions that define policy issues. In the next step the paper defines factors of dispositional political power: formal, informal, internal, and external. Formal factors are primarily based constitutionally or legislatively and are ensured through the right to associate and form associations to advocate common interests. Informal factors represent the abilities of interest groups to operate in the political process. Internal factors represent the ability of interest groups to work within the group and external factors represent the behaviour towards other associations, government, non-governmental organisations, etc. Semi-structured questionnaires to former and present FOAs officials were used containing questions about the basic role of FOAs as they can be found in the scientific literature. The crucial internal factor limiting the dispositional power of FOAs is the lack of financial resources for providing services or necessary apparatus, which might strongly hinder the fulfilment and achievement of set goals in policymaking. The disinterest of the state bureaucracy towards non-state forests also limits FOAs' dispositional power. The most important external factor from the officials' perspective is the disinterest of the state bureaucracy towards non-state forests at the sectoral and cross-sectoral level. There is a common agreement between FOA officials that current strategies and tactics in the form of dialogue are inefficient. FOAs are considered as a partner in policy formulation, but their actual political power is low, due to the disunity among FOA leaders and ineffective strategies and tactics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   Pilot Project (OPP); low-cost sanitation; Pakistan
ID NGOS
AB Community participation remains central to development policy; but so do concerns that negotiations to achieve it have become a drill devoid of real meaning. Repeatedly, development interventions fail to unlock its presumed benefits: low-cost innovation, good governance and sustainability. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) in Pakistan, a well-known case of organic community participation, this article demonstrates that the ability to buy consent in the case of donor-funded projects erodes the capacity for real community negotiations to take place. The article argues for closer study of cases such as OPP, known for their strong element of community embeddedness, to understand where things go wrong in aid-induced community participatory projects. It shows how constant negotiations within the community that allowed for the building of trust, the merging of local and technical knowledge, the trialling and adjustments of interventions, and patient lobbying of government officials and field staff are key to unlocking the real benefits of community participation and ensuring social accountability on the part of government agencies. The quick fixes encouraged under development projects, which normally rely on material incentives to generate co-operation, undermine these very principles leading to growing evidence of failure of aid-induced community participatory projects.

ID LIBERALIZATION; INTERESTS
AB East Asian countries have implemented around 60 free trade agreements (FTAs), mostly bilateral, to become one of the most active sites of regionalism. The dominant analyses portray these FTAs as driven primarily by foreign policy motivations and promoted by political leaders with businesses marginally involved or interested. It is contended here that, compared to other forms of liberalization, bilateral FTA negotiations promote new institutional arrangements within government agencies and business associations and unique configurations of government-business relations. Formulation of FTAs imposes greater information demands on government officials, which should compel them to consult business associations. In turn, clearer identification of FTAs' impacts and greater chances to affect their formulation should increase business incentives to lobby for or against FTA liberalization domestically and across borders. Demands on officials and business associations upon successive FTAs should foster institutional change/creation to reduce information and coordination costs. These hypotheses were tested on the bilateral FTAs of Thailand and Malaysia. FTAs in these countries stimulated government-business consultations and lobbying by businesses that, for some key FTAs, took the initiative. Successive negotiations strengthened the technical capacities of officials and business associations and stimulated the emergence of new institutions, which may endure to provide similar functions for multilateral rounds.

DT Article
DE nomenclature; elites; ruling social stratum; soviet heritage;
   post-soviet Russia
AB This article provides insight into regeneration of nomenclature as the ruling social stratum of post-Soviet Russia after the revolutionary events of 1990. This type of political establishment is not a state bureaucracy or a meritocratic elite, but a social phenomenon generated and ontologically inherent in the Soviet political regimes.
   The process of regeneration of nomenclature started when the representatives of the Soviet nomenclature filled the structures of the new Russian government. "Privatization in the Russian style" contributed to the process and led to the formation of nomenclature-oligarchic clans. These clans and their struggle for power and resources form the basis of the vital activity of the Russian nomenklatura.
   During the second term of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, the process of "buying up the state" by nomenclature-oligarchic clans and incorporation of their representatives and lobbyists into executive and legislative power structures significantly intensified. Operation "successor," which brought Vladimir Putin to power in 2000, finalized the formation of the nomenklatura-oligarchic regime as the ruling regime in post-Soviet Russia and Russian nomenklatura as the dominant social stratum.

ID PURE THEORY
AB Economists have adopted two broad perspectives on the state: contractual (i.e., provider of public goods and services) and predatory (coercive and extractive). By a predatory state, we mean a state that promotes the private interests of dominant groups within the state (such as politicians, the army and bureaucrats) or influential private groups with strong lobbying powers. Neo-institutional economists support an extended version of the contractual perspective in which the state is not simply a 'benevolent dictator' but may itself be composed of predators. However, it considers predation as only a means to promote protection. By contrast, a predatory vision of the state argues that while protection and predation are two faces of the same coin, a predatory state protects only to promote its predation on the private sector. This symposium explores how a predatory approach to the state can shed light on all types of state, from liberal democratic to authoritarian and failed ones, both in the past and present.

DE Injecting drug users; Needle syringe; Evaluation; Qualitative; Vietnam
ID INJECTING DRUG-USERS; HIV-INFECTION; RISK
AB Background: Harm reduction has been identified as an important HIV prevention strategy for injecting drug users (IDUs) in Vietnam. However, to date only small geographically limited formal needle syringe programmes (NSPs) have been implemented; and little attention has been given to assessing the effectiveness of the piloted models. Using data from a qualitative evaluation of an NSP in northern Vietnam, this paper assesses the effectiveness of the intervention, examines barriers to the NSP, and documents lessons which can be applied to replicate and scale up interventions across Vietnam.
   Methods: Data were gathered using key informant interviews, focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, observation and intercept interviews with IDUs and other project stakeholders. IDUs were introduced to the evaluation by peer educators (PEs).
   Results: The project contributed to a shift toward safe injecting practices and safe disposal of used needles and syringes (N&S) among IDUs. Collection of used N&S positively influenced community attitudes toward PEs and IDUs. Reduced community discrimination, achieved as a result of project advocacy activities, encouraged IDU to access free needle syringes and other project services provided by PEs. Resistance from the local government officials and community members was turned into support for the programme through intensive advocacy activities. The project highlighted the importance of involving law enforcement in the programme and promoted a public health approach toward working with IDU. However, periodic police campaigns against drug use continued to be an obstacle to successful programme implementation and demonstrated the need for continued efforts to address the issue.
   Conclusion: Programme success is dependent upon community support. Resistance to NSPs can be overcome through a programme of intensive advocacy with community stakeholders including; local government, mass organizations, local residents, IDUs and their families. Garnering the support of law enforcement officials requires a Sustained effort. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims at understanding inclusive capacity of legal system in Turkey by evaluating dynamics of professional advocacy in administrative detention for Syrian refugees in irregular positions. Our empirical study revealed Turkish judicial system, despite its push toward centralization and professionalization in the name of identification by the European impact, has a serious lack of translation and interpretation facilities, procedural incompleteness as the issue of bureaucracy in overloaded functions, and incompetency in migration-specific jurisdiction. We claim these shortcomings associating with manifestation of discrimination toward Syrians disallow to overcome the exclusionary mechanisms toward irregular migrants, except for some attorneys' professional efforts.

DT Article
DE educational finance; state federal aid
ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; ENROLLMENTS
AB Using data for 428 individual campuses in all 50 states, I show that state government funding and tuition and fee revenues at public universities depend on both political and economic factors. State government funding varies depending on the relative size of various interest groups in each state, as well as the ability of public universities to present a united front when dealing with state government. Differences in state government funding at specific campuses reflect differences in the net political benefits to political officials from the supply of instruction, academic research and public service. Net tuition and fee revenues are higher at campuses that receive less state government funding, but also higher in states where public universities have more financial autonomy. The price of attending college thus depends in part on whether the relevant decision makers are state government officials or university administrators. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI 'Voodoo biology': the right-to-life campaign against family planning

SO WOMENS HISTORY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID POLITICS
AB Title X, a federal program funding family planning services in the United States, had broad popular and political support throughout the 1970s. But in the early 1980s, it was subjected to a relentless campaign by anti-abortionists, most notably the Catholic absolutist Judie Brown. Brown blended social with economically conservative rhetoric, attempting to persuade Republican President Ronald Reagan and the broader right-to-life movement that attacking Title X was a legitimate means of targeting its largest recipient, Planned Parenthood. In highlighting Brown's activism and lobbying, and the actions of pro-lifers within the bureaucracy, this article illuminates the strategies of socially conservative women and their place within the contemporary Right. It also historicizes conservative interest in family planning and demonstrates the tension within the Reagan Revolution as single-issue activists struggled to compel the administration to match words with actions.

AB This study examines challenges to HIV-positive people's involvement in AIDS policy making and project design and implementation in Asia. Forty-eight interviews were conducted with key players in the HIV sector in Cambodia, India and Indonesia. The major barrier to involvement is AIDS-related stigma. Most people are diagnosed late in infection and have poor access to antiretroviral drugs. The majority of positive people working in HIV/AIDS have no training in public health or organisational management and few training opportunities are available. Respondents in all countries said NGOs exploit positive people in order to enhance funding opportunities. Representation on policy making bodies is low because the few people well enough to take on these roles often lack the confidence to assert their needs in front of doctors and government officials. Positive activists need advocacy skills to become more effective, encouragement and support to take on roles as educators and counsellors, sustainable incomes, and medication to stay alive.

DT Article
DE distributive justice; elderly people; Japan; long-term care; public
   health nursing
AB This study examines public health nurses' perceptions and concerns about the implications of Japan's new long-term care insurance law concerning care provision for elderly people and their families. Respondents voiced their primary concern about this law as access to services for all elderly people needing care, and defined their major responsibility as strengthening health promotion and illness prevention programmes. Although wanting to expand their roles to meet the health care, social and public policy advocacy needs of elderly persons and their families, respondents also stated their concern for the possible lack of enough resources for this expansion to support family caregivers adequately. They viewed their first function as developing collaborative relationships with local government officials to help to assure sufficient resources to provide the necessary foundation for long-term care programmes to deliver services to all those in need. These concerns fall within the larger ethical issue of distributive justice in a society based on the obligations of the state to citizens and the family to its members, especially elderly relatives, who, according to traditional Japanese values, retain respect.

AB The problem: Nonadherence to prescription medications is a common and costly problem with multiple contributing factors, spanning the dimensions of individual behavior change, psychology, medicine, and health policy, among others. Addressing the problem of medication nonadherence requires strategic input from key experts in a number of fields.
   Meeting of experts: The Medication Adherence Alliance is a group of key experts, predominately from the US, in the field of medication nonadherence. Members include representatives from consumer advocacy groups, community health providers, nonprofit groups, the academic community, decision-making government officials, and industry. In 2015, the Medication Adherence Alliance convened to review the current landscape of medication adherence. The group then established three working groups that will develop recommendations for shifting toward solutions-oriented science.
   Commentary of expert opinion: From the perspective of the Medication Adherence Alliance, the objective of this commentary is to describe changes in the US landscape of medication adherence, framing the evolving field in the context of a recent think tank meeting of experts in the field of medication adherence.

AB We selected three case studies to illustrate environmental injustice issues in the South. These examples relate to migrant agricultural workers, the maquiladora industry and artisanal mining, while reviewing some of the major mechanisms involved, e. g. multinational corporations, the development of free trade zones, multilateral free trade agreements and the export of hazards.
   A series of strategies are discussed in order to address environmental injustice and health disparities that exist on a global scale. Some of the recommendations involve policy initiatives; others, such as research and mentorship, fall within the traditional domain of public health practice. In this paper, special attention is given to concerned environmental and occupational health professionals using evidence-based data for advocacy. For lasting changes to be made, however, stronger institutions and legislation are required. Those who have the 'right to know' about environmental injustice issues include communities of concern, workers' representatives and lawyers. Government officials and company officials may eventually work on the basis of conflict resolution, compensation and remediation, to quote some examples. Systematic approaches to protect both the environment and public health must be updated.

AB The release of government data in an open format is broadly expected to generate innovation and economic value. However, despite the emerging public notoriety of this issue, literature is still scarce regarding the commercial application of open government data. The main goal of this study is to understand how firms use open government data to create value. More specifically, we aim to identify what types of use are currently in place and which industries are more prominent in exploiting open government data. Building on the analysis of a dataset of 178 firms that use open government data across various industries in the U.S. we find twelve different atomic models. Additionally, our findings suggest that the way in which open government is used to create value is contingent to the firms' activities. Supported by robust empirical data, we anticipate that our research produces practical insights to entrepreneurs as well as firm managers in deriving value from public datasets, and equip government officials with relevant evidence for advocacy and policy-making.

SO TOBACCO CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
ID CIGARETTE
AB Objective: This paper examines policy processes regarding why the USA and Norway have not regulated coumarin in tobacco.
   Design: A qualitative analysis of all tobacco industry documents regarding coumarin since the 1950s from the 1998 US Master Settlement Agreement and subsequent legal settlements. Additional data were collected from newspaper reports, general internet search engines, journal articles, scholarly reports, court cases, statutes, regulations, and informal correspondence with tobacco control experts in Norway.
   Main outcome measure: An overview, summary, and analysis of all documents related to coumarin.
   Results: In the USA from 1954 until 1985 when coumarin was reportedly removed from domestic cigarettes, but not from pipe tobacco until 1996, and not at all from imported Indian bidi cigarettes, regulatory efforts were stymied. In Norway, from 1973 to the present, the tobacco industry has never disclosed whether its tobacco products contain coumarin. In both the USA and Norway, the extreme delay and lack of vigorous evidence gathering and significant remedies were caused by tobacco industry assertions that revealing tobacco additives was a violation of trade secrets, and by weak regulatory authority and efforts to regulate coumarin.
   Conclusion: Vigorous and expeditious regulatory investigations and remedies for harmful additives in tobacco, such as coumarin, can protect the public health. Astute insider and outsider political advocacy by health advocates is required to hold elected officials and civil servants publicly accountable for failing to enact disclosure laws and to engage in effective regulatory efforts.

AB The centralized nature of the Russian political system and the dominance of the executive can obscure the role played by other actors in the policymaking process. This article aims to further our understanding of the Russian policy process by examining the ability of industry to determine policy outcomes. An example from the environmental policy process concerning the introduction of the best available technology will be presented. This highly contested policy led to significant opposition from industry groups and disputes between government actors. The case demonstrates that industrial interests in Russia are able to exert considerable influence on the policy process; however, this influence is not absolute and requires closer scrutiny. Political leadership was found to be an important factor in achieving policy outcomes. However, for the most part, the policy process was found to be heavily bureaucratized, and dominated by a range of competing interests.

TI "We are Talking about Saving Lives": The Welfare State, Health Care

DE Welfare state; health care policy; nongovernability; Israel
ID POLITICS; PARTICIPATION; BUREAUCRATS
AB Literature about welfare states worldwide, and specifically in Israel, emphasizes economic and political variables and the importance of ideology in explaining a given social policy in those societies. According to this literature, ideology and strategic long-term goals account for the waning of the Israeli welfare state since the 1970s. At the same time, for upwards of a decade, the literature dealing with Israeli public policy has emphasized that Israeli society suffers from a crisis of nongovernability and a political culture that is characterized by illegality. The author defines nongovernability as the inability to formulate public policy and implement it effectively over time. In such an environment, long-term strategic considerations based on a coherent ideology take a back seat to short-term considerations in the conduct of the various players in the public policy arena. The author discusses the building of a hospital in Ashdod as a case study in nongovernability. The hospital's construction was steeped in political intrigue based wholly on short-term considerations and was built in a political culture characterized by either illegality or outright rejection of the law. This behavior is characteristic of Israeli politicians, bureaucrats, and interest groups. The author maintains that the creation of this hospital is emblematic of the Israeli health care policy overall, a policy shaped by bottom-up processes whose defining characteristic is a political culture based on illegality and narrow, short-term interests.

AB The world is rapidly changing and the future is uncertain, yet until recently the dominant assumption of the local passenger transport community has been that the existing modal landscape of cars, buses and taxis will remain much as it is now. Such a view is now shifting however, with decision makers now appreciating the need to understand the implications of potentially radical changes in the technological, political, economic, social and environmental spheres. Accordingly, in August 2015 the Public Transport 2045 study was commissioned to consider how different local public transport futures might affect society over the next 30-years, and at how governments might best respond.
   The multi-phase study was based on individual in-depth interviews with 50 senior local passenger transport operators, government officials, lobbyists and experts from New Zealand and around the world; and four validation workshops with 28 sector stakeholders. The data was analysed using mostly pre-determined themes from which four scenarios were constructed and then validated. The implications are that the local passenger transport system is about to transition to a system of 'shared mobility'; public transport will need to evolve to stay relevant but will remain important in any scenario; and the role of Government will be vital in overseeing the transition to the shared mobility era. These lessons are now being used to inform transport and broader policy decisions across New Zealand. Overall, the study is the first to apply such a global and qualitatively rich dataset to view the long-term future local passenger transport system as a whole.

AB Democracy was the great victor of the Second World War. In contrast to the kaleidoscopic variety of regimes which had emerged in Europe during the preceding thirty years, the political structure of Western Europe from 1945 to the 1960s possessed a remarkable uniformity. Despite significant national differences, Europe's postwar model of democracy was based on a number of key characteristics: the reassertion of the authority of the nation-state and of directly-elected parliaments as well as a culture of coalition government which accorded considerable freedom of manoeuvre to the central bureaucracy and to paragovernmental lobbyists at the expense of direct popular participation. This article explores the reasons which underpinned the successful stabilization of this particular form of democracy in postwar Europe. Though the Cold War and rapid economic growth were influential factors, the remarkable resilience of liberal parliamentary regimes must also be related to the more individualist and depoliticized society which emerged from the war years, to changes in the structure and attitudes of the social elites and to the successful construction of a dominant class alliance of the middle classes and the rural populations of Europe, symbolized by the electoral success of Christian Democracy.

ID AMERICAN FEDERALISM; POLICY; POLITICS
AB Although state resistance to federal mandates is a prevalent characteristic of contemporary American federalism, little is known about the factors that separate resisting states from states that do not oppose federal policy. This article examines state resistance through a framework that classifies public policies by salience and complexity and identifies societal interests and government officials who are hypothesised to influence policy making on issues of varying types. These hypotheses are investigated in the context of state resistance to four federal laws - the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, No Child Left Behind Act, Help America Vote Act and REAL ID Act. The results of the statistical analysis demonstrate the centrality of the characteristics of citizens, elected officials and specialised interest groups in conditioning state resistance to federal mandates. These results suggest that state resistance can be characterised as a strategic response to federal mandates that varies systematically across types of public policies.

AB Workforce diversity requires broader vision and scope in managing diversity so that there is greater inclusion inside and outside organizations. This paper provides this vision by extending the stream of workforce diversity research to community-oriented inclusion and its processes. The authors interviewed 34 people with disabilities and 40 people without disabilities who were stakeholders of community arts and sports organizations. The participants with disabilities were mainly arts audiences, artists and sports athletes, and the participants without disabilities were mainly managers and government officials. The key findings report the importance of inclusion through common interest groups being facilitated by (1) non-minority specific communal activities, (2) listening to minority voices, (3) multidimensional accessibility, (4) availability of organizational and natural champions and (5) cross-boundary networks and collaborations. In order to create more inclusive organizations, the authors suggest that private organizations need more community-oriented values, goals and strategies that foster boundaryless inclusion of people with disabilities and other minority groups in organizations and society.

DT Article
ID GOVERNANCE; SECURITY
AB Cybersecurity demands are forcing public officials across the globe to focus on two core values that often conflicttransparency (the public good) and privacy (citizen and private sector confidentiality). An e-survey of Florida county government officials measures how cross-pressured they are, identifies the types of information about individuals and government employees that are the most difficult to protect, examines the interest groups (public, private, and nonprofit) that act as watchdogs, and delineates the actions administrators see as critical to promoting balance. The results show intense cross-pressures and greater difficulty in protecting citizens' bioinformation, medical records, and financial data than in securing employee information. Information technology professionals and their associations are the most active in tracking privacy protection. The media and citizen activists monitor transparency the closest. More funding, personnel, equipment, and training, better software, more rigorous enforcement, and clearer standards and procedures are needed to balance privacy protection and transparency in cybersecurity policy making.

TI AFTER QUALIFIED IMMUNITY
SO COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID LIABILITY; LAW; ENFORCEMENT; LITIGATION; LAWSUITS; PEARSON; RIGHTS; FEES
AB Courts, scholars, and advocacy organizations across the political spectrum are calling on the Supreme Court to limit qualified immunity or do away with the defense altogether. They argue-and offer compelling evidence to show-the doctrine bears little resemblance to defenses available when Section 1983 became law, undermines government accountability, and is both unnecessary and ill-suited to shield government defendants from the burdens and distractions of litigation. Some Supreme Court Justices appear to share critics' concerns. Indeed, in 2017, Justice Thomas wrote that "[i]n an appropriate case, we should reconsider our qualified immunity jurisprudence." If the Court does reconsider qualified immunity, it will find compelling reasons to abolish or greatly limit the defense. Yet the Court may be reluctant to take this type of dramatic action for fear that doing so would harm government and society as a whole.
   This Article offers five predictions about how constitutional litigation would function in a world without qualified immunity that should assuage these concerns. First, there would be clarification of the law but modest, if any, adjustment to the scope of constitutional rights. Second, plaintiffs' and defendants' litigation success rates would remain relatively constant. Third, the average cost, time, and complexity associated with litigating constitutional claims would decrease. Fourth, more civil rights lawsuits would likely be filed, but other doctrines and financial considerations would mean that attorneys would continue to have strong incentives to decline insubstantial cases. Fifth, indemnification and budgeting practices would continue to shield most government agencies and officials from the financial consequences of damages awards.
   If these predictions are correct, abolishing qualified immunity would clarify the law, reduce the costs of litigation, and shift the focus of Section 1983 litigation to what should be the critical question at issue in these cases-whether government officials have exceeded their constitutional authority. But eliminating qualified immunity would not significantly alter the scope of constitutional protections, dramatically increase plaintiffs' success rates, or transform government practices that currently dampen the effects of lawsuits on officers' and officials' decision making. Doomsday scenarios imagined by some commentators-of courthouses flooded with frivolous claims-would not come to pass. And constitutional litigation would often still fail to hold government officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly.
   The Supreme Court should not avoid reconsidering qualified immunity for fear that doing so would dramatically magnify the effects of lawsuits against government officials. And government accountability advocates should recognize that eliminating qualified immunity would not fundamentally shift dynamics that make it difficult for plaintiffs to redress constitutional violations and deter government wrongdoing.

AB This study reexamines the political and cultural dimensions of the New World Information and Communication Order debates, which were hosted by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization during the height of the Cold War. By both revealing stakes of - and enacting the values underpinning - the contest between the 'free flow' and 'fair flow' models of the press, these debates helped determine the eventual trajectory of the globalization of journalism. After an historical review which synthesizes contemporaneous press coverage and scholarly accounts, the author offers an analysis which emphasizes the disparate cultural commitments and the 'performance' of opposition by various actors (including journalists, academics, and government officials) on each side of the debate. Although there has been significant scholarly inquiry into the New World Information and Communication Order debates and the 'MacBride Report' which emerged from them, much of the previous research has focused each side's distinct political or economic interests. By examining these debates through the lens of culture, this study illuminates the competing opinions, attitudes, and beliefs which contributed to the United States' withdrawal in protest from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (and to its reentry 20 years later) and the rise of international press freedom advocacy organizations. At a moment when elected leaders in the United States are once again ambivalent regarding their commitment to international institutions and their leadership position within international press freedom advocacy, this historical analysis offers an instructive account of a past breakdown in official diplomacy and revisits the values underpinning Western ideals of press freedom.

AB As part of the ongoing efforts to address the lack of clinical research on older adults with cancer, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the US Food and Drug Administration cosponsored a public workshop on geriatric oncology in November 2017. The goals were to review progress, build collaborations across stakeholders, and generate new action items for increasing the evidence base for treating older adults with cancer. It built on previous work of the Institute of Medicine, ASCO, and the U13 Conferences convened by the Cancer and Aging Research Group, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Aging between 2010 and 2015. The workshop drew a diverse group of presenters, panelists, and attendees, including academic and clinical oncologists, regulators, other government officials, representatives from industry, and patient advocacy groups. Attendees at the workshop were tasked with proposing next steps to address the lack of evidence on treating older adults with cancer. Based on the workshop discussions, four new action items to move the field forward were developed: 1) increase enrollment of older adults in clinical trials, 2) collect more information on older adults enrolled on clinical trials, 3) expand the use of real-world data in research on older adults, and 4) strengthen collaboration between stakeholders to develop advocacy and policy solutions. These action items, alongside the previous ASCO, Institute of Medicine, and U13 recommendations, provide a strategy for improving the evidence base for treating older adults with cancer and ensuring all patients with cancer receive high-quality, evidence-based care.

AB This paper develops a model in which a desire to avoid criticism prompts otherwise public-spirited bureaucrats to behave inefficiently. Decisions are taken to keep interest groups quiet and to keep mistakes out of the public eye. The policy implications of this "minimal squawk" behavior are at odds with the view that agencies should be structured to minimize the threat of "capture." An empirical test using data from US State Public Utility Commissions rejects the capture hypothesis and is consistent with the squawk hypothesis: longer PUC terms of office are associated with a higher incidence of rate reviews and lower household electricity bills.

ID CONDITIONALITY
AB Research into IMF program implementation has usually taken the form of large sample regression analyses. A more detailed explanation is offered in this paper through a case study of program implementation in Turkey between 1999 and 2004. Our research is based on a series of in-depth interviews with policy makers, program negotiators, bureaucrats, interest groups and IMF personnel. Our results reinforce hypotheses that emerge from the theory of implementation and the large sample econometric work, but they also offer new and enhanced explanations. Program implementation depends on a range of factors which interact with one another. These include domestic political economy factors, such as the importance of special interest groups, political cohesiveness and program ownership by the government and the IMF, but also other idiosyncratic factors such as, in the case of Turkey, the existence of a crisis, the desire to join the EU and the role of influential technocrats. Our research has implications for the design of IMF programs.

AB The domestic violence (DV) movement in Japan demonstrates one way civil society can influence national policy. The leadership of the DV movement built a large and diverse coalition representing more than 50 DV-related organizations all over Japan, which generated expertise on the ground, autonomy to focus on the issue, and an electoral opportunity for DV law reformers. DV leaders also developed an effective alliance with bipartisan female politicians. By turning their demands into 179 questions addressed to government bureaucrats, they generated responses that enabled women in politics to exercise effective pressure in favor of change . Analyzing this new type of activism, which I call "civic lawmaking," offers a close look at a fresh form of legislative advocacy and deepens our understanding of the state-society relationship in Japan.(1)

AB The question of having competent lawyers and judges is becoming increasingly important in the twenty-first century and is also attracting the attention of specialists from large law firms; students of educational institutions (lawyers, administrative staff); politicians and economic experts. Consequently, through the documentary method, this research work analyzes the problem of training highly qualified legal personnel, elaborating priority tasks and various development strategies. The authors examine the current situation in this area in European countries, emphasizing their experience. The article is addressed to experts in the field, such as specialists working in law firms (lawyers and staff), students of higher education institutions (lawyers, administrative staff), political scientists, economists, civil servants. It is concluded that competency-based education using cutting-edge technologies improves the educational system of Ukraine and, at the same time, adapts it to the standards of Western Europe with a gradual result of production of highly qualified lawyers.

AB Metropolitan Australia is suffering from a serious shortage of acute hospital beds. Simplistic comparisons with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development bed numbers are misleading because of the hybrid Australian public/private hospital system. The unavailability of most private beds for acute emergency cases and urban/rural bed imbalances have not been adequately considered. There is a lack of advocacy for acute bed availability. This attitude permeates government, health professions and the health bureaucracy. Planners, politicians, analysts and the media have adopted false hopes of reducing acute demand by prevention and primary care strategies, vital as these services are to a balanced healthcare system. This paper directly challenges the ideology that says Australia depends too heavily on hospital-based healthcare. Rebuilding the bed base requires recognition of the need for an adequate acute hospital service and strong advocacy for bed-based care in the medical and nursing professionals who should be driving policy. The forces opposing bed-based care are strong and solutions might include legislative definition of bed numbers and availability.

ID DIRECT DEMOCRACY; EUROPEAN-UNION; MEMBERSHIP; WORLD; PARTY
AB Does more citizen participation necessarily improve the democratic quality and/or the effectiveness of government? What forms of participation have the potential to accomplish these goals? And, more important, how can these participatory mechanisms be integrated into traditional representative and bureaucratic governance practices, in order to grasp this potential? We discuss these questions in the article, building on theories and empirical evidence provided by both political science and public administration studies. The conclusion we reach is that participatory empowered mechanisms, such as popular initiatives and referendums, and public-private co-governance councils, have a clear potential to enhance the effectiveness and responsiveness of public governance. However, we also find that in order to secure these benefits and not compromise equality and accountability, the introduction of these mechanisms needs to come together with strong and highly representative legislatures, and with reforms that align the powers and increase the representativeness of interest groups.

AB Background: Clinical trials have shown cannabis to be effective in the treatment of some medical conditions and there is mounting public and political pressure to enact laws enabling the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. To date, 28 United States (U.S.)states and the District of Columbia have enacted medical cannabis laws. This study sought to identify the main issues pertaining to the development of medical cannabis laws in the U.S, including the role of scientific evidence.
   Methods: Data were collected from three groups of participants: government officials, lobbyists and medical professionals involved in the medical cannabis debate in five selected states in the U.S.; researchers from the same five states conducting funded research in the alcohol and other drugs field; and members of the International Society for the Study of Drug Policy. The data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Six major themes emerged in relation to the factors influencing policy: scientific evidence plays a limited role in the development of policy; the available research is limited and mixed; there is a need for clearer communication and active dissemination of evidence to policy makers; researchers need to consider what research is likely to impact on policy; scientific evidence is not a major factor in policy development; and there is a need to consider evidence within a political context.
   Conclusion: Researchers need to be aware of the political context in which medical cannabis laws are or are not enacted and consider ways in which research findings can achieve a higher profile within this context. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Using focus group discussion with participants from 4 NGOs in Ghana that focus on anti-domestic violence advocacy and survivor and victims support work, this research takes a closer look at the experiences organi-zations have while accessing government supported available institutional resources. Findings suggest that while legislation has indeed created the space for women's rights in Ghana, the pathways towards justice in both the north and the south are thwarted by an underfunded and poorly managed bureaucracy, complicated by an overall patriarchal attitude. There is thus a need to increase gender sensitivity training among all ranks and sections of government institutions and bureaucracy. Research findings also suggest a need for increased funding and the establishment of a well-organized network between survivors, organizations and various government departments and legal aid to create efficient networks that facilitate faster reporting, communication, and de-livery of justice. More importantly, research participant directed policy recommendations suggest a renewed attempt to strengthening existing laws, the creation of an easily accessible survivor support fund that involves less bureaucratic navigation and a goal towards building self-efficacy and skills, and an institutional process that involves survivors in policy planning and implementation.

AB In 2002 Nepal's parliament passed a liberal abortion low, after nearly three decodes of reform efforts. This paper reviews the history of the movement for reform and the combination of factors that contributed to its success. These include sustained advocacy for reform; the dissemination of knowledge, information and evidence; adoption of the reform agenda by the public sector and its leadership in involving other stakeholders; the existence of work for safe motherhood as the context in which the initiative could gain support; an active women's rights movement and support from international and multilateral organisations; sustained involvement of local NGOs, civil society and professional organisations; the involvement of journalists and the media; the absence of significant opposition; courageous government officials and an enabling democratic political system. The overriding rationale for reforming the abortion low in Nepal has been to ensure safe motherhood and women's rights. The first government abortion services officially began in March 2004 at the Maternity Hospital in Kathmandu; services will be expanded gradually to other public and private hospitals and private clinics in the coming years. &COPY; 2004 Reproductive Health Matters.

AB This paper argues that the ability of dominant corporations in the fossil fuel and other polluting industries to shape government policy on climate change and energy issues is directly related to their financial interests in particular countries, and emblematic of the crippling effect which they have exercised on the ability of nation states to decarbonise. Using Australia as an exemplar of the many favourable policy outcomes which powerful corporate interests have secured from successive governments in relation to climate and energy policy, it seeks to demonstrate that covert networks of political influence have played a major role in the decisions made and actions implemented in both areas of policymaking over the last fifteen years. Through detailed empirical analysis of a database of current and former senior politicians, political staffers and bureaucrats with employment links to the fossil fuel and resource extraction industries, it argues that these industries have constructed a covert network of lobbyists and revolving door appointments which has ensured that industry interests continue to dominate Australia's energy policy, and that its emissions from fossil fuel use continue to rise. Covert corporate influence in Australia's energy and resource sectors provides an additional layer of explanation for the persistence of structural biases in its financing, policy and regulatory regimes to those accounts which draw on different forms of discourse and policy analysis.

LA English
DT Article
ID RIGHTS
AB Foreshadowed by the anti-war cause, women's and gay liberation struggles, and the conservation movement, and inspired by Peter Singer's 1975 book Animal Liberation, a fresh wave of animal activism emerged in Australia in the mid-seventies. In the struggle for animal rights, campaigners used a range of methods, but what characterised the eighties was their lobbying. They engaged politicians, built alliances, and participated in the state. By doing so, they changed Australian politics: they extended the political agenda; influenced public policy; and reshaped the state bureaucracy to include new avenues for addressing animal protection. At the same time, their outcomes were limited, sometimes founded on compromise and failure. The property status of animals was a fundamental constraint that produced differentiated and contradictory policy outcomes. The degree to which the animal movement succeeded in reducing animal suffering is a contentious matter that divides minimalist and maximalist accounts. Ultimately, however, animal advocates were instrumental in advancing the basic animal protection framework evident in Australia today.

AB Objectives: The objective was to evaluate seminal fluid indices of male partners of infertile couples so as to identify the current status of the contributions of male factor to infertility in our environment. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study of the seminal fluid indices of consecutively consenting male partners of infertile couples seen at the Fertility and Endocrinology Research unit of the Department of Obstetrics Gynaecology and Perinatology, Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Ile-Ife between May 2004 and June 2008. Results: The results of the semen analysis of 661 male partners of the infertile couples were retrieved and analyzed. The patterns of semen parameters noted in infertile males were oligozoospermia, teratozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, azoospermia, oligoteratozoospermia, oligoasthenozoospermia, and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, asthenoteratozoospermia found in 25.6, 18.5, 11.5, 6.2, 3.2, 2.3, 2.1, and 0.9, respectively. Among the age groups, age group 31-40 had a higher prevalence of oligozoospermia (13.3) while among the occupational groups, the civil servants had the highest prevalence of oligozoospermia (12). There was a high of level of leucocytospermia and bacterial infections in both normospermic and oligospermic semen. Conclusion: This study showed a high rate of abnormal semen quality of male partners of infertile couple in our environment and is an indication for the need to focus on the management of this condition and the institution of preventive program for male infertility. There is urgent need for advocacy for men to accept responsibility for their contribution to infertility and to reduce stigmatization and ostracizing of women for infertility.

AB A substantial literature has been devoted to analyzing how legislators delegate regulatory power to a more knowledgeable agency. Yet, much less attention has been paid to understand how this delegation process is shaped by the environment in which this agency operates, and more specifically by the actions of interest groups. We propose a model of regulatory capture to assess how the distribution of information across interest groups and agencies impacts optimal delegation. Whether an interest group and his agency share information or not determines the scope for capture and how much discretion should be left to this agency in response. Whether asymmetric information reduces or increases discretion depends on the biases of the group and the agency vis-a-vis Congress. Groups that are more aligned with Congress collect politically relevant information, while more extreme groups remain poorly informed. The information structure that endogenously emerges increases discretion under broad circumstances.

AB Who provides the European Union with information? This article examines patterns of participation in the large expert group system under the European Commission. It explores competing propositions about the character of the Commission's information system, and tests four hypotheses about what affects participation in the EU expert group system. The authors distinguish between three kinds of information providers: scientists, societal actors and government officials. The empirical section of the paper builds upon an analysis of a data set covering all of the Commission expert groups (N=1237). Although scientists, and interest groups, industries and NGOs are prevalent information providers for the Commission, the authors show that the informational foundation is strongly biased towards officials from national administrations. They argue that these distinct patterns of participation are significantly affected by inter-institutional and environmental conditions that the Commission Directorate Generals operate under. Access of experts increases the ability of the Commission to anticipate reactions to its proposals and initiatives and hence it impinges on the inter-institutional dynamic of the EU.

AB When do states forge technological change in mature industries? This article challenges the emphasis on bureaucratic autonomy in explaining the ability of governments to promote technological change. We show that structural features of the bureaucracy alone are insufficient to account for variation in policy intervention, and argue that sectoral patterns of interest intermediation shape state capacity. Political coordination leads industry and government to broker technological transformations in consensus-driven negotiations. This prioritizes the interests of incumbent firms, likely resulting in regulatory capture and weak policy intervention. Political competition among interest groups and state agencies, by contrast, allows policy-makers to organize coalitions of technology challengers, likely leading to strong policy intervention. We examine this argument in the case of electric vehicle policy in Germany and the United States. Germany failed to disrupt its auto sector to transition to electric vehicles, while the United States adopted comprehensive policies for the manufacturing and commercialization of electric cars against incumbent opposition. Counter to conventional wisdom, our findings suggest that states can effectively engage in sectoral intervention to drive technological change in the absence of autonomous bureaucracies.

AB The political reforms that have been going on since the 1990s have drastically changed the face of politics in Japan. The most significant of these reforms was the change of government, which brought an end, albeit only once, to the long-standing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) regime. These changes were expected to change the power structure by altering the contact of interest groups with political elites. I examine this issue based on a longitudinal survey conducted in four rounds between 1997 and 2017.
   The results show a robust structure of interest group politics, although the features were weakening. That is, contacts with the LDP and the bureaucracy were sources of political influence for interest groups. The impact of the two-party system and its setbacks are seen in the change in contact with the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). However, The DPJ did not function as a source of interest representation.

AB Private for-profit home care providers have grown unevenly in Europe and through varied processes. Yet, more research focusing directly on private providers is needed to identify and explain European patterns in their growth and in their modes of operation. This paper examines the case of Ireland, where private providers have grown significantly in recent years and transformed the national landscape of domiciliary care. First, it is shown that the amount of public funding received by private providers increased from euro3 million in 2006 to euro176 million in 2019, in contrast to amounts allocated to non-profit and public providers that have increased only slightly. Second, those trends are explained through policy analysis and by drawing on in-depth semi-structured interviews (n= 12) with private home care providers and government officials who have been central to the privatization of care. The paper gives a direct voice to key figures in private home care, and through a critical reading of interview materials, argues that the neoliberal nature of the Irish state has driven the growth of private provision, in particular, through policies of competitive tendering and fiscalization. Providers' own lobbying activities have also played a role, albeit a secondary one. Ireland has traditionally followed a laissez-faire, family-based system comparable to Southern European countries. Its experience is thus directly relevant to that region, but further research should also compare and contrast the development of private providers operating in other European long-term care regimes.

AB A consideration of rulemaking petitions to the Federal Communication Commission takes advantage of a highly formalized process to help systematically examine the influence that regulated parties have on agenda formation. Since the 1960s, submissions of petitions for rulemaking to the FCC have generated an increasingly large share of the agency's entire rulemaking agenda, and success for petitions is clearly greater for powerful organized interests. But an analysis of the 237 petitions for rulemaking at the FCC demonstrates that powerful interests are limited in their ability to control the agency's agenda. For example, efforts to divert the agency's attention by submitting comments opposing petitions are, at best, inconsequential and may be counterproductive. In addition, the most powerful organized interests who submit petitions for rulemaking at the FCC experience less success when confronting a more liberal commission majority.

AB One underexplored question in the representative bureaucracy literature is whether public employees advocate for their demographic groups at the expense of other groups or their organizational roles. Many studies have focused on the link between passive representation, or the extent to which the public workforce reflects the demographic characteristics of its clients, and active representation, or the extent to which policies advance the interests of those people. However, little research has been done on whether and when increased representation by a certain group enhances overall organizational performance. This study examines the relationship between racial minority representation in U.S. federal agencies and the agencies' goal achievement while considering the moderating role of organizational mission and diversity climate. The panel data analysis shows that increased minority representation lowers agencies' goal achievement. However, a positive relationship exists between the two in agencies that mainly work to promote social equity for disadvantaged populations and foster a positive diversity climate in the workplace. These findings suggest that racial minority employees can better contribute to organizational success in agencies where they balance advocacy and organizational roles well and they are treated fairly and respectfully.

AB This article investigates how local political context-including civil society and political parties-influences the development of migrant care worker policies in Taiwan. This is particularly important in a national context where the government has actively utilized migrant care worker policies to solve the crisis in the social welfare sector. This article draws upon documentary analysis of policy debates on the proposed implementation of Long-Term Care Insurance and in-depth interviews with government officials, public service providers and non-governmental organizations to explore how the political alliances of political parties, social organizations, and interest groups affect policy outcomes. While current research focuses on the relationship between social welfare policies and the employment of migrant care workers, this article highlights the local political context and explores how political alliances have influenced the development of migrant care worker policies. This article argues that institutional path dependency and the strong policy alliance between the progressive party and social welfare organizations have stymied changes in migrant care worker policies and prevented Taiwan from further socializing the eldercare sector.

DT Article
ID PARTICIPATION; TEACHERS; PATTERNS; UNIONS; WAR
AB Government policies can activate a political constituency not only by providing material resources to, or altering the interpretive experiences of, individual citizens, but also by directly subsidizing established interest groups. We argue that state laws mandating collective bargaining for public employees provided organizational subsidies to public sector labor unions that lowered the costs of mobilizing their members to political action. Exploiting variation in the timing of laws across the states and using data on the political participation of public school teachers from 1956 to 2004, we find that the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law significantly boosted subsequent political participation among teachers. We also identify increased contact from organized groups seeking to mobilize teachers as a likely mechanism that explains this finding. These results have important implications for the current debate over collective bargaining rights and for our understanding of policy feedback, political parties and interest groups, and the bureaucracy.

ID CIVIC JOURNALISM
AB This study exposes a unique model of journalism - "obsessive-activist" reporting. Motivated by a strong sense of justice and a passion to make a significant change, these journalists promote their social or political agenda in both spheres: the professional and the public. In the professional, they do it through an obsessive and continuing reporting on the issue they care for, while in the public sphere, they are personally involved in activities such as lobbying and consulting politicians and bureaucrats, or personal assistance to individuals and groups in need. Based on a thorough review of literature on journalism models and on studies of journalistic role perceptions, and after a series of in-depth interviews with 17 obsessive-activist journalists, the authors suggest that obsessive-activist journalism is a unique model of journalism and the most interventionist one. However, unlike other interventionist models of journalism, the obsessive-activist journalists adhere most of the time to traditional journalistic norms and practices. While former interventionist models challenged mainstream news reporting from outside, obsessive activists hybridize it from the inside, adding new avenues to adjust and survive in rapidly changing news environments.

AB This paper considers a domain of governance and trade freedom indicators in order to reveal some of the dimensions along which the MENA region's intra-regional trade and export intensity might be fostered. Historically, conflicts, crises and oil interests have impeded intra-MENA integration efforts and kept trade-flow intensities between the region's countries below those of its trade with RoW. But it seems evident that similarities in the governance and trade freedom indicators of MENA countries would promote such trade flows. Our empirical methodology here is to use a classical trade gravity model with augmented variables to measure intra-regional trade and export flows for MENA countries and compare them with flows for MENA_E.U. and MENA_RoW. We develop three sets of scenarios to capture the impact of governance and trade freedom indicators accordingly: First, we introduce a standardised polity index to measure its impact on accelerating intra MENA's export flows compared with MENA_EU and MENA_RoW. Second, we introduce a range-based Polity IV index and trade freedom index to test whether similarity in the governance indicators of MENA countries leads to significant intra-regional trade flows. We also test the interaction between both. Finally, to check the robustness of export flows, we include World Governance Indicators (WGI) and their sub-components in the estimations. The main result is that when two MENA trade partners are both classified as mixed regimes under the Polity IV index ranges, the coefficient becomes highly significant and bilateral trade flows increase by 1.25%. Components of (WGI) specifying government effectiveness, rule of law and control of corruption increase exports for MENA's origin exporter countries. Finally, the interaction term (Polity IV and Trade freedom ranges) captures continuous improvement in the quality of governance and self-regulated systems implemented by governing executives and authorities as they shift away from pressure and interest groups. This leads to higher degrees of mutual understanding and benefits to the region's trade flows and policies.

TI An exploratory study identifying where local government public health

AB Issue addressed: The Western Australian (WA) Public Health Bill will replace the antiquated Health Act 1911. One of the proposed clauses of the Bill requires all WA local governments to develop a Public Health Plan. The Bill states that Public Health Plans should be based on evidence from all levels, including national and statewide priorities, community needs, local statistical evidence, and stakeholder data.
   Methods: This exploratory study, which targeted 533 WA local government officers, aimed to identify the sources of evidence used to generate the list of public health risks to be included in local government Public Health Plans.
   Results: The top four sources identified for informing local policy were: observation of the consequences of the risks in the local community (24.5%), statewide evidence (17.6%), local evidence (17.6%) and coverage in local media (16.2%).
   Conclusions: This study confirms that both hard and soft data are used to inform policy decisions at the local level. Therefore, the challenge that this study has highlighted is in the definition or constitution of evidence.
   So what? Evidence is critical to the process of sound policy development. This study highlights issues associated with what actually constitutes evidence in the policy development process at the local government level. With the exception of those who work in an extremely narrow field, it is difficult for local government officers, whose role includes policymaking, to read the vast amount of information that has been published in their area of expertise. For those who are committed to the notion of evidence-based policymaking, as advocated within the WA Public Health Bill, this presents a considerable challenge.

AB The demand for decentralized government has increased with widespread political devolution, because it is perceived as a more efficient and accountable form of government. However, the limited autonomy in subnational governments is criticized, for fiscal decentralization has the potential to increase corruption and to harm government accountability, because representatives and bureaucrats in local governments may be involved in private corporations and other special interest groups. Moreover, little attention has been paid to U.S. state and local governments. This study considers multiple perspectives in fiscal decentralization in the state governments, and examines the effects of fiscal decentralization on state corruption. The empirical findings contribute to the argument in the extant research that corruption in U.S. state governments increases in a more decentralized structure.

AB Lodhran/Rahim Yar Khan (RYK) model of primary healthcare is a home-grown experiment in Pakistan. The model envisaged transferring the management of primary healthcare facilities to a public sector NGO. The paper finds that through the re-alignment of interest groups, the model was replicated in several other districts of the province. It also examines the evolution of stakeholders' behaviour, interest, position and influence in its implementation over a period of time. The study concludes that sustainability of the model remains doubtful unless public sector health bureaucracy is restructured and made to work effectively. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Lapdogs, watchdogs, and scapegoats: The press and national security
   information
SO INDIANA LAW JOURNAL
LA English
DT Review
ID PRIVILEGE; LAW
AB In the United States, the executive branch possesses virtually unbridled authority to keep national security information from the public. Although the Freedom of Information Act and whistle blower protection laws serve as some check on the executive's power, these tools remain largely ineffectual. Because the desire for tight information control competes with the demands of news gathering, a "game of leaks" has developed among government officials and reporters in which the press alternatively serves as lapdogs, watchdogs, and scape goats for the executive branch.
   This Article demonstrates that the government has been communicating information to the public through leaks ever since the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt. Legal developments in the current climate, including the ongoing prosecution of two lobbyists for violations of the Espionage Act in the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee case, have the potential to establish precedents that could impose dire consequences upon this crucial information flow. This Article scrutinizes the constitutionality of prosecuting nongovernmental parties for the publication of classified information by examining the long and complicated history of the relationship between the press and the executive branch, and the role leaks play in the dissemination of classified information to the public today.
   After examining the relationship between the press and the executive branch, as well as tracing the development of the reasoning behind the applicable First Amendment doctrine, this Article ultimately argues that in any prosecution against a nongovernmental actor for disseminating national security information, the government must demonstrate not only that the disclosure posed an immediate, serious, and direct threat to national security, but also that the offender either intended the disclosure to harm the United States or help a foreign nation, or that the offender was recklessly indifferent to the harm that the disclosure would cause. Given that the executive branch has so much power to control the dissemination of national security information to the public, and itself leaks information to support its agenda, its power to punish the publication of leaks must be extremely limited. An intent requirement is consistent with the Supreme Court's free speech jurisprudence and helps achieve this goal.
   An intent requirement will encourage the government and the press to continue their historical cooperation when the publication of certain information poses a serious threat to national security interests. It will create an incentive for government officials to explain their national security concerns to the press, and it will simultaneously hold the press accountable for any reckless disregard shown toward genuine threats. This approach seeks to strike the proper balance between the executive branch's vast ability to control the dissemination of national security information to the public-often through calculated leaks-and the need to maintain the secrecy of information that is truly sensitive.

AB Groundwater over-exploitation has been on the rise in Jordan. Competing demands have grown in the face of perennial water shortages, a situation which has been exacerbated by drought conditions in the past decade. This paper reports findings of a project in which management options to address over-exploitation were developed for one of Jordan's principal aquifer systems, the Amman-Zarqa Basin. Options for addressing the situation were developed through a participatory approach that involved government officials and various public and private sector interest groups. Particular efforts were made to involve well irrigators, who are likely to be heavily impacted by the changes required to reduce groundwater pumping to a sustainable level. With information obtained from a rapid appraisal survey as well as from interviews with farmers, community groups, government officials, and technical experts, an extensive set of options was identified for evaluation. Based on integrated hydrogeologic, social, and economic analysis, five complementary management options were recommended for implementation. These included the establishment of an Irrigation Advisory Service, buying out farm wells, placing firm limits on well abstraction and irrigated crop areas, exchanging treated wastewater for groundwater, and measures to increase the efficiency of municipal and industrial water use. Various combinations and levels of these options were grouped in scenarios, representing possible implementation strategies. The scenarios were designed to assist decision makers, well owners and other stakeholders in moving gradually towards a sustainable abstraction regime. Social and economic aspects of each option and scenario were analyzed and presented to stakeholders, together with a summary of legal, institutional and environmental ramifications. Combining scientific analysis with a participatory approach in the Amman Zarqa Basin groundwater management was devised as a prototype to be used in the management of other groundwater basins in Jordan. This participatory management approach would also be useful in other parts of the world that are experiencing similar groundwater over-exploitation problems.

AB This paper provides an overview of legal, religious, medical and social factors that serve to support or hinder women's access to safe abortion services in the 21 predominantly Muslim countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where one in ten pregnancies ends in abortion. Reform efforts, including progressive interpretations of Islam, have resulted in laws allowing for early abortion on request in two countries; six others permit abortion on health grounds and three more also allow abortion in cases of rope or fetal impairment. However, medical and social factors limit access to safe abortion services in all but Turkey and Tunisia. To address this situation, efforts are increasing in a few countries to introduce post-abortion care, document the magnitude of unsafe abortion and understand women's experience of unplanned pregnancy. Religious fotawa have been issued allowing abortions in certain circumstances. An understanding of variations in Muslim beliefs and practices, and the interplay between politics, religion, history and reproductive rights is key to understanding abortion in different Muslim societies. More needs to be done to build on efforts to increase women's rights, engage community leaders, support progressive religious leaders and government officials and promote advocacy among health professionals.

DT Article
ID POLITICS
AB The literature often contrasts interest groups possessing insider status and outsider groups forced to seek influence through more indirect means. Drawing on data from a survey of all national Danish interest groups, this article demonstrates that most groups have an action repertoire including both direct contacts to bureaucrats and parliamentarians and indirect activities such as media campaigns and mobilizations of members. Different strategies of influence are correlated positively, hence, there is no contradiction between pursuing strategies associated with insider access to decision-making and strategies where pressure is put on decision makers through media contacts and mobilizations. An analysis of four distinct strategies - an administrative, a parliamentary, a media and a mobilization strategy - finds interesting variations in the factors that affect the pursuance of the various strategies of influence. Groups with a privileged position vis-a-vis decision makers have high levels of activities targeting these decision makers, but the lack of a privileged position does not lead groups to pursue indirect strategies. Indirect strategies are most intensively pursued by cause groups and groups who find themselves in a competitive situation with regard to attracting members.

AB This paper focuses on factors that have contributed to the persistence of forced child begging in Senegal. It interprets from a socio-cultural perspective the evolution and acceptance of an unremitting social phenomenon where talibes or Muslim child disciples beg on the streets of a now metropolitan Senegal. In seeking to highlight the fundamental causes of forced child begging, this paper draws on fieldwork and interviews with religious leaders, NGO representatives and Senegalese citizens. The paper then argues that there are four vital factors at the root of the perpetuation of the issue in question: parental motivation; the concept of alms giving; the lack of collaboration among various advocacy groups; and the lack of communication between government officials and religious leaders. These factors in their breadth allow for a macroscopic and exploratory analysis of the phenomenon of forced child begging and the implications of the problems it poses for the current state of Senegalese society. Finally, the paper aims to highlight how proposed solutions of engaging in forthright conversations about the controversial nature of the practice along with consolidating earnest efforts to put an end to it, can help lead to the termination of what has emerged as a modern human rights tragedy.

AB Alternative media has typically defied the status quo both in journalistic practice and in ways that challenge commonly held tenets of press ethics. Unicorn Riot's alternative coverage of the 2020 social justice protests marked a milestone in decentralized, street-level storytelling shattering norms of both journalistic production and digital modes of publication, in the process renewing public and academic discourse on journalistic principles. This study argues that Unicorn Riot's unique brand of alternative media can function as a form of activist journalism capable of meeting the urgent needs of the 2020 protests through methods liberated from comparatively restrictive, and in some cases moribund, journalistic storytelling forms and production practices. IndyMedia, a network of alternative news organizations, has faded in visibility given its reliance on free labor and its non-compliance with government entities. Unicorn Riot's production practice, which relies on hours-long livestreaming video featuring interviews with protesters and community members rather than government officials, prompts reconsideration of digital journalism principles of objectivity and citizen journalism while bringing new meaning to the role of advocacy in activist reporting. Interpretive critical analysis of media texts suggests several core principles of journalism have been preserved, transformed, and/or threatened in the example of Unicorn Riot.

AB Background: Low levels of physical activity (PA) and fitness have long been a government concern in Canada; however, more than half of adults are inactive. This article examines factors influencing policy development and implementation using Canadian PA policy as a case study. Methods: Current and historical PA policy documents were amassed from a literature review, audit of government and non government websites and from requests to government officials in each jurisdiction directly responsible for PA. These were analyzed to determine policy content, results, barriers, and success factors. Results: The national focus for PA policy in Canada has devolved to a multilevel system that meets most established criteria for successful strategies. Earlier PA targets have been met; however, the prevalence of PA decreased from 2005 to 2007. Annual per capita savings in health care associated with achieving the earlier target is estimated at $6.15 per capita, yet a fraction of that is directed to promoting PA. Conclusion: Evidenced-based strategies that address multiple policy agendas using sector-specific approaches are needed. Sustained high-level commitment is required; advocacy grounded in metrics and science is needed to increase the profile of the issue and increase the commitments to PA policies in Canada and internationally.

AB Objective To assess government actions to improve the healthiness of food environments in New Zealand, based on the healthy food environment policy index.
   Methods A panel of 52 public health experts rated the extent of government implementation against international best practice for 42 indicators of food environment policy and infrastructure support. Their ratings were informed by documented evidence, validated by government officials and international benchmarks.
   Findings There was a high level of implementation for some indicators: providing ingredient lists and nutrient declarations and regulating health claims on packaged foods; transparency in policy development; monitoring prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and monitoring risk factors for noncommunicable diseases. There was very little, if any implementation of the following indicators: restrictions on unhealthy food marketing to children; fiscal and food retail policies and protection of national food environments within trade agreements. Interrater reliability was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.76-0.79). Based on the implementation gaps, the experts recommended 34 actions, and prioritized seven of these.
   Conclusion The healthy food environment policy index provides a useful set of indicators that can focus attention on where government action is needed. It is anticipated that this policy index will increase accountability of governments, stimulate government action and support civil society advocacy efforts.

ID SELF-REGULATION; ADVERTISEMENTS; DRINKING; EXPOSURE; INDUSTRY
AB Aims This case study identifies the influence and mechanisms that the alcohol industry in Brazil has been able to bring to bear to maintain self-regulation in the marketing of beer and many wines set against a trend of increasing alcohol consumption in Brazil, particularly among young people and women. It identifies the forms of power and strategies used by the alcohol industry in Brazil that may be useful for other countries to consider in seeking to move from self-regulation to state regulation of alcohol marketing. Method A review was conducted of recent legal documents and court cases, as well as the activities of alcoholic beverage industries. Results Because of an exemption, Brazilian law had established that both beer and many wines are not alcoholic beverages for marketing purposes. These beverages are subjected to industry self-regulation codes. Research shows that beer and wine marketing often violates industry codes, with little or no enforcement of penalties for non-compliance. Attempts to include beer and wine in the legal definition of alcohol have been opposed by the alcohol industry, and the courts have delegated responsibility to the legislature. The recent legal activities surrounding alcohol sales during the 2014 World Cup games in Brazil provide evidence of the alcohol industry's influence on the legislative process. Conclusion The alcohol industry in Brazil plays a significant role in the formulation of public policies on alcohol, especially regarding the regulation of marketing. This power is exercised by strong lobbying of government officials responsible for public policies.

AB In Canada, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is licensed and recommended for females and males. Although all Canadian jurisdictions fund school-based HPV vaccine programs for girls, only six jurisdictions fund school-based HPV vaccination for boys. The research aimed to analyze the factors that underpin government decisions to fund HPV vaccine for boys using a theoretical policy model, Kingdon's Multiple Streams framework. This approach assesses policy development by examining three concurrent, but independent, streams that guide analysis: Problem Stream, Policy Stream, and Politics Stream. Analysis from the Problem Stream highlights that males are affected by HPV-related diseases and are involved in transmitting HPV infection to their sexual partners. Policy Stream analysis makes clear that while the inclusion of males in HPV vaccine programs is suitable, equitable, and acceptable; there is debate regarding cost-effectiveness. Politics Stream analysis identifies the perspectives of six different stakeholder groups and highlights the contribution of government officials at the provincial and territorial level. Kingdon's Multiple Streams framework helps clarify the opportunities and barriers for HPV vaccine policy change. This analysis identified that the interpretation of cost-effectiveness models and advocacy of stakeholders such as citizen-advocates and HPV-affected politicians have been particularly important in galvanizing policy change.

AB Public choice submits that legal changes can be endogenous in such a way that they are manipulated by bureaucrats who want to maximize rents from transactions with various interest groups. This paper takes the change in exchange rate regimes to empirically examine the premise. It offers a two-stage method, in which we first show that the exchange rate is influenced by interest group pressures, and subsequently that the 1990 market average regime (MAR), as a phase-in policy in Korea, was introduced mainly to serve bureaucratic incentives. This method is expected to be useful to a host of countries for various studies attempting to test a possible existence of bureaucratic or other hidden motivations behind any "isolated'' event of policy change.

DE Bombay Natural History Society; Conservation Biology; India; Indian
   Forestry Service; Indira Gandhi; Project Tiger; Smithsonian Institution
AB The implementation of Project Tiger in India, 1973-1974, was justly hailed as a triumph of international environmental advocacy. It occurred as a growing number of conservation-oriented biologists were beginning to argue forcefully for scientically managed conservation of species and ecosystems - the same scientists who would, by the mid-1980s, call themselves conservation biologists. Although India accepted international funds to implement Project Tiger, it strictly limited research posts to Government of India Foresters, against the protests of Indian and US biologists who hoped to conduct the scientic studies that would lead to better management and thus more effective conservation of the tiger. The foresters were not trained to conduct research, and in fact did not produce any of significance for the first 15 years of Project Tiger's existence. The failure of biologists to gain access to India's tigers in the 1970s was caused by many factors, but not least among them was a history of disdain among conservation-oriented biologists for government officials managing reserves, and the local politics of conservation. Project Tiger, then, serves as a case study for the discussion of the intersection of conservation biology with non-scientific concerns, including nationalism and the desire of the Indian government to more completely control its land.

ID CHALLENGES; REFORM
AB Background: The financing function within a health system is considered inherently complex, so it is of utmost importance to design a suitable future for this system given uncertainties and complexities of the environment. With regard to the current and future complicated conditions, health system financing is also likely to succeed if it can anticipate the impacts of effective factors in the future and further plan appropriate interventions ahead of time. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop scenarios for the health system financing in Iran. Methods: This mixed-design research of exploratory future studies type was conducted using the scenario method. In this respect, the key variables were evaluated using a questionnaire from two aspects of importance and uncertainty as well as formation of a future studies group (focus group). Finally, sensitivity analysis was carried out through cross-impact balance (CIB) analysis using the Scenario Wizard (Version 4.31) software. Results: A total of 25 factors were selected based on the type and the position of the variables (driving force, bi-dimensional, risk, secondary leverage or modifiable-to-secondary leverage) over the diameter of the MICMAC chart. Considering the degree of significance and uncertainty, eight variables including all four driving force variables (oil sales and economic blockade, leadership and advocacy, bureaucracy and corruption, and possibility of using information technology in providing services), as well as the variables of resource sustainability, natural disasters, regional security, and specialization culture were chosen. Then, five variables were finalized as the key changes that would create the scenario based on sensitivity analysis and final expert opinions. According to the defined conditions, 270 scenarios were developed, of which fourteen scenarios were identified as poorly adaptable and five cases as highly adaptable. Conclusion: The best scenario identified in this study based on the degree of adaptation included the use of massive technology and oil sales, mediocre economic conditions with high probability of occurrence, strong leadership and advocacy, high regional security, as well as bureaucracy and low corruption with medium probability of occurrence.

SO ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Medicare cost-containment efforts have uniformly led to a reduction in physician reimbursement offset by increasing administrative burdens and costs and complicating delivery of care. Surgeons who face decreasing compensation for Medicare patients may be forced to limit the number of these patients for whom they care. Decreasing physician reimbursement from Medicare typically translates into a similar reduction by private payers. Administrators who come at a cost have yet to show proven value. All of this translates into limiting our ability to care for patients. We are facing a critical moment for potential change prompted by a global health crisis, a new administration, a new legislature, and an increased appreciation for health care delivery among the American public. As physicians, we need to be active participants in changing the system, placing a greater priority on delivering optimal care at optimal cost. We should use this moment when the American public is focused on the need for health care to reprioritize Medicare funding and physician reimbursement while urging reductions of government spending on bureaucracy. This requires actively lobbying lawmakers and speaking collectively.

AB Efforts to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of public services by harnessing the self-interest of professionals in state agencies have been widely debated in the recent literature on welfare state reform. In the context of social services, one way in which British policy-makers have sought to effect such changes has been through the "new community care" of the 1990 NHS and Community Care Act. Key to this is the concept of care management, in which the identification of needs and the provision of services are separated, purportedly with a view to improving advocacy, choice and quality for service users. This paper uses data from a wide-ranging qualitative study of access to social care for older people to examine the success of the policy in these terms, with specific reference to its attempts to harness the rational self-interest of professionals. While care management removes one potential conflict of interests by separating commissioning and provision, the responsibility of social care professionals to comply with organizational priorities conflicts with their role of advocacy for their clients, a tension rendered all the more problematic by the perceived inadequacy of funding. Moreover, the bureaucracy of the care management process itself further negates the approach's supposedly client-centred ethos.

AB Various reforms at the federal level have led bureaucracies, including arts councils, to design and implement performance measurement systems. We still know very little about whether performance measurement has any influence on the external conditions of arts councils, or whether it serves as policy rhetoric for arts advocacy. In this article, we seek to understand the answers to these questions by conducting a case study of performance measurement at the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). We conclude that there is little evidence that performance measurement at the NEA has had any appreciable effects on agency appropriation levels. Therefore, as a policy response to federally mandated performance measurement systems, arts councils might do better in focusing exclusively on metrics that capture internal efficiency, as opposed to those that serve to demonstrate performance to external constituencies.

AB This article examines the tangible needs and external stressors experienced by Chinese American families with a member living with schizophrenia, in the context of a six-month pilot study of family psychoeducation. Therapists' notes from 117 family and group sessions were analyzed. The families expressed concerns regarding housing, finance, work, study, and the shortage of bilingual psychosocial services. Interacting with government offices and social services agencies caused anxiety and frustration, partly due to the high stakes involved given their low socioeconomic status, and partly due to the bureaucracy. As immigrants, study participants had needs for language translation, knowledge about resources, and advocacy by case managers. This study also highlights the importance of interventions beyond the micro individual level to the mezzo and macro levels, where changes in organizations and policies are necessary.

AB This paper uses Anderson's notion of 'imagined community' to argue that how people think about the publicness of their school system provides insight into the functioning and flourishing of communities, societies and nations. We focus on the privatisation of public schooling in Alberta, Canada and Northern England to highlight tensions between the provision of public schooling today and a romanticised, historical imagining of the public school providing equality and emancipation for all. We use data collected from 47 semi-structured interviews of education bureaucrats, union officials, school personnel and advocacy group members that asked about what constitutes 'publicness' within their system. Our analysis shows a tension between the realities of public systems opened up through market-oriented policies of 'autonomous' provision and stakeholders who still strongly believed in a public school system that was in the service of society, rather than the more individualist orientation of school choice and autonomy imaginaries.

ID POLICY; PARTNERSHIPS
AB Rural governance has drawn considerable attention from both local government officials and scholars in the United States since the early 1990s. It is touted as a way to mitigate the limitations of the traditional government unit-based approaches to problem solving and decision making and to foster partnerships across both jurisdictional boundaries and sectors (public, private, and nonprofit). Established in 1962, the Resource Conservation and Development (rc&d) program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides a unique model of rural regional governance. Acting as a coalition of governments, private businesses, individuals, and interest groups, the rc&d program provides the flexibility needed to deal with issues at the appropriate spatial scale. It incorporates aspects of both grassroots and governmental organizations and can bring together local interests and expertise with governmental policy and support in service provision, problem solving, and economic development. The approach does not necessarily entail loss of power on the part of the state, but it does provide a mechanism for local people to exercise their agency, to tackle their problems, and to decide which elements of their lives they want to sustain.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION-AGENCY; RULEMAKING
AB Amidst congressional gridlock, administrative rulemaking is the main pathway for environmental policy making. Scholars have assessed the role of the institutions of government (the president, Congress, and the courts) and key interest groups (i.e., business and environmental interests) in shaping rulemaking outcomes. What is missing from this literature is an assessment of the role of key implementers, state environmental agencies. This research fills this gap by assessing the role and impact of state government agencies in three case studies of rulemaking at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Based on original interviews and a public comment analysis, this research suggests that state agencies play an active and influential role in EPA rulemaking. And, in some cases, state agencies wield more influence than other interest groups. Interviewees argued that this influence stems from these agencies' unique voice as an implementation collaborator. As a result, researchers should incorporate an assessment of the role of these interests to more effectively explain regulatory outcomes at the EPA and potentially across the bureaucracy.

TI "In A Race All Their Own": The Quest to Make Mexicans Ineligible for US
   Citizenship
SO PACIFIC HISTORICAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID MISCEGENATION LAW; POLICY
AB This article traces challenges to Mexicans' legal and racial status by various groups, including federal bureaucrats, nativist organizations, and everyday citizens. Early twentieth-century efforts to make Mexicans ineligible for U. S. citizenship, despite provisions in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, focused on the premise that Mexicans were neither "black" nor "white"; interest groups and politicians both strove instead to categorize Mexicans as "Indian." These efforts intensified after the 1924 Immigration Act and two Supreme Court decisions, Ozawa v. United States (1922) and United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (1923), which declared Japanese and Asian Indians ineligible for citizenship because they were not white. Underlying U. S. efforts to resolve Mexican immigration and citizenship issues was the ongoing problem of determining who could be considered white; this concern clashed with positive Mexican understandings of mestizaje.

AB Agricultural public investments in developing countries can have substantial effects on performance in the sector and beyond. In the examination of actual resource allocation decisions by governments and donors, it is striking that strong evidence of the high economic contributions of particular types of public investments seems to coexist with a relative neglect of these public goods provisions in budget portfolios, and vice versa. This article sets out to understand this incongruence, by examining the political economy drivers of public expenditure allocation and composition. It reviews theories and empirical investigations on how (i) the incentives and constraints of key actors including politicians, bureaucrats, interest groups and donors, (ii) the characteristics of publicly provided goods and services and (iii) country-wide political governance environments affect the prioritisation of public investments.

AB Forest policy implementation is a political endeavor involving both state and non-state actors. We observe that civil society organizations (CSOs) often federate into civil society-led coalitions (CSCs) in order to shape forest policies in their favor. They appear to be successful in doing this during the policy design phase but we know little about whether they are able to see through to implementation the changes they have put in motion. Analyzing CSC strategies during policy implementation could help to explain variation in the extent to which forest policies are successfully implemented. This paper analyzes the strategy choices and potential impact during policy implementation of a loose CSC comprised of CSOs, activists, people's movements, researchers, and lawyers that advocates for the full implementation of the Forest Rights Act in India. Drawing from the Advocacy Coalition Framework's focus on belief systems, complemented by insights from political ecology and civil society/social movements literature, we develop a framework to analyze CSC strategy choices. Our analysis is conducted at the national level and in two states, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. We employ qualitative research methods, including 38 interviews with CSC and non-CSC members, and a comprehensive analysis of the main CSC listsery and 1000 relevant English language newspaper articles. Our study reveals that the CSC employs a range of conflictive and collaborative strategies in its attempts to influence state-led implementation processes, at both national and state levels. It draws on a loose, heterogeneous network with ability to connect internally and a clear moral justification of its involvement in FRA implementation. However the diverse range of views on the implementation issues held by CSC members, lack of dedicated funding for coordination, limited legitimacy in the eyes of some state actors and a constricting wider institutional setting, impedes the CSC's ability to make coalition-level strategy decisions. Our results lead us to argue that CSCs are undoubtedly active in forest policy implementation at the national level and in the two states analyzed, though limited coordination of strategies potentially restricts their impact on the policy implementation process.

AB Finland promoted a value-based agenda as the President of the European Union (EU) Council in 2019. The focus was especially on the defence of the rule of law principle. A role as a strong value promoter departs from the pragmatic and cautious tradition of Finnish EU policy. In this article, I will ask why Finland chose to promote values, and what kind of political debate preceded its Presidency term. Second, I will look at the actual promotion of the common values during the Presidency. Third, I will provide some evaluations of the success of Finland's value-based approach. The analysis draws from comprehensive documentary sources related to Finnish EU policy and her Presidency term, and from 33 semi-structured research interviews among the key Finnish politicians, civil servants and civil society organization representatives in 2020. The article shows that values were thoroughly debated before the term and their relevance increased as the Presidency approached. Finland also succeeded in promoting several values, especially by linking them to practical questions. The article argues that evaluating the success of Finland's approach is more contentious, which may be tackled several ways.

LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGED CARE BACKLASH; HEALTH-CARE; PERCEPTIONS; POLITICS; MEDIA
AB Organized medicine has battled the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) since the 1970s over enforcement of the antitrust laws. Physicians' discontent stems from the belief that federal policy allows managed care organizations to achieve dominance in health care markets just as it discourages physicians from taking collective action to protect their interests. This article examines two important efforts by organized medicine over a twenty-year interval to alter federal antitrust policy. In 1982, physicians and other professionals sought a special exemption from FTC jurisdiction; beginning in 1998, physicians promoted legislation that would exempt independent practitioners from the antitrust laws for collective bargaining purposes. Both initiatives passed in the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate. This article uses an advocacy coalition framework to reinterpret the events and to assess the reasons for legislative failure. The evidence suggests that in both instances, although twenty years apart, consumer groups and federal bureaucrats determined the outcome in favor of corporate medicine.

AB An estimated 90% of births or more in the United States will be screened for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) by the end of 2014. Europe has made less progress despite providing the population-based studies that were critical in driving support for efforts within the United States. Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) advocacy groups, investigators in screening for CCHD and international health organizations have been meeting with health care providers and government officials on a country by country basis. Countries that are implementing or have pilot projects have been identified to track global implementation.
   The Nordic countries, the United States, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates are closest to universal screening for CCHD in newborns. Significant pilot projects tailored to unique care delivery systems screen through the use of midwives in the Netherlands, on maternity wards in the United Kingdom and while developing newborn care infrastructure in China. In Africa, South and Central America, individual countries are in the early stages of organization.
   Screening for CCHD is spreading across the globe. Early recognition has the ability to improve care in countries providing CHD treatment and prepare parents for adverse events in countries where care is not accessible. Impact of screening in regions with less access to intervention will be important to track. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID POLITICAL-ECONOMY; FRAMEWORK; KATRINA
AB In this paper, we take a Public Choice perspective to identify and categorise barriers to efficient public climate adaptation. Specifically, we distinguish three dimensions of public adaptation: extent, structure (form and timing) and organisation (coordination across territorial authorities and policy fields). Within each of these dimensions, we investigate how the self-interest of voters, pressure groups, bureaucrats and politicians may bias adaptation decisions. Thus, we indicate specific barriers to efficient public adaptation. Based on this framework, we illustrate how Germany's response to major flood disasters reflects the incentive structure of concerned stakeholders and their political interaction. The ad hoc character of some public adaptation measures implies a clear bias from the efficient benchmark. In conclusion, we argue that the propositions of Public Choice theory shed some light on how empirical public adaptation processes unfold.

AB Background Among the many barriers to evidence use in decision-making, weak capacity for evidence use has attracted a lot of focus in the last decade. The study aims to inform and enrich ongoing and future efforts to strengthen capacity for evidence use by presenting and discussing the experiences and lessons of a project implemented in Kenya and Malawi to strengthen individual and institutional capacity for evidence use within the ministries of health (MoHs). Methods This paper draws on the internal and external evaluations of a 3-year project funded by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the Strengthening Capacity to Use Research Evidence in Health Policy (SECURE Health). To strengthen individual capacity, the project implemented a training and mentorship programme for 60 mid-level policy-makers in the two MoHs. To strengthen institutional capacity, the project conducted sustained advocacy with top leaders to strengthen structures that enable evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM), supported Kenya to develop research-for-health policies and priorities, supported Malawi to review the implementation of its health research agenda, developed EIDM guidelines for both MoHs, and supported bi-annual evidence dialogues to improve interactions and raise the profile of evidence. Internal evaluation included baseline and endline surveys (93 baseline and 92 endline interviews), 60 in-depth interviews, and intervention-specific evaluations (pre-post tests for training workshops, feedback forms for policy dialogues and tracking effects of advocacy efforts). The external evaluation was implemented alongside project implementation, conducting three annual evaluations. Results The results show that training and mentorship programmes in EIDM were effective in improving competencies of civil servants. However, such programmes need to train a critical mass to be effective in enhancing EIDM practice at the MoHs. On strengthening institutional capacity for EIDM, while the project achieved some success, it did not realise long-lasting effects because of its limited time of implementation and limited focus on sustained political economy analysis, which meant that the intervention was negatively affected by frequently changing interests within the MoHs. Conclusions Although training and mentorship are effective in improving EIDM competencies, they need to be incorporated in existing pre-service and in-service training programmes for sustainability. Strengthening institutional capacity for evidence use is complex and needs sustained political commitment and long-term investments.

AB Since the 1980s, many developing countries have enacted policies of decentralization to create localized, representative forms of government. A highly under-studied body of local governance are village development committees (VDCs). Utilizing a mixed-method approach in three districts of Southern Malawi, we combine surveys, focus groups, and interviews to examine the role of VDCs in local politics. Selected by their peers, VDC members navigate a complicated landscape including: local and central politicians, government bureaucrats, NGOs and special interest groups, and traditional authorities. We find that citizens are accurately able to evaluate the development work that VDCs are doing and consistently rate their trust in these institutions higher than their trust in elected authorities. Still, challenges persist: members receive no standardized training and there are consistent gender gaps in the experiences of men and women members of the VDCs.

TI Peacebuilding through non-formal education programmes: a case study from
   Karamoja, Uganda
SO INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING
LA English
DT Article
ID POLITICS; PEACE
AB Experts increasingly refer to the crucial role of education in cultivating processes of sustainable peacebuilding in conflict-affected environments. While peacebuilding interventions have slowly started to place emphasis on aspects of equality or service delivery in formal education systems, the potential of non-formal education (NFE) programmes to foster social transformation in conflict-affected environments often remains unexploited. There is little research examining how NFE can affect the security situation and peace process in a conflict-affected region, or the role it plays in peacebuilding at large. To address these questions, the article draws on the case study of the Alternative Basic Education Karamoja (ABEK) programme in Uganda. It is based on a multi-track data collection strategy involving visits to learning centres, focus group discussions and interviews with government officials, teachers, youth, civil society organizations and other stakeholders over a period of three months in 2015. The study finds that, despite persistent implementation challenges, ABEK proved to (a) be relevant to the security and conflict conditions in the region; and (b) overcome structural and indirect forms of violence through alternative and flexible modes of education. The ABEK case therefore gives rise to much wider peacebuilding implications and formal education sector planning in conflict-affected environments.

DT Article
DE framing; media; LGBT pride marches; Russia; Saint Petersburg
ID TELEVISION; MOVEMENTS; FRAME; NEWS
AB This article analyses media representations of LGBT social movements, taking the case of Saint Petersburg LGBT pride parades. The analysis is developed through the use of framing theory, which views the media as an arena where interest groups promote their own interpretations of particular issues. Frames juxtapose elements of the text in such a way as to provide the audience with a scheme within which to perceive the message. Social movements are viewed as interest groups that introduce new frames in public debate. Two types of frames can be distinguished: collective action frames and status quo frames. In this study, the usage of two collective action frames (equality frame and victim frame), and two status quo frames (morality frame and propaganda promoting homosexuality frame) were examined. Additionally, the sources of quotes used in news stories were analyzed. The study focuses on articles dedicated to Saint Petersburg LGBT pride marches in the years 2010-2017 in the most popular local Internet websites. The analysis shows that the coverage of LGBT pride marches can be divided into two distinct periods: 2010-2013 and 2014-2017. In the first period, LGBT activists dominated the coverage, quoted about twice as much as government officials. Equality and victim frames were prevalent. In the second period, activists were cited significantly less often, with the propaganda promoting homosexuality frame dominating the discourse. However, contrary to findings of previous studies on social movement representation, across the whole period under consideration, LGBT activists were quoted more often than government representatives. This finding calls for a further exploration of the conditions which allowed for such coverage in the context of political heterosexism and homophobia.

AB In 2003 the policy development process in Bosnia and Herzegovina was characterised by international community (IC) dominance. The IC provided the vast majority of the analysis of problems facing the country and drafted many of the laws. This article documents developments from fall 2003 to fall 2006 in the use of evidence and analysis in the policy development process and the role of local policy research organisations (PROs-often called think tanks) in it. The likely relation between these changes and the activities of a PRO mentoring project that operated over the same period is also assessed. Evidence comes as a series of interviews in both years with government officials and members of parliament, on the one hand, and leaders of PROs and advocacy NGOs on the other. The broad picture that emerges from the above review is of a substantial positive development in the policy development process in Bosnia and Herzegovina over the period. Factual evidence and analysis are playing a much greater role, and PROs have been a major provider of this information. The evidence indicates that PROs have been successful in convincing the policy community that they are purveyors of objective, disinterested advice and analysis. The improvements occurred in a conducive environment that steadily placed greater responsibility for policy formation on Bosnian officials. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Powerful corporations leverage the law to shape the regulatory environments in which they operate. A key strategy for achieving this is litigation. I ask under what conditions corporations litigate, and specifically, what happens when two repeat players, transnational agribusiness firms and local governments, face each other in court. I compare outcomes of two cases-Hawaii and Arica, Chile-documenting how different sociopolitical contexts and legal systems shape how actors engage the law. Interviews with firm managers, unions, government officials, lawyers, and advocacy organization leaders and document analysis reveal that firms seize on existing institutional norms and politics to define their localized legal strategies. Through strategic legalism, a defensive legal strategy that is outcome-oriented and context-specific, firms accomplish legal compliance and political containment of their opposition. In Hawaii, firms rely on preemptive legality, a strategy that moves controversial issues like pesticide safety from one domain of democratic politics to another that is largely incontestable because it is preempted by a higher authority. In Chile, firms use authoritarian legality, an approach that draws on authoritarian structures and policies within the state, to sway legal outcomes. These cases reveal the mechanisms that corporations draw on to institutionalize their power advantages through the law, offering a typology for future scholars to better understand how the strategic behavior of corporations shapes regulatory outcomes.

   Germany
AB At the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was publicly excluded from the European 'civilizing mission'. The victorious Allies stripped Germany of its overseas empire. The German colonies were awarded to other imperial powers as mandates under the League of Nations. This action was justified by citing colonial atrocities, such as the German campaign against the Herero, which were used to label Germans as 'exceptionally cruel colonial masters' and 'unfit imperialists'. Yet, during the tenure of the League's mandate system, several former German colonial officials rose to prominence in the League of Nations as 'imperial experts'. The involvement of German colonial officials in League agencies and events suggests that, although no longer part of an imperial power and officially ostracized from the 'work of civilization', Germans remained adaptive contributors to international discourses on empire. In order to determine how individual Germans and lobbying interests were able to make use of the spirit of internationalism to minimize their association with 'unfit imperialists' and re-establish themselves as 'fellow civilizers', this paper focuses on the interwar careers and interactions of two colonial officials: Dr Ludwig Kastl and Dr Julius Ruppel-former bureaucrats who had served in the African colonies, each of whom became German members on the PMC.

DE opioid availability; oral morphine; India; developing countries;
   palliative care; pain relief; drug regulation
AB In India, a million people with cancer and an unknown number of people with other incurable and disabling diseases, need opioids for pain relief. Only about 0.4 % of the population in need have access to them. Major barriers to access to opioids are complicated regulations and problems related to attitude and knowledge regarding pain relief and opioids among professionals and the public. The Pain and Policy Studies Group at Madison Wisconsin has been collaborating with many Indian palliative care workers and government officials to improve availability of opioids to those who need them for pain relief. As a result of this collaborative effort, the Government of India asked all state governments to modify the narcotic regulations following a model given to them. To facilitate the process, the collaboration has conducted workshops in 13 states in association with local champions. Currently, 13 states in India and one union territory have simplified regulations, but opioid availability has improved only in a minority of these states. Establishment of simple standard operating procedures to implement the simplified regulations, advocacy, and improved education of professionals are essential for further improvement of the situation. The past decade has demonstrated that government policy can be changed if palliative care enthusiasts work in tandem with the government. The progress has been slow, but real and encouraging.

DE central government; cutbacks; decision-making; Estonia; retrenchment
ID FISCAL CRISIS; RESPONSES
AB The article investigates the Estonian government's response to the fiscal crisis by looking at the dynamics of the decision-making processes during cutback management from 2008 to 2013 from the dichotomy of centralization-decentralization. The study explores the cutback decision-making by pinpointing the main actors and contextual variables shedding light on the management of fiscal crisis. It is demonstrated that, in general, the fiscal crisis contributed to increasing levels of centralization in governmental decision-making. The crisis decision-making was dominated by centralized political decisions and non-inclusion of the opposition and interest groups. Still, achieving urgent solutions was facilitated by decentralized decisions at the ministerial level, the empowerment of budgetary institutions and the intensive engagement of the civil servants. It has been indicated that the initially short-term procedures to enable cuts and resultant changes in decision-making processes are mostly in effect still in 2014 and thereby influence public administration practices in the long run. Points for practitioners The study shows that cutback management may lead to urgency in governmental decision-making, where centralization facilitates quick decisions. It is also demonstrated that a minority government is able to achieve fiscal adjustment even in a context of high political conflict. The crisis context sets new requirements to the competencies of public servants, as cutback management obliges them to cope with new and very complicated tasks. The article indicates that short-term cuts and changes in decision-making processes intended to alleviate the acute phase of crisis may remain in effect considerably longer than initially planned and thereby influence public administration practices in the long run.

AB Societal well-being is challenged by the complexity and intangibility of the compromises inherent in digital exchanges. Increasingly these exchanges rely on technology, with competing priorities that challenge cooperation and communication among key parties involved. The authors examine the factors that drive tensions between consumers and organizations in digital exchanges, as well as how and why interest groups, lawmakers, and bureaucrats (also known as the "iron triangle") try to mediate these exchanges through policy and regulation. By explicating the nature of these relationships, the authors illustrate various trade-offs faced by all parties and depict a novel, comprehensive framework to facilitate holistic assessment of the factors underlying these ubiquitous but complex digital relationships with vague ethical stewardship. This framework serves as a lens to help guide business and regulatory policymaking and as a platform for identifying future research opportunities.

Tanzania has strong national policies and implementation plans to strengthen multisectoral nutrition (MSN) governance, yet local actors must transcend sector silos to fully implement MSN actions in communities.

Methods An initial "Learning Exchange" workshop gathered input from nutrition staff in 5 regions and invited their participation in mentoring and supporting MSN collaboration. Regional Nutrition Officers piloted action teams in their districts, supporting District Nutrition Officers to create teams of 3-4 officers from relevant sectors (agriculture, community development, health, education) to plan and implement community-based activities consistent with sector priorities and national policy. To learn from stakeholder experiences, longitudinal data were collected through individual semistructured interviews and documentation of activities; 27 officers were interviewed 1-4 times over 14 mo. Results Four districts successfully created action teams that bridged communication gaps between administrators and implementors; made progress on advocacy, collaboration, and budgeting for nutrition; and initiated MSN implementation in communities. Participants identified strategies to overcome challenges to cross-sector collaboration including heavy workloads and limited resources and supervisor buy-in. Based on their experiences and innovations in creating MSN action teams, stakeholders shared valuable recommendations for peer learning across sectors to scale up MSN collaboration. Officers' presentation of insights to regional and district leaders buoyed interest in MSN action teams as a feasible and acceptable approach to strengthen local governance and implementation to improve child nutrition. Conclusions Experience-based input from government officers engaged in novel community and intersectoral collaborations provided actionable guidance for putting national MSN policy into practice and leveraging the capacity of implementation staff.
   In a participatory study, peer mentoring and formation of action teams helped overcome challenges to intersectoral collaboration and enhanced motivation and advocacy for community implementation of national multisectoral nutrition policies.

TI Alcohol Industry Arguments for Liberalizing Alcohol Policy in Finland:
   Analysis of Twitter Data
SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the arguments used by the alcohol industry and actors aligning with it as a lobbying strategy on Twitter to influence the reform of the Finnish alcohol law during its preparation phase between 2014 and 2017, when the original purpose of the law reform was changed from reducing alcohol-related harm to liberalizing alcohol policy. Method: Primary data were collected on Twitter between 2014 and 2017 from six alcohol industry actors (n = 1,085 tweets). The Twitter data were analyzed by coding using Microsoft Excel and by content and thematic analyses using a modified version of the European Centre for Monitoring Alcohol Marketing's (2011) seven key messages of the alcohol industry. Results: The findings identified three main arguments used on Twitter by the alcohol industry and actors aligning with it, namely: (1) application of liberal alcohol policies generates more revenue, (2) liberties should be generally prioritized above bureaucracy and control, and (3) education about responsibility is the best solution to alcohol-related problems. Conclusions: Social media applications such as Twitter offer the alcohol industry unlimited opportunities for promoting its traditional public relations arguments.

   PUNISHMENT; POLITICS; CONTEXT; CRIME
AB Under forfeiture laws, law enforcement organizations seize billions of dollars a year from U.S. citizens based on demonstrated or suspected connections between the assets and criminal activity. Interest groups have argued that taking of assets through forfeiture intentionally and disproportionately targets communities of color, but scholars have not sufficiently explored this relationship. In order to address this gap, we draw on racial threat theory to develop the expectation that the growth of black and Hispanic populations within a community will correlate positively with the amount of asset forfeiture, and representative bureaucracy theory to develop the hypothesis that greater representation of a particular minority group on the police force will negatively moderate that relationship. We test these hypotheses in an analysis of 2,278 municipal police departments between 1993 and 2007, finding evidence of a significant relationship between minority population share and reported forfeiture revenue. Furthermore, we find that increasing the proportion of black and Hispanic officers negatively moderates that relationship. We believe the results have implications not only for the U.S., but also for other nations with asset forfeiture regimes and more broadly for our understanding of the ways in which law enforcement organizations respond to diverse populations and the moderating impact of representation on those responses.

ID BINGE DRINKING; CONSUMPTION; METAANALYSIS; RISK; UNIT
AB Background: Excessive alcohol consumption has significant adverse economic, social, and health outcomes. Recent estimates suggest that the annual economic costs of alcohol in Australia are up to AUD $36 billion. Policies influencing price have been demonstrated to be very effective in reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms. Interest in minimum pricing has gained traction in recent years. However, there has been little research investigating the level of support for the public interest case of minimum pricing in Australia.
   Objective: This article describes protocol for a study exploring Western Australian (WA) public knowledge, understanding, and reaction to a proposed minimum price policy per standard drink.
   Methods: The study will employ a qualitative methodological design. Participants will be recruited from a wide variety of backgrounds, including ethnic minorities, blue and white collar workers, unemployed, students, and elderly/retired populations to participate in focus groups. Focus group participants will be asked about their knowledge of, and initial reactions to, the proposed policy and encouraged to discuss how such a proposal may affect their own alcohol use and alcohol consumption at the population level. Participants will also be asked to discuss potential avenues for increasing acceptability of the policy. The focus groups will adopt a semi-structured, open-ended approach guided by a question schedule. The schedule will be based on feedback from pilot samples, previous research, and a steering group comprising experts in alcohol policy and pricing.
   Results: The study is expected to take approximately 14 months to complete.
   Conclusions: The findings will be of considerable interest and relevance to government officials, policy makers, researchers, advocacy groups, alcohol retail and licensed establishments and organizations, city and town planners, police, and other stakeholder organizations.

DT Article
DE Mauritius; tobacco control; ideas; institutions; interests
ID SMOKING; CONFLICT; CAMPAIGN; FAMILY
AB Context: This article explains the policy process that occasioned the development of comprehensive tobacco control policies in Mauritius from 1980 to 2019. It does so by drawing theoretical insights from John Kingdon's streams framework, historical institutionalism, and ideational perspectives to explicate how tobacco control rose to the status of government policy agenda.
   Methods: The main sources of data are government documents, media reports, archival studies, grey literature, and published books and articles. These sources were supplemented by key informant interviews with government officials, civil society groups, and other vested interest groups.
   Findings: This article finds that the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases in the late 1980s, the political commitment of Mauritius's Labour government to comprehensive tobacco control, the institutional legacies of Mauritius's Public Health Act of 1925, and the administrative capacity of Mauritius's Ministry of Health and Quality of Life are the primary factors that drove tobacco control policies in Mauritius.
   Conclusion: The findings from this study will enrich our understanding of policy change and the politics of tobacco control in the global south. Future research should investigate why some countries in Africa have failed to adopt comprehensive tobacco control policies despite ratifying the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

AB The article presents the methodology used in building a panel of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the National Policy for the Integrative Health of the Black Population (PNSIPN). The methodology was developed in four stages: scenario identification, implementation context, PNSIPN indicators and validation of the indicators. The proponents of the policy, street-level bureaucrats, technical advisors of the collegiate representing the managers, representatives of social movements, of associations and forums of pathologies participated in every stage. Those actors identified and agreed on the panel's indicators, which have been categorized into indicators of coping with racism; indicators of sociodemographic conditions according to gender, age and race/color; and indicators of morbidity and mortality according to gender, age and race/color. The indicator panel for monitoring and evaluating the PNSIPN implementation is feasible and can be used at municipal, state and federal levels, possibly subsidizing the implementation process and enabling the improvement of management. The methodology contributes to the identification of indicators for public policies aimed at guaranteeing human rights, rights surveillance and advocacy.

DE Transitional economy; NTBFs growth; qualitative comparative analysis
ID TECHNOLOGY-BASED FIRMS
AB The NTBFs have attracted growing interest from most of the transitional economies as they are seen as an important source of greater value added creation while being characterised with higher rate of return on capital. Shedding light on the growth determinants of new technology-based firms not only helps managers to accomplish organisational goals but also assists policymakers in devising effective strategies. The role of individual, organisational as well as environmental factors in the development of the new technology-based firms has been separately addressed by many researchers. The simultaneity of these factors leads to diverse configurations, each of which envisaging different growth paths for the firm. The aim of this paper is to identify the growth paths for the new technology-based firms. To this end, Some interviews were conducted with the managers of the developed new technology-based firms in Iran (as a transitional economy) and the key themes governing the growth pattern of this group of firms have been identified using the thematic analysis, while possible growth paths for these firms were established by means of qualitative comparative analysis. The designed questionnaires were distributed among 22 developed firms and 8 underdeveloped firms for the period 2013-2015 and the obtained data were analysed using the FSQCA software, which led us to the development of dominant growth path for new technology-based firms. Based on the findings of this paper and factors affecting the growth of firms, two growth paths are suggested for the new technology-based firms, of which the one with greater role for government is more likely to take place. Communication with government officials and lobbying groups in the field of science and technology as the key customer in transitional economies is critical to the corporate growth, which has been identified as a sufficient condition for this research.

AB Flood Early Warning Systems (FEWS) are implemented in many parts of the world, but early warnings do not always translate into an emergency response from all individuals at risk. This article examines challenges such as warning communication and community response capabilities. Literature review, global online survey results, and experiential knowledge helped identify cross-cutting issues such as failure to use participatory approaches involving communities and addressing their concerns in warning, insufficient preparedness and response levels of FEWS, inadequate translation of disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies into action at the community level, lack of DRR knowledge and practices among key stakeholders, insufficient gender and social inclusion in all stages of FEWS, gaps in institutional communication and collaboration, and, finally, technical and financial constraints. The paper also discusses the contribution of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in addressing the identified challenges and eventually strengthening FEWS locally. CSOs were found to act positively at local level challenges and significantly contribute to addressing them through tailored solutions to community concerns. Such solutions include DRR awareness campaigns to educate the communities and key officials; enhanced communication between vulnerable communities and local authorities; transforming reactive community response that relied on government officials to a risk-informed and self-prepared community response; gender inclusion and diversity in various stages of FEWS; and advocacy campaigns to build resilience to disasters. Eventually, policy-based recommendations that can help to root out the challenges discussed in this study are presented.

Though this development attracts economic gain for the companies and surrounding areas, low-income and predominantly Black communities bear the brunt of the environmental consequences while frequently remaining stagnant economically. This qualitative, community-based participatory research study grew out of a larger study designed to recruit lay community advisors from communities labeled as hard to reach in research. We focus on Holt, Alabama, an unincorporated community in the southeastern United States region. The primary goal of this research inquiry is to thematically analyze community interviews stemming from a topic of research, practice, and policy interest to community members: the effects of industrial pollution on Holt citizens' daily lives. Content analysis of focus-group transcripts revealed four emergent themes, including: (1) how the pollution affects their water, soil, and air quality; (2) illness related to pollution; (3) community engagement and empowerment; and (4) suggestions regarding what government officials could do to address this area of need. Building upon the prior research regarding environmental justice, human flourishing, and the definition of nurturing environments, suggestions are made regarding the creation, implementation, and maintenance of project advisory councils focused on issues of environmental justice. Community advocacy and empowerment as well as community and scientific partnerships are imperative to alleviate problems associated with environmental justice.

DT Article
DE Russia; import of institutions; deposit guarantee; demand for law;
   banks; interest group; state paternalism
ID BANK RUNS; INSURANCE; DISCIPLINE
AB The article sheds light on the circumstances preceding the enactment of explicit deposit insurance in Russia in December 2003. It may help to understand the subsequent performance of this institution. The author relies on available banking statistics as well as qualitative information of different natures. The formal deposit guarantee emerged in countries with advanced market economies and financial systems in the absence of state-owned banks. In Russia, a small group of politicians and experts started promoting deposit insurance since 1993. The main interest groups, such as core deposit-taking banks and their depositors, presented little demand for law in this domain. The advantages of an explicit scheme were unclear in the Russian context because the bulk of household deposits were kept in a state-owned savings bank. Material conditions were not mature in the 1990s: the government was financially weak, market economy institutions were missing, and the banking sector embraced many improper players. Deposit guarantee was incapable of addressing the main concern of the households, namely how to recover the savings lost due to hyperinflation in the early 1990s. The author assumes that the champions of deposit guarantee in Russia were driven by a combination of motivations: idealism and good intentions influenced by the experiences of the United States and other countries, or the "demonstration effect"; the desire to disrupt the monopoly of Sberbank and boost the competitiveness of privately-owned commercial banks in order to boost bank competition, just for the sake of it; and the search for a new field of activity for a certain clan of civil servants and politicians. The conclusion is that subjective factors were the ones underpinning the debate around deposit insurance law.

AB Input-driven agriculture has led to an epidemic of impoverishment, farmer suicides, and environmental degradation in India, but has also shown consistent staying power in Indian politics. We examine the case of organic farming policy adoption to explore this paradox. Specifically, our objective was to evaluate how the state-wide Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) program (now formally known as Community Managed Natural Farming) in Andhra Pradesh, India came to be. Evidence was drawn from government documents, field notes from a ZBNF workshop and farmer interactions, and in-depth interviews with stakeholders. Results suggest that advocacy of civil society networks, champions within the bureaucracy, emphasis on rural livelihoods, and the 20-year history of consensus building around agroecology all played a key role in the adoption of the ZBNF program in this state. Given the possibility of scaling up ZBNF at the national level, our analysis of the enabling environment is especially timely.

TI The Industrial Development Authority, 1949-58: establishment, evolution
   and expansion of influence
SO IRISH HISTORICAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Established in 1949 in the face of Fianna Fail hostility, and greeted with suspicion by both the department of Industry and Commerce and the department of Finance, the Industrial Development Authority within ten years had carved out a powerful position for itself within the bureaucracy. By the early 1950s, while Sean Lemass was still wedded to the concept of import-substituting industrialisation, the I.D.A. was formulating its vision for 'industrialisation by invitation' and lobbying internally for the introduction of export profits tax relief The adoption of this measure in 1956 initiated the low corporation-tax regime that remains in place to this day. Though frequently conflated, the reorientation of industrial policy in the 1950s and the dismantling of tariff barriers in the 1960s were quite separate initiatives. That the establishment of the I.D.A. and the adoption of export profits tax relief were opposed by the department of Finance and enacted by inter-party governments clearly distinguishes them from the later trade-liberalisation initiative associated with the partnership of T.K Whitaker and Lemass. The present paper explores the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the I.D.A. and traces its evolution and expanding influence over the first ten years of its existence.

TI Policy entrepreneurship and policy networks in healthcare systems - the
   case of Israel's pediatric dentistry reform
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Policy entrepreneurs; Policy networks; Policy change; Pediatric
   dentistry reform
ID EXPERIENCE; STATE
AB Background: Can the entry of a policy entrepreneur challenge the equilibrium of a policy network and promote changes that might clash with the goals of powerful civil-servants and/or interest groups and, if so, why and how? Our goal is to examine two sides of the same coin: how does an in-depth analysis of Israel's dental care reform enrich our understanding of policy networks and policy entrepreneurship? Second, how does the literature on policy networks and policy entrepreneurship help us understand this reform? Based on a theoretical framework that appears in the literature of policy entrepreneurship and policy networks, we analyze the motivations, goals and strategies of the main actors involved in the process of reforming pediatric dental care in Israel. We demonstrate how a policy entrepreneur navigated within a policy network and managed to promote a reform that, until his appearance, no one else in that network had succeeded in enacting.
   Methods: Our goals are advanced through a case study of a reform in pediatric dentistry implemented in Israel in 2010. It rests on textual analyses of the literature, reports, committee minutes, parliamentary proceedings, print and online media, and updates in relevant legislation and case law between 2009 and 2015. In addition, the case study draws on the insights of one of the authors (TH), who played a role in the reform process.
   Results: Historical circumstances and the Israeli public's longstanding lack of interest in changing the existing model as well as interest groups that preferred the dominance of the private sector in the dental healthcare system kept that area out of the services supplied, universally, under the National Health Insurance Law. This situation changed significantly following the publication in 2007 of a policy analysis that contributed to shifts in the motivations and balance of power within the policy network, which in turn prepared the ground for a policy change. In this environment a determined policy entrepreneur, who identified a window of opportunity, took the lead and instituted an innovative and far-reaching reform.
   Conclusions: A policy entrepreneur can leverage external factors as well as the previous activities of a policy network that has already matured to create a policy change. Such entrepreneurial activity includes maneuvering around opponents and overcoming resistance from various stakeholders.

AB Aims: To explore how policy actors attempted to deliberately frame public debate around alcohol minimum unit pricing (MUP) in the UK by comparing and contrasting their constructions of the policy in public (newspapers), semi-public (evidence submissions) and private (interviews). Methods: Content analysis was conducted on articles published in ten national newspapers between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2012. Newsprint data were contrasted with alcohol policy documents, evidence submissions to the Scottish Parliament's Health and Sport Committee and 36 confidential interviews with policy stakeholders (academics, advocates, industry representatives, politicians and civil servants). Findings: A range of policy actors exerted influence both directly (through Parliamentary institutions and political representatives) and indirectly through the mass media. Policy actors were acutely aware of mass media's importance in shaping public opinion and used it tactically to influence policy. They often framed messages in subtly different ways, depending on target audiences. In general, newspapers presented the policy debate in a "balanced'' way, but this arguably over-represented hostile perspective and suggested greater disagreement around the evidence base than is the case. Conclusions: The roles of policy actors vary between public and policy spheres, and how messages are communicated in policy debates depends on perceived strategic advantage.

AB BackgroundIndonesia shoulders a significant tobacco burden, with almost two million cases of tobacco-related illnesses and more than two hundred thousand tobacco-related deaths annually. Indonesian tobacco control is progressing but lags behind other countries. Our study evaluates factors that contribute to the slow progress of tobacco policy change in Indonesia from the perspective of tobacco control experts (TCEs).MethodWe conducted qualitative interviews with four international and ten national TCEs, who have been active in tobacco control for at least 5years. Our interview guideline included questions on the current tobacco control situation in Indonesia and explored reasons why tobacco control is progressing so slowly. The interviews were conducted either in English or Bahasa Indonesia, recorded and then transcribed verbatim. We conducted a thematic analysis based on five core causal factors for policy adoption: institutions, networks, socio-economic factors, agendas and ideas.ResultsThe multistage delay of tobacco policy adoption is principally due to political structures and policy hierarchy, complex bureaucracy, unclear roles and responsibilities, and a high degree of corruption. The low bargaining position and lack of respect for the Ministry of Health also contributes. There are contrasting frames of tobacco as a strategic economic asset and tobacco control as a sovereignty threat. There is an imbalance of power and influence between well entrenched and resourced tobacco industry networks compared to relatively young and less established tobacco control networks. The policy agenda is likely influenced by the privileged position of tobacco in Indonesia as a socially acceptable product with high consumption. There are constraints on transferring ideas and evidence to successful policy adoption.ConclusionTobacco companies have substantially influenced both policy decisions and public perceptions, signifying a power imbalance within the government system and broader networks. Acceding to and enforcing the World Health Organization- Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO-FCTC) would enable the Indonesian government to shift the power imbalance towards public health stakeholders. Tobacco control advocates must enhance their network cohesion and embrace other community groups to improve engagement and communication with policymakers.

TI Why Hasn't Democracy Slowed Rising Inequality?
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; UNITED-STATES; POLARIZATION; POLITICS
AB During the past two generations, democratic forms have coexisted with massive increases in economic inequality in the United States and many other advanced democracies. Moreover, these new inequalities have primarily benefited the top 1 percent and even the top .01 percent. These groups seem sufficiently small that economic inequality could be held in check by political equality in the form of "one person, one vote." In this paper, we explore five possible reasons why the US political system has failed to counterbalance rising inequality. First, both Republicans and many Democrats have experienced an ideological shift toward acceptance of a form of free market capitalism that offers less support for government provision of transfers, lower marginal tax rates for those with high incomes, and deregulation of a number of industries. Second, immigration and low turnout of the poor have combined to make the distribution of voters more weighted to high incomes than is the distribution of households. Third, rising real income and wealth has made a larger fraction of the population less attracted to turning to government for social insurance. Fourth, the rich have been able to use their resources to influence electoral, legislative, and regulatory processes through campaign contributions, lobbying, and revolving door employment of politicians and bureaucrats. Fifth, the political process is distorted by institutions that reduce the accountability of elected officials to the majority and hampered by institutions that combine with political polarization to create policy gridlock.

AB Does the partisanship of officeholders affect environmental outcomes? The popular perception is that Republicans are bad for the environment, but complicating factors like federalism may limit this outcome. Using a dataset that tracks toxic releases over 20 years, we examine how partisan control of executive and legislative branches at both state and federal levels affect environmental policy. Moving beyond the passage of policies or environmental program spending allows us to fully understand the impact of Republicans on the environment. In addition, we take into account structural complications that may shape the relationship between Republican control and environmental outcomes. We find that the conventional wisdom that Republicans are bad for the environment has some validity, but it is dependent on what offices Republican elected officials occupy. More specifically, Republicans significantly affect toxic chemical releases when occupying governorships and controlling Congress. Our conclusions provide further insight into understanding how partisanship affects environmental outcomes, including how partisanship composition across the federal system matters.

AB Context Inclusion of people who use mental health services in policymaking is a goal of many mental health systems. However, the outcomes of such involvement have not been well articulated or researched.
   Objectives The objectives of this research were to explore how the social and personal outcomes of citizen-user involvement in mental health policymaking were conceptualized by policy actors and to create a conceptual framework to guide the development and evaluation of citizen-user involvement.
   Design This qualitative instrumental case study explored the phenomenon of citizen-user involvement using the policy field of mental health and social housing policy in the Province of Manitoba, Canada, as the focal case.
   Participants A total of 21 informants from four policy actor groups, citizen-users, representatives of advocacy organizations, government officials and service providers, participated in key informant interviews. Data also included policy documents relevant to the policy field.
   Analysis Data collected from interviews and policy documents were analysed using an inductive qualitative paradigm.
   Results Participants identified multiple outcomes of citizen-user involvement in policymaking. The resulting conceptual framework illustrated how outcomes in personal, substantive, instrumental and normative dimensions influence micro-, meso-and macro-social structures. The results also provided a cautionary tale by suggesting how attention needs to be paid to managing the risks as well as optimizing the rewards of involvement.
   Conclusions The framework has application in guiding the development and evaluation of mechanisms that aim to involve citizen-users in policymaking. The framework encourages an approach that takes into account the complexity and multidimensional nature of engaging citizen-users.

   monetarism; rules versus discretion
ID INTERNATIONAL REGIMES; INSTITUTIONALISM; POLITICS; POWER
AB This article reassesses the neo-liberal shift within British economic policy-making and the international political economy, focusing especially the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1960s. The IMF has always used the conditions attached to its lending to try and shape borrower's policy; here we explore the evolving content of that conditionality and the economic ideas underpinning it. Using recently released IMF records, as well as other archives, we argue that the negotiations between the IMF and the UK Government in the 1960s can be seen as part of the Fund's drive towards a crucial change from discretionary to rules-based approaches to macroeconomic policy making. This drive took place within a struggle over a specific policy instrument, domestic credit expansion (DCE), at that time regarded as an important measure of monetary policy. The article locates the IMF advocacy of DCE within an attempt by the Fund to constrain discretionary policy-making through increasingly specific and binding rules. In response, UK Government officials began to pre-empt and even deceive the Fund to avoid being tied down. Our analysis unpacks which neo-liberal economic ideas the Fund embraced, noting its rejection of monetarism. In the period charted here (1965-69), the rules-based regime remained compatible with Keynesianism. However, the UK Government's grudging acceptance of this approach provided a crucial condition of possibility for a significant qualitative shift in macroeconomic policy-making when rules later became infused with an increasingly neo-liberal character.

AB BACKGROUND: Past disasters have highlighted the need to prepare for subsets of critically ill, medically fragile patients. These special patient populations require focused disaster planning that will address their medical needs throughout the event to prevent clinical deterioration. The suggestions in this article are important for all who are involved in large-scale disasters or pandemics with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including frontline clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials.
   METHODS: Key questions regarding the care of critically ill or injured special populations during disasters or pandemics were identified, and a systematic literature review (1985-2013) was performed. No studies of sufficient quality were identified. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process. The panel did not include pediatrics as a separate special population because pediatrics issues are embedded in each consensus document.
   RESULTS: Fourteen suggestions were formulated regarding the care of critically ill and injured patients from special populations during pandemics and disasters. The suggestions cover the following areas: defining special populations for mass critical care, special population planning, planning for access to regionalized service for special populations, triage and resource allocation of special populations, therapeutic considerations, and crisis standards of care for special populations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Chronically ill, technologically dependent, and complex critically ill patients present a unique challenge to preparing and implementing mass critical care. There are, however, unique opportunities to engage patients, primary physicians, advocacy groups, and professional organizations to lessen the impact of disaster on these special populations.

AB Legal protections for people living with HIV (PLHIV) are important for protecting human rights, yet little research has examined how laws translate into awareness and understanding for key populations. The Philippines has recently revised their legal protections for PLHIV in response to its growing HIV epidemic, where HIV-positive gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men bear the majority of cases. We present findings from interviews with 21 HIV-positive gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Manila, Philippines regarding awareness, understanding, and needs regarding HIV-specific legal protections at the time just before new revisions to the omnibus HIV law were passed. Overall, there was no standardized way participants became aware of legal protections; few became aware through healthcare providers, while most learned through online resources, social media, and advocacy organizations. However, even after learning about HIV-specific legal protections, many found the law too complex to understand or did not understand how to use such protections. This led participants to preemptively take action to avoid HIV-related discrimination, even if they were protected by law. Participants demonstrated a strong desire for interventions and policies to improve legal awareness and understanding for PLHIV, government officials, and private businesses. This research demonstrates the value of increasing awareness and understanding in policy-specific interventions designed to improve quality of life for PLHIV. Interventions centered around legal protections are currently underdeveloped, providing a strong opportunity to integrate such interventions in existing practice or as stand-alone tools to decrease perceived stigmatization.

AB This article investigates causes of the legislative choice to mobilize private litigants to enforce statutes. It specifies the statutory mechanism, grounded in economic incentives, that Congress uses to do so, and presents a theoretical framework for understanding how certain characteristics of separation of powers structures, particularly conflict between Congress and the president over control of the bureaucracy, drive legislative production of this mechanism. Using new and original historical data, the article presents the first empirical model of the legislative choice to mobilize private litigants, covering the years 1887 to 2004. The findings provide robust support for the proposition that interbranch conflict between Congress and the president is a powerful cause of congressional enactment of incentives to mobilize private litigants. Higher risk of electoral losses by the majority party, Democratic control of Congress, and demand by issue-oriented interest groups are also significant predictors of congressional enactment of such incentives.

AB Global market integration over the past three decades has led to labour market restructuring in most countries around the world. Employment flexibility has been emphasized as a way for employers to restructure their organizations to remain globally competitive. This flexibility has resulted in the growth of precarious employment, which has been exacerbated by the global financial crisis and resulting recession in 2007/2008, and the ongoing economic uncertainty throughout much of the world. Precarious employment may result in short and long-term health consequences for many workers. This presents a deeper and more structural determinant of health than what health promoters have traditionally considered. It calls for a different understanding of workplace health promotion research and intervention that goes beyond enabling healthier lifestyle choices or advocating safer workplace conditions to ensuring adequate social protection floors that provide people with sufficient resources to lead healthy lives, and for advocacy for taxation justice to finance such protection.

DT Review
ID TITLE-VII; ACT; ENFORCEMENT; AWARDS; COURT
AB In lobbying for the job discrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1964, liberal civil rights advocates wanted an administrative job discrimination enforcement regime modeled on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), with no private lawsuits. Pivotal conservative Republicans, empowered by a divided Democratic Party and the filibuster in the Senate, defeated, an administrative framework and provided instead for private law-suits with incentives for enforcement, including attorney's fees for winning plaintiffs. They were motivated by native suspicion toward bureaucratic regulation of business in general, as well as fear that they would not be able to control an NLRB-style civil fights agency in the hands of their ideological adversaries. In the political environment of 1963-64, some meaningful enforcement provisions were necessary, and to conservative Republicans private litigation was preferable to public bureaucracy effects.
   This choice had important self-reinforcing policy feedback effects. Civil rights advocates were initially optimistic about agency implementation and skeptical about the efficacy of private litigation to enforce Title VII, even with attorney's fees for winning plaintiffs. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, civil rights advocates observed an agency lacking the material resources and political will and commitment to carry out its mission. At the same time, they observed levels. of private enforcement that far exceeded their expectations, as well as courts inclined toward broadly proplaintiff interpretations of Title VII. The CRA of 1964's attorney's fees provisions also had the effect of contributing fund to civil rights groups that prosecuted lawsuits and of conjuring into being a private, for-profit bar to litigate civil rights claims in general, and job discrimination claims in particular. These developments drove a transformation in the enforcement preferences of civil rights groups toward private litigation, weakening their historic support for administrative implementation. Working together with the burgeoning,for-profit civil rights bar, they mobilized to expand the fee-shifting provisions of the CRA of 1964 across the entire field of civil rights, which they accomplished by successfully lobbying for enactment of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976. Thus was created the modern civil rights enforcement framework.

AB Former politicians produce political memoirs for a variety of reasons, many of which are self-serving. However, given that active politicians who aspire to emulate or at least learn from the example of their predecessors often read political memoirs, we need to understand how these books conceptualise the policy process. In this article, I argue that political memoirs are a manifestation of their author's (mis)conceptions of the policy process itself. Adopting the Hawke Government's Taxation Summit of 1985 as a case study, I comparatively analysed the way that six political memoirs and autobiographies account for that policy process, examining the varying significance that each author ascribes to policymaking agents, chiefly the leadership, the executive, the bureaucracy, the intra-party factions, and external community interest groups. I conclude that memoirs are conditioned by genre conventions, and by their author's specific vantage point within the policy network.

AB Aim: This study explored factors that shaped the development of Australia's Health Star Rating system for front-of-pack labelling (FoPL) on packaged foods and whether insights could be drawn from this experience to inform the development of global FoPL standards.
   Methods: Ten individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with public health or consumer advocates, academics in the field of nutrition labelling and policy, a food industry employee, and Australian public servants. Thematic analysis was undertaken, guided by Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework, to identify factors which shaped Australian and international FoPL policy processes.
   Results: Senior Australian bureaucrats played the policy entrepreneur role to facilitate the development of the Health Star Rating system. The public health and consumer advocacy groups formed an alliance to counter-balance the influence of the food industry in the Health Star Rating development process. Public health and consumer groups have less influence at Codex Alimentarius, where policy-making is constrained by political alliances and consensus voting structures.
   Conclusions: Strong leadership, policy entrepreneurship and a coherent alliance between public health and consumer groups enabled the development of a FoPL system in Australia and could contribute to advancing FoPL standards at the international level.

DE narrative inquiry; resistance narrative; ex-centricity; labyrinth; art
   education
AB This article stems from a story of arts education advocacy in the midst of a bureaucracy that misunderstood the purpose of art education at the launch of a new elementary school. Contemporary visual arts education practices overlap a unique period of change in neighboring social science disciplines, a turn of the tide that involves the embrace of narrative methods to rewrite prevailing working models and paradigms of social science practice. Here at the start of the 21(st) century, art education continues to be practiced in the thrall of a scientific paradigm that misunderstands the greater potential of the arts in education, often imposing a ceiling ill-fitted for arts praxis, arts-based research, or arts pedagogy. The author argues that art education is also at a turn of the tide and surmises some of the unexpected outcomes when new and ex-centric stories of learning and a "pedagogy of possibility" are more thoroughly explored, allowing practitioners to fully rethink an art education practice without taxonomic ceilings and within the shelter of the unexplored labyrinth.

SO THESIS ELEVEN
LA English

DE adivasi; dams; developmentalism; India; nationalism; rivers; social
   movements
AB In the 1990s, social movements against large dams in India were celebrated for crafting a powerful challenge to dominant policies of development. These grounded struggles were acclaimed for their critique of capitalist industrialization and their advocacy for an alternative model of socially just and ecologically sustainable development. Twenty years later, as large dams continue to be built, their critics have shifted the battle off the streets to new arenas - to courts and government committees, in particular - and switched to a techno-managerial discourse of maintaining river health. What accounts for this change? This article traces the trajectory of cultural politics around Indian rivers within the larger imagination of the nation, the rise of economic liberalization and Hindu nationalism, and the emergence of environmental bureaucracies. It argues that, alongside being shaped by this context, current anti-dam campaigns also contend with the legacy of earlier social movements, their gains as well as losses. This political field has narrowed the potential for radical critique, large-scale collective mobilization and, ultimately, keeping rivers alive.

AB This article explores general practitioners' (GPs) persuasive efforts in cases where biomedical evidence is absent but expected. Health insurance in Western countries is based on the biomedical ideal that legitimate complaints should have objective causes detectable by medical examination. For GPs responsible for assessing sickness and incapacity for work, the demand for objective evidence can be problematic: what if they as experts deem that a patient is in fact sick and eligible for benefits, but are unable to provide objective evidence to that fact? How can they convince bureaucrats in the insurance system to accept their judgment? Taking 'medically unexplained symptoms' as my case, I draw on focus group and follow-up interviews with GPs in Norway to explore how GPs attempt to persuade bureaucrats to accept their professional judgment. Proposing the concept of 'rhetorical work', I reconstruct a typology of such work that doctors engage in to influence bureaucratic decision-making and provide long-term health benefits for patients. I then discuss the potential societal implications of GPs' rhetorical practices and the applications of the concept of rhetorical work in future research.

DE Paul Dessau; dissidence; Hanns Eisler; German Democratic Republic;
   socialist realism
AB Both communist party officials and western observers have typically interpreted the composition of modernist music in the Eastern Bloc as an act of dissidence. Yet in the German Democratic Republic ( GDR), the most consequential arguments in favor of modernism came from socialists and party members. Their advocacy of modernism challenged official socialist realist doctrine, but they shared with party bureaucrats the conviction that music ought to contribute to the development of socialist society. Such efforts to reform musical life from a Marxist-Leninist standpoint were typical of the first generation of East Germany's intelligentsia, who saw socialist rule as the only guarantee against the reemergence of German fascism. Two of East Germany's most prominent composers, Hanns Eisler and Paul Dessau, routinely used the twelve-tone method in works carrying an explicitly socialist text. During preparations for the 1964 Music Congress, aesthetician Gunter Mayer drew from Eisler's Lenin Requiem and Dessau's Appell der Arbeiterklasse to argue that modernist techniques were highly appropriate for giving expression to contemporary social conditions. The efforts of these socialists to reconcile modernist techniques with their understanding of socialism undermine basic divisions between communism and capitalism, complicity and dissent, and socialist realism and western modernism.

TI Media influence on Herceptin subsidization in Australia: application of

   CHEMOTHERAPY; BENEFITS; DISEASE
AB Background In August 2006, the Australian government announced that Herceptin (Trastuzumab) would be added to the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of government-subsidized drugs, for treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy of HER2 breast cancer. Following initial reticence, the health minister responded to a campaign by patients and patient advocacy groups by announcing PBS subsidization which lowered the cost of a weekly dose from A$1000 to A$30. The cost to the government would be A$470 million over three years for treatment of an estimated 2100 women annually.
   Design We analysed the news frames used in all direct and attributed statements (n=239) in television news coverage of the discourse preceding the Herceptin decision by the Australian government.
   Setting Five Sydney free-to-air channels between October 2005 and August 2006.
   Main outcome measures News frames or themes.
   Results Of five news frames identified, one ('desperate, sick women in double jeopardy because of callous government/incompetent bureaucracy') accounted for 54% of all reported statements. Government financial parsimony was framed as responsible for the women's plight, with drug industry pricing never mentioned. Claimed benefits of Herceptin often conflated cancer non-recurrence and survival and favoured quantification rhetoric which emphasized percentage increases in improvement rather than the more modest increases in absolute survival.
   Conclusions News frames invoking key tenets of the 'rule of rescue' dominated television discourse on Herceptin. Clinicians, patients, their families and patient advocacy groups invoking the rule of rescue can increase the likelihood of achieving their objective of gaining access to expensive healthcare such as pharmaceuticals. Rational, criteria-based public health policy will find it hard to resist the rule of rescue imperative.

AB The outbreak of livestock diseases in Sub-Saharan African countries is the most critical challenge affecting the development potential of the livestock sector. Vaccination campaigns are one of the most important strategies to deal with this challenge. However, such campaigns are difficult to implement due to major governance challenges, such as delays in the procurement of vaccines and the disbursement of funds. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of these governance challenges, based on a case study of a Livestock Development Animal Health Project in Zambia. The goal was to examine in detail why these problems occur and how they are linked to the implementation procedure. A novel qualitative research tool called Process Net-Map, which is a visual participatory mapping technique was applied. The tool made it possible to develop an understanding of the exact implementation mechanism and to identify the different actors involved, including government officials, private sector companies, and farmers. The study revealed that the complex design of the procurement procedure, the limited capacity of the procuring entity, and a lack of urgency among the actors involved, resulted in the procurement delays. The findings also indicate that the delay in the release of funds arises because of a diversion of funds. Some strategies to improve the efficiency of the procurement process were identified, such as increasing the sense of urgency, building staff capacity, using e-procurement and entering into framework contracts with suppliers. Building sustainable financial capacity in the overall management of public funds seems essential to deal with the challenge of fund diversion. Use of Citizen Report Cards and lobbying political decision markers are some of the mechanisms that farmers can employ to increase their capacity to hold the animal health service providers accountable and demand better services. The problems identified are not only relevant for vaccination programs but are general implementation challenges encountered in developmental programs that involve the distribution of publicly procured inputs.

DT Article
ID PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY
AB Background: The Active Living by Design project based in Seattle (Active Seattle) advocated for policies and projects in diverse communities supporting a more walkable city, while using social marketing and education to get more people walking more often.
   Intervention: Walking audits were carried out in select diverse neighborhoods, resulting in recommendations for policy change and built-environment improvements. Advocacy for city-scale policies also occurred. Walking maps and other social-marketing products promoted behavior change. Major Safe Routes to School activities occurred and were made possible by separate funding sources.
   Results: Positive results of Active Seattle included an increase in funding for pedestrian infrastructure, a pedestrian master plan, a Complete Streets policy, substantial increase in Safe Routes to School activity, and institutionalization of active living and active transportation within partner agencies. Challenges included institutional prioritization for improving pedestrian infrastructure, funding inequity, and a community need that was greater than could be fulfilled.
   Lessons learned: Efforts to overcome funding inequities or other resistance to pedestrian-oriented physical projects will benefit from high-visibility campaigns that have a lasting impact on public perception and decision makers' political will. To reach vulnerable populations that have substantial barriers to increasing walking frequency, extensive staff time for outreach is needed. Changing the built environment to encourage walking may be a long-term solution in communities with diverse populations.
   Conclusions: Influencing and educating local government officials to make active living projects and policies a high budgetary priority is essential for large-scale impact and long-term change. (Am J Prev Med 2009;37(6S2):S403-S411) (C) 2009 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

TI The changing process and politics of health policy in Korea

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; CARE POLICY; REFORM; BRITAIN; SYSTEM; POWER
AB Korea recently introduced three major health care reforms: in financing (1999), pharmaceuticals (2000), and provider payment (2001). In these three reforms, new government policies merged more than 350 health insurance societies into a single payer, separated drug prescribing by physicians from dispensing by pharmacists, and attempted to introduce a new prospective payment system. This essay compares the three reforms in Korea and draws important lessons about the country's changing process and politics of health care policy. The change of government, the president's keen interest in health policy, and democratization in the public policy process toward a more pluralist context opened a policy window for reform. Civic groups played an active role in the policy process by shaping the proposals for reform-a major change from the previous policy process that was dominated by government bureaucrats. The three reforms also showed important differences in the role of interest groups. Strong Support by the rural population and labor unions contributed to the financing reform. In the pharmaceutical reform, which was a big threat to physician income, the president and civic groups succeeded in quickly setting the reform agenda; the medical profession was unable to block the adoption of the reform but their strikes influenced the content of the reform during implementation. Physician strikes also helped block the implementation of the payment reform. Future reform efforts in Korea will need to consider the political management of vested interest groups and the design of strategies for both scope and sequencing of policy reforms.

SO TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Based on a case study of the Indian intervention in Sri Lanka's ethnic war from 1987 to 1990, this article explores the conditions under which democracies can act as effective third parties to resolve civil violence. India's experience as guarantor of a peace settlement in Sri Lanka suggests that not only the intractability of civil conflicts but the power of domestic pressures shape intervention policies and outcomes. Decision-makers depend on the support of important domestic political elites - political parties, interest groups, press, and governmental bureaucracies - as well as the approval of the public who can reject them in periodic elections. In order to enforce peace settlements, third-party guarantors must have a firm sense of the belligerents' intentions and resources, sensitivity to the dynamics of the conflict, and freedom of action. At the same time, democratic leaders must consider the role of timing, the influence of internal bargaining, the importance of credible 'staying power', and personal reputation.

AB Bangladesh has a long history of species introductions from different geographic regions. The country was a major international trade route during the early-modern era and was under British colonial rule until 1947. During this time, many invasive alien species (IAS) that now threaten the country's native flora, fauna and ecosystems were inadvertently introduced. In recent years, deliberate preferences for fast-growing, high-yielding exotic species has also threatened the existence of native species in the country. Here, we provide an overview of IAS in Bangladesh, their suspected origin, the purpose of their introduction, and their impacts on ecosystems and people. Based on a literature review, we identified 69 IAS reported to occur in Bangladesh. The majority of these species were plants (46 species), followed by fish (16 species), and insects (5 species). The identified species were introduced from South America, Asia, Africa and Australia, primarily to provide food and timber. Although initially introduced to favor the productivity of food and timber, and to provide certain environmental benefits, the identified IAS are increasingly threatening native flora, fauna and ecosystems in Bangladesh. We recommend a need for appropriate policies and legislation to address the introduction, monitoring, and regulation of IAS in the country. A comprehensive list of IAS and a robust protocol to differentiate harmful from advantageous species is also necessary. Community awareness, advocacy, surveillance, capacity building of government officials, and cooperation with neighboring countries for transboundary management and monitoring of IAS is also important to minimize the risks posed by IAS in Bangladesh.

   CHILDREN
AB Both the Canadian and U.S. governments have determined that breast-fed infants are among the populations most exposed to dioxins, receiving levels of exposure orders of magnitude above those considered acceptable. In light of the political controversy associated with dioxins and the cultural significance of breast milk as a symbol of purity, one might have expected dioxin contamination of breast milk to achieve prominence on both the popular and governmental agendas. Yet as this article demonstrates, this issue has received less media and governmental attention than other environmental issues believed to present comparable or lower health risks. Consistent with recent literature on agenda denial strategies, there is some evidence that efforts by environmental groups to publicize levels of breast milk contamination have been rebuffed by government officials, physicians, and breastfeeding advocacy groups fearful that women will stop breastfeeding. However, what is more striking is just how seldom environmentalists have attempted to reframe this issue. The article argues that North American environmentalists have consciously chosen not to press the dramatic issue of breast milk contamination out of concern that mothers would discontinue breastfeeding, as well as personal anxiety about an issue that fundamentally challenges conceptions of our own bodies and our relationships with our children. Their self-restraint challenges the depiction by some authors of environmental groups as eager to capitalize on any opportunity to provoke public concern and outrage to advance their agenda. The case study also suggests that the literature on agenda setting must look beyond active strategies of agenda denial by economically and politically powerful interests, to the role of shared cultural values in shaping - and restricting - the political agenda.

AB Training and capacity building are long established critical components of global water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) policies, strategies, and programs. Expanding capacity building support for WaSH in developing countries is one of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. There are many training evaluation methods and tools available. However, training evaluations in WaSH have been infrequent, have often not utilized these methods and tools, and have lacked rigor. We developed a conceptual framework for evaluating training in WaSH by reviewing and adapting concepts from literature. Our framework includes three target outcomes: learning, individual performance, and improved programming; and two sets of influences: trainee and context factors. We applied the framework to evaluate a seven-month community-led total sanitation (CLTS) management training program delivered to 42 government officials in Kenya from September 2013 to May 2014. Trainees were given a pre-training questionnaire and were interviewed at two weeks and seven months after initial training. We qualitatively analyzed the data using our conceptual framework. The training program resulted in trainees learning the CLTS process and new skills, and improving their individual performance through application of advocacy, partnership, and supervision soft skills. The link from trainees' performance to improved programming was constrained by resource limitations and pre-existing rigidity of trainees' organizations. Training-over-time enhanced outcomes and enabled trainees to overcome constraints in their work. Training in soft skills is relevant to managing public health programs beyond WaSH. We make recommendations on how training programs can be targeted and adapted to improve outcomes. Our conceptual framework can be used as a tool both for planning and evaluating training programs in WaSH. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Simple Summary
   In regulating the trading and keeping of exotic pets, lawmakers seek to protect animal welfare, prevent species declines, and safeguard biodiversity. The public also requires protection from pet-related injuries and animal-to-human diseases. Most legislation concerning exotic pet trading and keeping involves restricting or banning problematic species, a practice known as "negative listing". However, an alternative approach adopted by some governments permits only those species that meet certain scientifically proven criteria to be sold and kept as pets. Thus, governments may "positively list" only those species that are suitable to keep in domestic settings and that do not present a disproportionate risk to people or the environment. We reviewed international, national, and regional legislation in Europe, the United States, and Canada and found that largely unpublished and often inconsistent criteria are used for the development of negative and positive lists. We also conducted online surveys of governments, which received limited responses, although telephone interviews with governments either considering or developing positive lists revealed insights regarding their interest and motivation towards positive lists. We discuss key issues raised by civil servants including the perceived advantages of positive lists and challenges they anticipate in drawing up suitable lists of species. We compare functions of negative and positive lists and offer recommendations to governments concerning the development and implementation of positive lists.
   The trading and keeping of exotic pets are associated with animal welfare, conservation, environmental protection, agricultural animal health, and public health concerns and present serious regulatory challenges to legislators and enforcers. Most legislation concerning exotic pet trading and keeping involves restricting or banning problematic species, a practice known as "negative listing". However, an alternative approach adopted by some governments permits only the keeping of animals that meet certain scientifically proven criteria as suitable in respect of species, environmental, and public health and safety protections. We conducted an evaluation of positive lists for the regulation of pet trading and keeping within the context of the more prevalent system of restricting or prohibiting species via negative lists. Our examination of international, national, and regional regulations in Europe, the United States, and Canada found that criteria used for the development of both negative and positive lists were inconsistent or non-specific. Our online surveys of governments received limited responses, although telephone interviews with officials from governments either considering or developing positive lists provided useful insights into their attitudes and motivations towards adopting positive lists. We discuss key issues raised by civil servants including perceived advantages of positive lists and anticipated challenges when developing lists of suitable species. In addition, we compare functions of negative and positive lists, and recommend key principles that we hope will be helpful to governments concerning development and implementation of regulations based on positive lists.

TI 'A free hand and ready help'? The supervision and control of elementary
   education in Staffordshire c. 1902-1914
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This article looks at the controversy surrounding the 1902 Education Act in Staffordshire, and the role of the Education Committee and its first Director, Graham Balfour, during the first ten years of the implementation of the Act. The 1902 Education Act has often been seen as a watershed in the conflict between Nonconformist and Established Church educationalists. This study shows that while religious controversy dominated the months surrounding the passing of the Act and continued to preoccupy certain interest groups for many years, the new bureaucracy created in 1902 changed the central issues in elementary education. Religious priorities were replaced by financial and organisational priorities. Balfour's success in dealing with these new priorities provided elementary education in Staffordshire with a unity and stability notably absent during the 19th century. This article assesses Balfour's perspective, the attitudes and expectations of religious and educational groups, and the reality of elementary education in Staffordshire after the implementation of the 1902 Education Act.

AB Drawing on accounts of regulatory capture in which an industry's influence activities pull regulation in its direction, apart from incentives or information, this article develops a formal model of capture as a shift in a policy-making agent's preferences, due to costly actions by the industry. One type of action is rentseeking that produces only capture, whereas the other type also improves regulatory quality by producing information that reduces policy uncertainty. The model shows how the ability to capture the agent can incentivise the interest group to produce more information. Thus, aligning an agent's preferences with a political principal's and immunising him from capture is not generally optimal; instead, the principal prefers an agent who is susceptible to capture associated with quality improvements but also initially more opposed to the group than the principal. A comparison of two Securities and Exchange Commission rulemakings illustrates the logic of the model.

   ACCOUNTABILITY; RETHINKING; POLITICS; FAILURE; BOTTOM; CHOICE
AB Born out of a Reagan-era desire to minimize regulatory costs, and not fundamentally reconsidered since its inception, the centralized review of agency rulemakings has arguably become the most important institutional feature of the regulatory state. Yet it is a puzzling feature: Although centralized review is sometimes justified on the ground it could harmonize the uncoordinated sprawl of the federal bureaucracy, the agency tasked with regulatory review, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has never embraced that role. It has instead doggedly clung to its original cost-reduction mission, justifying its function as a check on the federal bureaucracy with reference to the pervasive belief that agencies will systematically overregulate.
   This Article shows why that belief is wrong. The claim that agencies are systematically biased in favor of regulation finds little support in public choice theory, the political science literature, or elsewhere. In any event, theories predicting rampant overregulation are no more plausible than alternative theories suggesting that agencies will routinely underregulate. Even if zealous agencies captured, by powerful interest groups did characterize the regulatory state, OMB review is a curious and poorly designed counterweight. There is no reason to believe that OMBs location in the Executive Office of the President will inoculate OMB from the pathologies that afflict other agencies, and some reason to think that it will exacerbate them. As a response to these problems, we urge a reconsideration of the foundational role that centralized review should play in our regulatory state, and a revival and reconceptualization of the neglected principles of harmonization that once ostensibly animated the call for centralized review of administrative action.

ID ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; INDIA
AB The remarkable economic growth in Taiwan has sewed as a model of the developmental state as well as a source of scepticism about neoliberal policy for many less developed countries. However; since the mid-1980s Taiwan has gravitated from its previous statist model to the universally embraced 'market-orientated' restructuring. This study seeks to explain this neoliberal transition. A disaggregated approach is employed to break neoliberalism down into three distinct dimensions: market openness, fiscal austerity, and privatisation of public sector enterprises. The analysis results confirm that: (1) Taiwan's trade dependency on the USA constituted a decisive factor in the state opening its domestic market; (2) distributional politics was forged in a new but weak democracy to incorporate more interest groups in the fiscal expansion of the post-authoritarian era; and (3) the slow but increasingly steady progress of privatisation plans was influenced not by a 'back-to-the-market' idea but by the statist legacy with which bureaucrats attempted to manage public sector enterprises even after they became de jure private firms. The theoretical implications of this transition are discussed in the conclusion.

AB Many of the current problems of Czech economic transformation have their roots in the incentive structure and an in institutional environment that in the domestic enterprise sector have led decision making away from long-term productive orientation. This is the result of an intensive and non-standard mass privatization of state assets. Pressure groups, often defending the privileges of many former socialist corporations, have been dominant in shaping Czech politics, fiscal and banking policy, and in economic institutions building. The domestic private sector, which evolved mainly out of small enterpises outside of privatization schemes, has shown a high degree of viability, notwithstanding the lack of government and regulatory support, rising bureaucracy and ineffectual judiciary, It came to dominate the Czech economy at the end of the 1990s. Economic policy in the country, however, is resistant and is slow to react to the changing situation of the economy.

AB Tropical cyclones (TCs) of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) cause catastrophic loss over the coasts at the time of landfall in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. To strengthen TCs' disaster risk management works, it is obligatory to estimate their return periods and probability of occurrence. Therefore, in this study, extreme value theory has been employed for probabilistic assessment of BoB TCs' extreme wind speed. For TCs' extreme wind speed, Joint Typhoon Warning Centre data have been used for 44 years (1972-2015). The analyses exhibit that the cumulative probability of exceedance decreases from the cyclonic storms (CSs) to greater than supercyclonic storms (SupCSs) intensity. The exceedance probability of occurrence of CSs is about 99%, while it is about 15% for SupCSs and of greater intensity in the BoB. The most probable annual maxima show that at least one TC of hurricane category I (wind speed >= 64 knots) can occur every year. The return period exhibits that on an average one CS can occur once in about 0.27-years, whereas one SupCS can occur once in about 6 years in the BoB. Spatial plots of return period and probability with respect to TCs' extreme wind speed exhibit that coasts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in India and entire Bangladesh and adjacent Myanmar coast are at high risk. This study provides a unique insight into BoB coastal countries TCs' extreme wind risk. It is assumed that estimated TCs' wind speed will be useful for government officials, scientists, disaster managers, engineers, public interest groups and private sectors.

ID RIGHTS; GAY
AB The UN often plays a progressive role in challenging oppressive policies and laws globally from a human rights perspective. Since approximately 2005, there has been increased LGBTQI rights recognition within various UN bodies such as: the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Security Council, UN Women and Special Rapporteurs. Despite such achievements, these UN bodies often experience challenges in legitimising such recognition of LGBTQI individuals and communities. This paper critically analyses the effectiveness and relevance of UN bodies in addressing and advocating for progressive and equitable policies related to LGBTQI people through examination of the following: LGBTQI advocacy at the UN; internal bureaucracies of the UN and their affiliates that interfere with LGBTQI rights; and the role of member states. A critical social work lens frames the paper based on a queer liberation perspective, which is inclusive of sexual and gender diversities beyond dominant heterosexual and binaristic constructions (Mule, 2008, 2012). Such perspectives contribute to resisting and challenging norms that make static the identities, recognition and legitimisation of LGBTQI at the UN.

AB States tightly regulate access to alcohol and other substances. During the pandemic and related state of emergency, state and federal governments adopted a variety of regulations affecting this access. State shelter-in-place orders included decisions about whether liquor stores and marijuana dispensaries are essential businesses. Decisions about telehealth access to medical marijuana or treatments for substance use disorders were made at the state and federal levels. This article examines the political economy behind these decisions, focusing on deviations from the norm including Pennsylvania's decision to close state-run liquor stores. Interest groups and other political considerations help explain state and federal policy changes affecting access to alcohol and other substances.

AB The last decades have seen a remarkable expansion in the number of International Organizations (IOs) that have mainstreamed environmental issues into their policy scope-in many cases due to the pressure of civil society. We hypothesize that International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs), whose headquarters are in proximity to the headquarters of IOs, are more likely to affect IOs' expansion into the environmental domain. We test this explanation by utilizing a novel dataset on the strength of environmental global civil society in proximity to the headquarters of 76 IOs between 1950 and 2017. Three findings stand out. First, the more environmental INGOs have their secretariat in proximity to the headquarter of an IO, the more likely the IO mainstreams environmental policy. Second, proximate INGOs' contribution increases when they can rely on domestically focused NGOs in member states. Third, a pathway case reveals that proximate INGOs played an essential role in inside lobbying, outside lobbying and information provision during the campaign to mainstream environmental issues at the World Bank. However, their efforts relied to a substantial extent on the work of local NGOs on the ground.

   guidelines: a qualitative study
SO HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE WHO; guidelines; global health; implementation; research utilisation
ID PROGRESS; STIGMA; CARE
AB Background: Properly implemented evidence-based clinical and public health guidelines can improve patient outcomes. WHO has been a major contributor to guideline development, publishing more than 250 guidelines on various topics since 2008. However, well-developed guidelines can only be effective if they are adequately and appropriately implemented. Herein, we aimed to explore whether and how WHO guidelines are implemented in local contexts to inform the success of future guideline implementation.
   Methods: Seventeen interviews were carried out between March 2018 and December 2018 with WHO guideline developers, headquarter staff, and regional and country office staff. Participants were purposely sampled from a variety of WHO guidelines and snowball sampling was used to identify regional and country office staff. The deidentified transcripts were analysed through three phases of coding, using grounded theory as the analytic approach.
   Results: WHO guidelines played a variety of roles in the work of WHO at all levels. WHO officers and local government officials used WHO guidelines to influence health policy. We categorised the uses of guidelines as (1) directly changing policy, (2) justifying policy change, (3) engaging stakeholders, (4) being guarantors of legitimacy, (5) being advocacy tools, and (6) intertwining with WHO's various roles. Participants refuted the perception of the guidelines as mere lists of technical recommendations that needed to be implemented in different contexts. We found that the existence, quality and credibility, rather than the content of the guidelines, are the keys to health policy change initiatives in different local contexts.
   Conclusions: Used as a guarantor of legitimacy by policy-makers, WHO guidelines can be better positioned to influence health policy and practice change. Understanding the various roles of guidelines can help WHO developers package guidelines to optimise their effective implementation.

AB Background: Identifying unsafe abortion among the major causes of maternal deaths and respecting the rights to health of women, in 2002, the Nepali parliament liberalized abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy on request. However, enhancing women's awareness on and access to safe and legal abortion services, particularly in rural areas, remains a challenge in Nepal despite a decade of the initiation of safe abortion services.
   Methods: Between January 2011 and December 2012, an operations research study was carried out using quasi-experimental design to determine the effectiveness of engaging female community health volunteers, auxiliary nurse midwives, and nurses to provide medical abortion services from outreach health facilities to increase the accessibility and acceptability of women to medical abortion. This paper describes key components of the operations research study, key research findings, and follow-up actions that contributed to create a conducive environment and evidence in scaling up medical abortion services in rural areas of Nepal.
   Results: It was found that careful planning and implementation, continuous advocacy, and engagement of key stakeholders, including key government officials, from the planning stage of study is not only crucial for successful completion of the project but also instrumental for translating research results into action and policy change. While challenges remained at different levels, medical abortion services delivered by nurses and auxiliary nurse midwives working at rural outreach health facilities without oversight of physicians was perceived to be accessible, effective, and of good quality by the service providers and the women who received medical abortion services from these rural health facilities.
   Conclusions: This research provided further evidence and a road-map for expanding medical abortion services to rural areas by mid-level service providers in minimum clinical settings without the oversight of physicians, thus reducing complications and deaths due to unsafe abortion.

AB Engaging men and increasing their involvement as partners and parents can improve child health and development. Despite the increasing global evidence and advocacy around father involvement and caregiving, there remain few father-inclusive interventions for promoting early child health, especially within primary health systems in low- and middle-income countries. In this study, we explored community perspectives regarding fathers' roles in early child health services during the first three years of life to identify the barriers and facilitators to father involvement in Monapo District in northern, rural Mozambique. A qualitative sub-study was embedded within a qualitative intervention implementation evaluation conducted in October-November 2020. In-depth interviews were conducted with 36 caregivers, 15 health facility providers, 12 community health providers, 4 government officials, and 7 non-governmental partner organizations. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic content analysis. Results revealed that fathers were generally uninvolved in early child healthcare services. Primary barriers to fathers' involvement included the absence of fathers in many households; opportunity costs associated with fathers' accompanying children to health facilities; long waiting times at facilities; negative health provider attitudes towards fathers; and patriarchal gender norms. Respondents also highlighted facilitators of father involvement, which included fathers' broader engagement with their child at home; fathers' desires to support their partners; parental awareness about the importance of father involvement in child healthcare; and community outreach and sensitization campaigns targeting fathers directly. Our study highlights opportunities for enhancing the focus, design, and delivery of child health services so that they are more inclusive and responsive to fathers. Future research should assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of father-focused child health interventions on caregiving and early child health and development outcomes. These strategies should holistically address not only individual and household factors, but also broader structural and sociocultural determinants at the health system and community levels.

TI Labour Migration Policy in Russia: Considerations on Governmentality
SO INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
LA English
DT Article
ID IMMIGRATION; MIGRANTS
AB The authors argue that Russian migration policy reflects the functioning of contemporary Russia's entire bureaucratic machine. The bureaucracy's Soviet-era governance techniques on the one hand and the material interests of particular pressure groups on the other, shape the manipulation of immigration regulation that has occurred since the early 2000s. Therefore, attempts to liberalize migration regulation, i.e., to simplify the legalization of foreign workers, have always been incoherent, accompanied by reservations and limitations. Additionally, Russian actions are riddled with conflict between geopolitical' and domestic policy rationales. The authorities' occasional attempts to use immigration regulation as a foreign policy tool acquire primarily symbolic value in the domestic political market' rather than serving any instrumental purpose. The effort to enhance Russian influence in the post-Soviet space through the reintegration project' (Eurasian Economic Union) collides with the goal of national labour market protection, since integration entails the removal of barriers to labour movement.

AB Background: Advocacy, resources and intersubjective reasonable arguments are known as factors that contribute to smoke-free (SF) adoption and implementation in Chinese and Anglo-Saxon places. Less is known about how the implementation of smoking bans differs across European places. The aim of this qualitative comparative study is to identify and classify the SF policy implementation processes and types undertaken at the local level in seven European cities according to the views of local bureaucrats and sub-national stakeholders.
   Method: Semi -structured expert interviews (n = 56) with local decision makers and stakeholders were conducted as qualitative part of the comparative SILNE-R project in Belgium (Namur), Finland (Tampere), Germany (Hanover), the Republic of Ireland (Dublin), the Netherlands (Amersfoort), Italy (Latina), and Portugal (Coimbra). Qualitative interviews were analyzed using the framework analysis.
   Results: Implementation of SF environments predominantly focuses on indoor bans or youth-related settings. Progressive-hungry (Dublin), moderate-rational (Tampere), upper-saturated (Hanover, Amersfoort), and lower saturated (Namur, Coimbra, Latina) implementation types can be distinguished. These four types differ with regards to their engagement in enhancing SF places as well as along their level of perceived tobacco de-normalization and public smoking visibility. In all municipalities SF environments are adopted at national levels, but are differently implemented at the local level due national policy environments, enforcement strategies and the level of collaboration. Major mechanisms to expand SF regulations were found to be scientific evidence, public support, and the child protection frame. However, counter-mechanisms of closure occur if data on declining prevalence and new youth addiction trends trigger low prioritization.
   Conclusions: This study found four SF implementation types two mechanisms of progressive expansion and defensive closure. Development and enhancement of smoking bans requires a suitable national policy environment and indirect national-level support of self-governed local initiatives. Future SF policies can be enhanced by laws pertaining to places frequented by minors.

AB The aim of this article is to determine the resource potential and the importance of the new forms of organization that are LAGs in rural development on the example of the Lublin region. The paper presents the characteristics of the resource potential of the LAGs, the evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of the LAG perspective 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 and the analysis of the objectives of LAGs in terms of their impact on the processes of local and regional development on the basis of the statutes and LDSs for 2014-2020. The study used the following methods: a diagnostic survey, a document analysis, desk research. The interview was conducted in the third quarter of 2016. The study verified two hypotheses: 1) LAGs are organizations with growing resource potential and the scope of impact on the development processes of the region, especially in the area of stimulating the integration process of sectors (cross-linking); 2) bureaucracy is still the main barrier to the functioning and implementing the strategic / statutory objectives of LAGs. The assessment of the operation of LAGs in the perspective of 2014-2020, as compared to 2007-2013, indicates their growing role in influencing the processes of local and regional development. This role is reflected in the growth of the resource potential of the organisations and the high effectiveness of LAGs. LAGs insufficiently focus on creating various network links. Bureaucracy is still the main barrier to the effectiveness of achieving the objectives. In the current term, the LDS objectives seem to be the objectives common to all interest groups that constitute these organizations. The objectives formulated in LDSs enable the accomplishment of all of the assumed principles of the LEADER approach.

TI War makes the state, but not as it pleases: Homeland security and
   American anti-statism
SO SECURITY STUDIES
LA English
DT Review
ID BUREAUCRATIC POLITICS; FOREIGN-POLICY
AB The shock of war is thought to be closely associated with the growth of the state, in the United States and elsewhere. Yet each proposal to significantly expand state power in the United States since September 11 has been resisted, restrained, or even rejected outright. This outcome - theoretically unexpected and contrary to conventional wisdom - is the result of enduring aspects of America's domestic political structure: the separation of powers at the federal level between three co-equal and overlapping branches, the relative ease with which interest groups access the policy-making process, and the intensity with which executive-branch bureaucracies guard their organizational turf. These persistent aspects of U.S. political life, designed by the nation's founders to impede the concentration of state power, have substantially shaped the means by which contemporary guardians of the American state pursue "homeland security". War does make the state, but not as it pleases. Theoretical approaches to state building should recognize that domestic political institutions mediate between the international shock of war and domestic state building.

ID CRIME
AB This paper studies the link between public policy and corruption for the case of wind energy. We show that publicly subsidized renewable energy can attract criminal appetites and favor the formation of criminal associations between entrepreneurs and politicians able to influence the licensing process. The insights of a simple model of political influence by interest groups are tested empirically using Italian data for the years 1990-2007. Using a difference in difference approach we quantify the impact of a Green Certificate policy aimed at supporting renewables, and find robust evidence that criminal association activity increased more in windy provinces after the introduction of the generous policy regime. The magnitude of the effect is large: the construction of an average wind park is associated with an increase in criminal activity of 6 % in the treatment compared to the control group. Our findings show that in the presence of poor institutions, even well designed market-based policies can have an adverse impact. The analysis is relevant for countries that are generally characterized by heavy bureaucracies, weak institutions and by large renewable potential.

TI Graceful Decline? The Surprising Success of Great Power Retrenchment
SO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSITION; REPUTATION; STRATEGY; AMERICA; REALISM; PEACE
AB There is broad scholarly consensus that the relative power of the United States is declining and that this decline will have negative consequences for international politics. This pessimism is justified by the belief that great powers have few options to deal with acute relative decline. Retrenchment is seen as a hazardous policy that demoralizes allies and encourages external predation. Faced with shrinking means, great powers are thought to have few options to stave off decline short of preventive war. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, however, retrenchment is not a relatively rare and ineffective policy instrument. A comparison of eighteen cases of acute relative decline since 1870 demonstrates that great powers frequently engage in retrenchment and that retrenchment is often effective. In addition, we find that prevailing explanations overstate the importance of democracies, bureaucracies, and interest groups in inhibiting retrenchment. In fact, the rate of decline can account for both the extent and form of retrenchment, even over short periods. These arguments have important implications for power transition theories and the rise of China.

TI Indonesia: The politics of inclusion
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Much commentary on Indonesian politics since the fall of President Suharto in May 1998 has suggested that Indonesia's political system has remained just as exclusionary as it was prior to his fall, despite becoming much more democratic and decentralised. In contrast to this view, we argue that Indonesia's political system has become more inclusive, if only somewhat more so. The fall of Suharto and the subsequent process of democratisation have removed key obstacles to organisation by poor and disadvantaged groups and their NGO allies, making it easier for them to engage in collective action aimed at achieving pro-poor policy change. By making attainment of political office dependent on the support of the voting public, many of whom are poor and disadvantaged, these developments have also created an incentive for politicians to pursue policy changes that favour these groups or at least that appeal to them. At the same time, however, we argue that poor and disadvantaged groups have not become major players in the policy-making process. Despite the fall of Suharto and democratisation, these groups continue to lack the resources possessed by other participants in the policy-making process. Whereas the politico-bureaucrats and well-connected business groups have been able to exercise influence over policy by buying support within representative bodies such as parliament and mobile capital controllers, the IFIs and Western governments have been able to exercise influence by virtue of their structural power, poor and disadvantaged groups have had to rely on less potent ways of exercising influence such as holding demonstrations, engaging in lobbying activity and participating in public debates. We illustrate these points with reference to two policy issues: land reform and mining in protected forests. The article concludes by considering the future prospects for inclusive policy-making in Indonesia.

AB The authors argue that taken-for-granted notions of deservingness and legitimacy among local government officials affect funding allocations for organizations serving disadvantaged immigrants, even in politically progressive places. Analysis of Community Development Block Grant data in the San Francisco Bay Area reveals significant inequality in grants making to immigrant organizations across central cities and suburbs. With data from 142 interviews and documentary evidence, the authors elaborate how a history of continuous migration builds norms of inclusion and civic capacity for public-private partnerships. They also identify the phenomenon of suburban free riding to explain how and why suburban officials rely on central city resources to serve immigrants, but do not build and fund partnerships with immigrant organizations in their own jurisdictions. The analysis affirms the importance of distinguishing between types of immigrant destinations, but argues that scholars need to do so using a regional lens.

DE Mental health; Community groups; Participatory action inquiry; Peer
   support/involvement
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore what worked well in terms of peer involvement in a diverse network of community groups for people affected by mental health problems in Bath and North East Somerset (BANES), UK.
   Design/methodology/approach - A participatory action inquiry approach engaged the network's key stakeholders (group members, facilitators, and commissioners) in critical reflection on what supported successful groups.
   Findings - Successful groups have six characteristics: mutual support, a positive shared identity, opportunities for taking on roles, negotiated ground rules, skilled facilitation, and a conducive physical environment. Additionally, each group achieved a balance between the following areas of tension: needing ground rules but wanting to avoid bureaucracy, needing internal structure whilst also committing to group activities, balancing leadership with accountability, wanting peer leadership whilst acknowledging the burden of this responsibility, and lobbying for change in mental health services whilst acknowledging the need for support from them.
   Research limitations/implications - The evaluation shows a group's success is about adaptability and group facilitation is the art of navigating a course through these competing demands above. These insights have informed plans for a practical guide for developing peer led groups and for training of peer leaders in BANES.
   Originality/value - This evaluation focuses on self-efficacy. It draws on group members' own perceptions of what worked best for them to provide transferable learning about how peer led support groups might develop more generally. It can thus inform the growth of a comparatively new kind of community-based support for people with mental health problems and for their carers.

AB Background The traditional joint family system in a culturally diverse Pakistani society shows great respect and care for older population by the families and their generations. However, in the recent years the phenomenon of population ageing in Pakistan is rapidly increasing due to demographic shift influencing life expectancy, along with changes in socio-cultural values. This transition has resulted in institutionalization of the elderly as an emerging shelter alternative. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of the elderly people and to identify the reason which compelled them to reside in these shelter homes. Method A qualitative methodology, with a descriptive exploratory design, was adopted for the study. A purposive sample of 14 elderly males and females were selected, from two different shelter homes in Karachi, Pakistan. Semi-structured interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Content analysis was done to extract the themes and comprehend the data. Results Content analysis revealed five major themes: the circumstances of leaving home, experiences, and challenges to wellbeing before entering the care facility, coping with challenges, and decision to live in a shelter home. The analysis discovered that the elderly were experiencing lack of physical, psychological, emotional, and financial support from their family and children. It also indicated that migration of children for better career and employment opportunities, entrance of women into the workforce, and insensitive behaviour of children, left the senior citizens neglected and helpless. The findings also uncovered the challenges of unemployment and family disputes that the elderly had to face made them dependent, distressed, helpless, and lonely resulting in both their apparently willing and forceful decision to reside in shelter homes. Conclusion The findings point to need for further investigation of the identified areas in this study through qualitative and quantitative researches. There is a dire need for increasing public awareness through the social, electronic, and print media, and providing capacity building training to HCPs for the care of the elderly. The lobbying group can act as a catalyst in persuading the government officials for the execution of a policy on retirement, day care and subsidized provision of health services for the betterment of the elderly.

AB Introduction The aim of this study is to describe the barriers and facilitators to accessing low vision rehabilitation services in Massachusetts, USA, and determine differences between communities with and without existing low vision rehabilitation services for older adults with visual impairment. Method A sample of older adults with visual impairment (n = 64) from both communities participated in the study. Barriers and facilitators to accessing the services were explored through focus groups and prioritized during one-on-one interviews, which allowed for comparison between communities. Results Twelve themes were identified: (a) bureaucracy and funding (public policy); (b) public awareness and stigma (community); (c) services available, knowledge of providers, care coordination, transportation (organizational); (d) people and lack of awareness of family/friends (interpersonal); and (e) income, health status, knowledge, self-advocacy, and time (individual). Conclusion This study provides insights into the perceived barriers and facilitators of accessing low vision rehabilitation services for older adults with vision impairment living in Massachusetts, USA. Key findings indicate the need for improved awareness of these services at the provider and consumer level, coordinated care, increased education on the efficacy of occupational therapy low vision rehabilitation services, client-centered care provided when the client is ready to accept services, and service provision that addresses sociodemographic factors.

AB Context: Policymaking is a highly complex process that is often difficult to predict or influence. Most of the scholarship examining the role of research evidence in policymaking has focused narrowly on characteristics of the evidence and the interactions between scientists and government officials. The real-life context in which policymakers are situated and make decisions also is crucial to the development of evidence-informed policy.
   Methods: This qualitative study expands on other studies of research utilization at the state level through interviews with twenty-eight state legislators and administrators about their real-life experiences incorporating evidence into policymaking. The interviews were coded inductively into the following categories: (1) the important or controversial issue or problem being addressed, (2) the information that was used, (3) facilitators, and (4) hindrances.
   Findings: Hindrances to evidence-informed policymaking included institutional features; characteristics of the evidence supply, such as research quantity, quality, accessibility, and usability; and competing sources of influence, such as interest groups. The policymakers identified a number of facilitators to the use of evidence, including linking research to concrete impacts, costs, and benefits; reframing policy issues to fit the research; training to use evidence-based skills; and developing research venues and collaborative relationships in order to generate relevant evidence.
   Conclusions: Certain hindrances to the incorporation of research into policy, like limited budgets, are systemic and not readily altered. However, some of the barriers and facilitators of evidence-informed health policymaking are amenable to change. Policymakers could benefit from evidence-based skills training to help them identify and evaluate high-quality information. Researchers and policymakers thus could collaborate to develop networks for generating and sharing relevant evidence for policy.

DE discourse institutionalism; global governance; knowledge utilization
AB The G20 is an evolving international institution. Aided by both advances in information technology and support from home governments, a number of knowledge actors and networks seek to influence global economic governance with policy analysis and advice. This article assesses the international G20 think tank network called Think20 and the policy advocacy of private research institutes (such the Lowy Institute in Australia and the Centre for International Governance and Innovation in Canada) which are in the orbit of the G20 policy community. Think20 assists the global economic governance processes of the G20 by developing coordinative discourses' for policy development and implementation. Points for practitioners Ideas matter but ideas that imply major policy reform and innovation need to be made to matter if they are to direct government action. Networks provide one mechanism to broadcast and disseminate communicative discourses' to many different publics - local as well as global - and the infrastructure to crystalize and amplify coordinative discourses' underpinning the policy blueprints and reform proposals of governments that must motivate their own bureaucracies as well as collaborate with foreign government. This article discusses some of the network tools and practices for consensus building in transnational policy communities' that cultivate global policy coordination.

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HEALTH
AB Policies relating to contraceptive services (population, family planning and reproductive health policies) often receive weak or fluctuating levels of commitment from national policy elites in Southern countries, leading to slow policy evolution and undermining implementation. This is true of Kenya, despite the governments early progress in committing to population and reproductive health policies, and its success in implementing them during the 1980s. This key informant study on family planning policy in Kenya found that policy space contracted, and then began to expand, because of shifts in contextual factors, and because of the actions of different actors. Policy space contracted during the mid-1990s in the context of weakening prioritization of reproductive health in national and international policy agendas, undermining access to contraceptive services and contributing to the stalling of the countrys fertility rates. However, during the mid-2000s, champions of family planning within the Kenyan Government bureaucracy played an important role in expanding the policy space through both public and hidden advocacy activities. The case study demonstrates that policy space analysis can provide useful insights into the dynamics of routine policy and programme evolution and the challenge of sustaining support for issues even after they have reached the policy agenda.

DE Kyrgyzstan; palliative care; Central Asia; Soros Foundation-Kyrgyzstan
AB Palliative care began in Kyrgyzstan in 2005 as a pilot home-based care program in Osh Cancer Center and was supported by a small group of nurses and one physician from Scotland. In 2010, the Soros Foundation-Kyrgyzstan and the Open Society Foundation's International Palliative Care Initiative began supporting work on palliative care policy, legislation, essential medicine availability, education, advocacy, and implementation. A Ministry of Health working group was established to lead this initiative, and technical assistance was provided by an international palliative care consultant. Work began with a national needs assessment, which identified the existing barriers to the provision of quality palliative care, and recommendations were made to the working group to address these challenges. Today, palliative care is included in many national health care policies and laws, a national palliative care association has been established, undergraduate medical and nursing education include elements of palliative care, oral morphine and fentanyl patches are now available in parts of the country, inpatient services exist in the National Cancer Center in Osh and Bishkek, two tuberculosis hospitals with multidrug resistant/extensively drug resistant, and home care services in Osh and Bishkek. Public information campaigns and advocacy activities continue to increase public awareness about palliative care and press government action.

AB All politics and policy issues involve the accumulation of data about problems and solutions in context of social interactions. Drawing on these data, policy actors acquire, translate, and disseminate new information and knowledge toward achieving political endeavors and for revising or strengthening their policy-related beliefs over time. Policy learning' is a concept that refers to this cognitive and social dynamic. Articles in this special issue examine the relationship between policy learning and policy change from different theoretical perspectives. In this introduction to the special issue, we describe the current approaches that structure the field and gaps in knowledge separating policy learning and policy change. We introduce a refined conceptual framework to outline and compare the articles in the issue. These articles point to several facets of the learning phenomenon. First, the articles focus on the nature and consequences of learning by specific groups of society, such as advocacy coalitions, epistemic communities, citizens, street-level bureaucrats, and policy brokers. Second, they present learning processes in which information and experience are used to acquire new knowledge on policy objectives to substantiate and legitimize them or to change or form beliefs. Third, they identify several cognitive and social processes to strengthen the connection between policy learning and policy change. Finally, the articles point to several psychological, social, and institutional factors fostering or impeding these cognitive and social processes. This introduction concludes with avenues for future research.

TI Brown and green in Durban: The evolution of environmental policy in a
   post-apartheid city
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB This article concerns the politics of environmental policy as it has been evolving in the South African city of Durban. How has the end of apartheid impacted on environmental issues and concerns? Since 1994 (actually 1996 from the standpoint of local government), the transition to democracy has brought about a shift from purely green policy to the growing salience of what we may call brown issues. The article first considers the elements of what we would now denote as environmental policy under the old regime and then outlines the policy shifts in recent years. The second half of the article looks at what have emerged as the most significant policy issues with regard to the environment, the future of the South Coast Industrial Basin, the environmental concerns that arise from the construction of new housing settlements and (more briefly) debates about the future of the Bay of Natal and some of the issues at play in the development of an integrated social health policy. With South Africa's emergence from isolation, international mandates for environmental controls and planning have been formally adopted, this article argues that the actual application of policy from word to deed is another matter. Democratization has opened tip debates and created a far healthier climate for the discussion of urban issues. but formal institutional and procedural changes are far from sufficient to ensure new approaches on the ground. The presence or absence of effective environmental lobbying from community organizations and of environmental champions within the bureaucracy are critical factors. The planning process in Durban, inevitably subject to immediate political pressures, is still far from achieving the more holistic ambition of integrating environmental and developmental concerns.

AB Just like national administration, international organizations are subject to politicization and its ambivalent effects. The present article makes use of relevant contributions to the theory of formal organizations and bureaucracy in an attempt to conceptualize the politicization phenomenon. A case of norm emergence and norm implementation within the system of the United Nations is analyzed, the principle of a Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and the phases of its constructive and obstructive politicization. The argument is that the impact of politicization increases when internal and external politicization impulses coincide and that strategic communication of policy entrepreneurs may decisively influence the constructive or obstructive character of politicization.

   and the rebirth of the public interest imperative
SO PUBLIC CHOICE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Regulation; Political demand and supply
AB George Stigler's pathbreaking 1971 article set forth a clear and testable economic theory of regulation and fundamentally changed how economists and others organized their thoughts about government regulation. Until Stigler's work appeared, the public interest theory, the notion that elected officials and bureaucrats sought first to respond to the broad public desire for government services, dominated the literature. Stigler changed that and in doing so pushed the public interest theory aside. But there was something lacking in Stigler's regulation theory that suggests there is still a strong role to be played by the public interest theory. While Stigler argued that politicians respond primarily to private interest demand for their services, it is still the case that politicians must explain their actions to the broad public and must work to make certain that the private interest regulatory benefits they produce are actually delivered. Justification and assurance of delivery are functions that are served in the Bootlegger/Baptist theory of regulation. Because the Bootlegger/Baptist theory combines the demand of two interest groups for the same regulatory service, the result will be more regulation. And the fact that both Bootleggers and Baptists will assist in seeing that regulation benefits are delivered, their activity reduces the cost encountered by politicians when seeking to serve the two groups. Again, more regulation will result.

AB The present study analyzed the role of Turkey's think tanks as NGOs and conducted a case study on the Foundation for Political, Economic, and Social Research (SETA), an organization that appears to dominate Turkish think thanks' sphere of activity. Based on the general classifications accepted in the literature on think tanks, the study found that SETA is a "political party affiliation" and "advocacy" think tank. Since its establishment, SETA has been ideologically aligned with the Justice and Development Party (AK Party). It acts as a partner in the design of AK Party policies, provides human resources to the AK Party bureaucracy, and conducts public diplomacy to legitimize these policies in the public eye. According to the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program's (TTCSP) data for 2019, 48 think tanks exist in Turkey. The fact that SETA stands out so significantly from its peers suggests that pluralism has been lost in this field and that a monopolization policy is preferred. This study concluded that if a country's NGOs are weak, this will lead to a democratic deficit. Utilizing Carl Schmitt's theory of "the total state," the study analyzed the way in which the post-2016 state-of-emergency regime and the new political regime that emerged following Turkey's constitutional amendments in 2017 have narrowed the sphere of influence of think tanks and NGOs in Turkey.

AB The Turkish government first announced its intention to proceed with tobacco plain packaging legislation in 2011; however, it was 7 years before the legislation passed in December 2018. This study (conducted in 2018 before the legislation was passed) explored the policy context in Turkey between the first announcement that plain packaging legislation would be introduced and the passage of the legislation in 2018, and identified barriers and facilitators influencing its introduction. Publicly available documents relevant to plain packaging in Turkey were analysed. Interviews were conducted in 2018 with ten key informants including academics, bureaucrats in government ministries and leaders of non-government organizations (NGOs). Thematic analysis was undertaken, using a framework for systematically analysing how issues reach the policy agenda. The introduction of plain packaging legislation proved to be problematic, with many false starts and delays. Findings suggest these were mainly due to political barriers including changes in government, tobacco industry opposition and the national economic crisis. However, plain packaging legislation in Turkey managed to advance on the policy agenda, primarily through the collaborative advocacy efforts of NGOs, academics, and leadership from particular tobacco control advocates and politicians. Turkey's experience provides lessons for the wider uptake of tobacco plain packaging legislation, illustrating the critical importance of building effective coalitions between a range of stakeholders and political support within government while raising public awareness. Lay summary This research provides insights into the barriers and facilitators of decision making and action that shaped the process of introducing tobacco plain packaging legislation in Turkey. Major barriers that slowed Turkey's progress in enacting plain packaging included the financial and national economic crisis in 2018, changes in health ministers and opposition by the tobacco industry. A major facilitator of the policy process was the collaborative advocacy efforts of non-government organizations, academics, politicians and the leadership of certain tobacco control advocates. The insights from this case study may help other low- and middle-income countries to anticipate and successfully navigate the challenges involved in introducing tobacco plain packaging, an important policy measure for reducing the burden of tobacco-related disease in their populations, and its social and economic impacts. Building effective coalitions and fostering and supporting leadership are important strategies for the successful introduction of plain packaging legislation.

AB The Massachusetts' Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA) of 1989 set an important milestone in the roadmap to Clean Production. The Act's focus on a clear definition, methodology, and mandatory planning requirements have proved successful in getting companies in Massachusetts to reduce their use of toxic chemicals in manufacturing processes. Such results are inspirational for government officials and advocacy groups attempting to reduce toxic emissions in their communities and set progressive chemicals use policies. This paper will summarize three initiatives where TURA was a catalyst and continues to impact international chemicals policy: the Sewer Use By-law in Toronto, Canada; the European Union's REACH chemicals legislation and the international campaign by Greenpeace in Asia and Latin America to achieve zero discharge of hazardous substances into rivers. The example of Toronto and REACH show how one or more essential aspects of TURA were incorporated into legislation. In the case of REACH TURA's requirement of mandatory planning became an important example and NGO demand during the formation of Europe's new chemicals regulation and resulted in the first substitution assessment planning requirement in EU wide legislation. Work is now ongoing to promote TURA type legislation in Latin America and Asia. However the ability to transfer the TURA framework to regions with inadequate government oversight and cheap disposal costs is seriously hampered. Although NGO campaigns in Asian and Latin America advocate zero discharge of hazardous emissions through toxics use reduction and elimination, much training and accountability will be needed within government and companies to understand the benefits of toxics use reduction and actually implement all or parts of the TURA framework. The Toxics Use Reduction Act came into force in 1989 with high environmental awareness, an engaged citizenry and a responsive government entity. Perhaps these are the same conditions that must exist for its successful transference to industrializing countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Destabilization right: How public law litigation succeeds
SO HARVARD LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Review
ID STATE CONSTITUTIONS; REMEDIES; LIMITS; FORMS; JUDGE
AB "Public law litigation" - civil rights advocacy seeking to restructure public agencies has changed course over the last three decades. It has moved away from remedial intervention modeled on command-and-control bureaucracy toward a kind of intervention that can be called "experimentalist." Instead of top-down, fixed-rule regimes, the experimentalist approach emphasizes ongoing stakeholder negotiation, continuously revised performance measures, and transparency. Experimentalism is evident in all the principal areas of public law intervention - schools, mental health institutions, prisons, police, and public housing. This development has been substantially unanticipated and unnoticed by both advocates and critics of public law litigation. In this Article, we describe the emergence of the experimentalist model and argue that it moots many common criticisms of public law litigation. We further suggest that it implies answers to some prominent doctrinal issues, including the limits on judicial discretion in enforcing public law rights and the constraints entailed by separation-of-powers norms. Our interpretation understands public law cases as core instances of "destabilization rights" - rights to disentrench an institution that has systematically failed to meet its obligations and remained immune to traditional forces of political correction. It suggests reasons why judicial recognition and enforcement of such rights might be both effective in inducing better compliance with legal obligations and consistent with our structure of government.

TI Challenges to fair decision-making processes in the context of health
   care services: a qualitative assessment from Tanzania
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Fairness; Decision-making processes; Health care services; Health
   systems
ID PRIORITY; ACCOUNTABILITY; STRATEGY
AB Background: Fair processes in decision making need the involvement of stakeholders who can discuss issues and reach an agreement based on reasons that are justifiable and appropriate in meeting people's needs. In Tanzania, the policy of decentralization and the health sector reform place an emphasis on community participation in making decisions in health care. However, aspects that can influence an individual's opportunity to be listened to and to contribute to discussion have been researched to a very limited extent in low-income settings. The objective of this study was to explore challenges to fair decision-making processes in health care services with a special focus on the potential influence of gender, wealth, ethnicity and education. We draw on the principle of fairness as outlined in the deliberative democratic theory.
   Methods: The study was carried out in the Mbarali District of Tanzania. A qualitative study design was used. In-depth interviews and focus group discussion were conducted among members of the district health team, local government officials, health care providers and community members. Informal discussion on the topics was also of substantial value.
   Results: The study findings indicate a substantial influence of gender, wealth, ethnicity and education on health care decision-making processes. Men, wealthy individuals, members of strong ethnic groups and highly educated individuals had greater influence. Opinions varied among the study informants as to whether such differences should be considered fair. The differences in levels of influence emerged most clearly at the community level, and were largely perceived as legitimate.
   Conclusions: Existing challenges related to individuals' influence of decision making processes in health care need to be addressed if greater participation is desired. There is a need for increased advocacy and a strengthening of responsive practices with an emphasis on the right of all individuals to participate in decision-making processes. This simultaneously implies an emphasis on assuring the distribution of information, training and education so that individuals can participate fully in informed decision making.

AB Despite attempts to end homelessness in the United States occurring over the past 10 years, homelessness has only been reduced by about 10%. This article introduces a theoretical model for why some individuals have gained housing and other types of services while others have not. This model incorporates both the political economy theory and the street-level bureaucracy theory to explain service gaps for homeless individuals. Using this model, this article explains major policies affecting agencies which serve the homeless. It also uses current research to explain how practitioners manage these constraints. Recommendations for social service practitioners are discussed.

ID LABOR-MARKET POLICIES; WELFARE; CITIZENSHIP
AB Contemporary active labour market (ALM) reforms are pivotal in the reorganization of the welfare state as they challenge and threaten some of the fundamental achievements of labour in capitalist societies: social programmes and entitlements that compensate for unemployment, and governance arrangements in which the social partners share authority and responsibility with the state. Consequently, ALM reforms may give raise to social unrest and political struggle that involves the state (the main proponent of ALM reforms), trade unions and political parties. These conflicts are important in the politicization of reforms, i.e. raising public awareness of and engagement with controversies of welfare state change.
   In this article, we use a non-European perspective to ask more generally how distinct historical institutions create separate 'politicization trajectories' of ALM reforms, which in turn produce different policy designs and outcomes. Centring on the case of Israel, in which historically 'abnormal' class politics fostered indifference to the reform in both trade unions and political parties, we maintain that the preliminary de-politicization made it possible for bureaucrats to control the reform, leading to an intra-state conflict between competing agencies over its design and implementation. The usurpation of the reform by the Ministry of Finance made it conspicuously unbalanced, provoking many grievances. Paradoxically, the de-politicization of the reform advanced its re-politicization, led by non-governmental advocacy organizations in civil society. These uncommon political actors in the politics of ALM reforms were able to lead a counter-coalition, delegitimize the reform, and mobilize politicians to eventually terminate activation

AB Background: Structural factors are known to affect individual risk and vulnerability to HIV. In the context of an HIV prevention programme for over 60,000 female sex workers (FSWs) in south India, we developed structural interventions involving policy makers, secondary stakeholders (police, government officials, lawyers, media) and primary stakeholders (FSWs themselves). The purpose of the interventions was to address context-specific factors (social inequity, violence and harassment, and stigma and discrimination) contributing to HIV vulnerability. We advocated with government authorities for HIV/AIDS as an economic, social and developmental issue, and solicited political leadership to embed HIV/AIDS issues throughout governmental programmes. We mobilised FSWs and appraised them of their legal rights, and worked with FSWs and people with HIV/AIDS to implement sensitization and awareness training for more than 175 government officials, 13,500 police and 950 journalists.
   Methods: Standardised, routine programme monitoring indicators on service provision, service uptake, and community activities were collected monthly from 18 districts in Karnataka between 2007 and 2009. Daily tracking of news articles concerning HIV/AIDS and FSWs was undertaken manually in selected districts between 2005 and 2008.
   Results: The HIV prevention programme is now operating at scale, with over 60,000 FSWs regularly contacted by peer educators, and over 17,000 FSWs accessing project services for sexually transmitted infections monthly. FSW membership in community-based organisations has increased from 8,000 to 37,000, and over 46,000 FSWs have now been referred for government-sponsored social entitlements. FSWs were supported to redress > 90% of the 4,600 reported incidents of violence and harassment reported between 2007-2009, and monitoring of news stories has shown a 50% increase in the number of positive media reports on HIV/AIDS and FSWs.
   Conclusions: Stigma, discrimination, violence, harassment and social equity issues are critical concerns of FSWs. This report demonstrates that it is possible to address these broader structural factors as part of large-scale HIV prevention programming. Although assessing the impact of the various components of a structural intervention on reducing HIV vulnerability is difficult, addressing the broader structural factors contributing to FSW vulnerability is critical to enable these vulnerable women to become sufficiently empowered to adopt the safer sexual behaviours which are required to respond effectively to the HIV epidemic.

AB It is widely recognised that the Japanese healthcare system has been ranked as one of the best in the world because of its excellent efficiency and equity. The longevity and low infant mortality of the Japanese population have been achieved with a relatively low ratio of health expenditure to gross domestic product. All Japanese are covered by universal medical care insurance and all are provided with completely free access to the same medical care.
   Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the medical care service is not as good as it looks. Owing to lack of competition between both hospitals and powerless insurers - the outcome of too many regulations - there is only a small incentive to improve the efficiency and quality of medical service. Furthermore, because of Japan's rapidly aging society and low birth rate, together with the long depression the economy has experienced, it is very difficult to maintain the 'pay-as-you-go' health system.
   For health system reform, our proposals are as follows: deregulating health markets, including pharmaceutical markets; strengthening the role of insurers; introducing information technology; and restructuring the healthcare of the elderly. We are expecting the new cabinet, which enjoys much popularity, to have the courage to initiate health reform along these lines, in spite of opposition from powerful interest groups, bureaucrats, and even members of ruling parties.

ID POLICY
AB Research Questions: This paper aims to identify the nature of continuity and change in the management of the elite sports system in China from 2001, when Beijing was awarded the 2008 Olympic Games, to 2013.
   Research Method: The paper draws on the application of theories of the discursive construction of management strategy. Strategic policy documents are reviewed and data from a series of semi-structured interviews with key representatives of stakeholder groups are analysed.
   Result & Findings: The paper scrutinises the power of sports bureaucrats, whose careers have been premised upon the success of the Juguo Tizhi system, over the Chinese elite sport management discourse, which, for example, justify the retention of the traditional system by invoking fear of Olympic failure, and/or cloaking advocacy of retention of elements of the Juguo Tizhi system in the rhetoric of reform. The research underlines the construction of competing elite sport management approaches at a juncture in the development of the management of the Chinese sporting system. This reflects a clash of ideologies in the roles of the state and the market, with direct consequences for management of elite sporting organisations.
   Implications: The research highlights the nature of, and the exercise of power in, the construction of management 'realities' of Chinese elite sport; unveils the embedded tension between state-control of elite performance and the reform of the management of Chinese elite sport. It provides a way of understanding the power relationship among different elite sport management ideologies simultaneously addressed by the Chinese government.

AB This study investigates the policy process through which net neutrality (NN) policy in Israel has been shaped. The analysis employs a framework based on the Internet Governance concept and the multi-stakeholder approach. Based on the analysis of formal documents, debates in parliamentary committees and the Parliament plenum, and position papers of various actors, the findings show that NN policy in Israel is one more layer of the neo-liberal policy in the telecommunication sector. It is demonstrated how experts and bureaucrats, influenced by industry interests, have been dominant during the policy process while civil society groups representing the public interests have been only marginal actors. The paper concludes with a call for a more proactive attitude of all stakeholder groups in order to enable a more balanced governance of central internet issues, such as NN.

AB The dominant theory of elite power, grounded in Weberian bureaucracy, has analyzed elites in terms of stable positions at the top of enduring institutions. Today, many conditions that spawned these stable command posts' no longer prevail, and elite power thus warrants rethinking. This article advances an argument about contemporary influence elites'. The way they are organized and the modus operandi they employ to wield influence enable them to evade public accountability, a hallmark of a democratic society. Three cases are presented, first to investigate changes in how elites operate and, second, to examine varying configurations in which the new elites are organized. The cases demonstrate that influence elites intermesh hierarchies and networks, serve as connectors, and coordinate influence from multiple, moving perches, inside and outside official structures. Their flexible and multi-positioned organizing modes call for reconsidering elite theory and grappling with the implications of these elites for democratic society.

AB Over the last two decades many alternate theories of the policy process have been developed. This essay covers recent scholarship (from 2008 to 2010) regarding the major policy process theories. In addition, several recent trends in research are discussed including; the use of narrative in policy theory, issues that cross multiple subsystems, bureaucracy in the policy process, and synthesizing multiple theories and frameworks.

AB In Soviet times, water management was presented generally as a technical issue to be taken care of by the state water bureaucracy. Due to structural changes in agriculture in the two decades post-independence, irrigation water management has become an explicitly political and social issue in Central Asia. With the state still heavily present in the regulation of agricultural production, the situation in Uzbekistan differs from other post-communist states. Water management strategies are still strongly 'Soviet' in approach, regarded by state actors as purely 'technical', because other dimensions - economic, social and political - are 'fixed' through strong state regulation. However, new mechanisms are appearing in this authoritarian and technocratic framework. The application of a framework for socio-technical analysis in some selected Water Users' Associations (WUAs) in northwest Uzbekistan's Khorezm region shows that the WUAs are becoming arenas of interaction for different interest groups involved in water management. The socio-technical analysis of Khorezm's water management highlights growing social differences at grass root level in the study of WUAs. The process of social differentiation is in its early phases, but is still able to express itself fully due to the strict state control of agriculture and social life in general.

AB Several global narratives around resource insecurities have reached the Mekong Region. In the latest re-incarnation, experts, bureaucrats and businesses have called for greater attention to a water-energy-food nexus. It is not clear however, if they are talking about the same thing, with the same purpose or that decision-makers are listening. The purpose of this study was to identify the key features of nexus narratives globally, and then analyze how they are being used in the Mekong Region. We used the Narrative Policy Framework to explore narrative content and strategies, and Cultural Theory to help identify policy beliefs of competing coalitions in a mixed-methods analysis. Increasing resource scarcity, which undermines security, was a shared setting in all nexus narratives. Individualist and Hierarchist narratives tend to de-politicize the nexus by promising solutions from innovative businesses and free markets, or through technocratic and managerial control of resources and the environment by bureaucrats. Egalitarian narratives identify victims and villains to re-politicize the nexus around themes of justice and human security. Nexus narratives were used to support and oppose hydropower, irrigation and biofuel development, with Individualist narratives consistently being the most pro-development. Nexus narratives have been widely adopted by international organizations and foreign experts working in the Mekong Region; however, with a few exceptions, they have as of yet had little direct influence on national policy or plans. Several possible reasons are discussed, including limitations of the concept itself.

   INDIVIDUALS; SCHOLAR
AB Importance: Adults aging with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) continue to face barriers to participation in meaningful occupation; moreover, the increased life expectancy of adults with IDD intensifies the need for age- and environment-specific support.
   Objective: To map and categorize transdisciplinary literature on environmental modifications and supports for adults aging with IDD.
   Data Sources: Studies published between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2019, identified through PubMed and Scopus.
   Study Selection and Data Collection: Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria and contained information specific to occupational participation based on environmental modification (e.g., physical space, technology, universal design, type of living setting), social supports (e.g., family members, caretakers, peer groups, health care professionals, policies, organizational infrastructure), or both and adults age >= 35 yr with IDD.
   Findings: Eleven studies met the criteria for this scoping review. Thematic coding was used to examine the articles within one or more themes: definition of need, environmental risk and assessment, environmental setting, intervention and program planning, use of technology, and bureaucracy.
   Conclusions and Relevance: This review highlights collective and individual outcomes in the areas of assessment, intervention, and advocacy. Further research is needed within the scope of occupational therapy and disability studies that examines environmental factors and participation outcomes in this population.
   What This Article Adds: The authors define the interconnectedness of adults aging with IDD and environmental factors, identify barriers to participation, and guide occupational therapy practitioners' logic on how to positively affect environmental change and supports through intervention.

AB Available studies on the accountability relation between social work and the government are mainly conducted in Anglo-Saxion countries. This limits the generalizability of these findings to other countries. Moreover, these studies hardly descent to the street-level, making the perceptions and actions of social workers barely visible. To address this gap, this article explores how three elements of governance interact with street-level accountability of social workers in homeless care in three country cases (the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany). The data (N26) was gathered by means of a mixed method design (interviews, focus groups and document analysis). By combining a street-level bureaucracy research approach with a relational definition of accountability, we opened up the black box of what happens in these organizations and bridged the gap between macro-level mechanisms and street-level accountability. Our study adds three important insights to street-level research of accountability in social work. First, elements of governance cannot be studied in isolation. Mechanisms should always be explained in relation to the context in which they are embedded. Second, the social workers in our cases do not perceive their accountability to the government as a professional obligation. They see it as a strategic mechanism to secure funding. Third, interaction is an important condition for the engagement of the social workers in their accountability relation with the government. More research is needed to develop a multi-level theory that identifies which mechanisms play a role in the accountability relation between the government and social workers.

AB Since 1991, India, like many countries, has undergone a process of 'liberalisation' which has entailed an increase in outsourcing of public services through Public Private Partnerships. In December 2012, Chhattisgarh state started the process of outsourcing diagnostics and radiology services in 379 government health facilities. Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (People's Health Movement) Chhattisgarh mounted a (so far) successful campaign against this move. Drawing on secondary data and the personal experiences and observations of the author, this paper documents Jan Swasthya Abhiyan's struggle, describing the strategies that were used, their efficacy, the facilitators and challenges. It uses this experience as a basis to reflectively suggest lessons for health activism and the theoretical implications. Jan Swasthya Abhiyan founded its resistance on a detailed evidence-based critique of the proposal that was disseminated, along with demands. The campaign then used multiple strategies, from petitioning the government, to street action, to advocacy with media and bureaucrats. Alliances were built with trade unions and groups working on social justice issues. Privatisation and neo-liberal policies provided a rallying point and framing the issue as a moral argument and in terms of larger concerns for social justice helped build wider solidarity. This experience suggests that the use of evidence and multiple strategies, effective framing of the issue, forging broader alliances, and a sustained campaign can all be important strategies for health activism. It also highlights the need for health activism to continue beyond a single campaign. Staying vigilant, monitoring, evidence building, mobilizing people and continuing to build alliances on such issues are critical tasks for social movements and networks like the People's Health Movement.

ID AFFORDABLE CARE ACT; PROFIT STATUS
AB Public policy has created an "aging enterprise," which assures that the needs of older adults will be processed and treated as a commodity (e. g., medical services) and sold for a profit.
   The aging enterprise is composed of " the programs, organizations, bureaucracies, interest groups, trade associations, providers, and professionals that serve elders in one capacity or another. Major components include physicians, hospitals, the Social Security Administration, the Administration on Aging, state and area agencies on aging, congressional committees on aging, and the nursing home and insurance industries" (Estes, 1979).
   The primary beneficiary of this enterprise is the medical industrial complex, which comprises the most well-funded part of the aging enterprise. The medical industrial complex operates largely in the private (increasingly proprietary) sector, and is heavily subsidized by the federal government through Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable Care Act (ACA) policy and financing (Estes, 1979, 1986, and 1992; Estes and Associates, 2001).
   Old age, aging, and the policies designed to "treat" this stage of life are shaped by four social processes of consequence to our society: the bio-medicalization of aging; the commodification of aging; the privatization of old-age policy; and, the rationalization of old-age policy (Estes, 1991). These policies and services for older people are embedded in and reflective of larger trends in American life and society. Market ideologies and an ongoing shift to individual responsibility have accelerated and increased public costs through privatization and health and human services profits (Estes, 1991).
   The mini-history of this state of affairs begins with the 1965 passage of Medicare and Medicaid, and the well-documented government subsidies for the largely private (and lucrative) "American health empire" (Ehrenreich and Ehrenreich, 1970). Today, medical care accounts for 18 percent of the U. S. economy. Federal subsidies include, but are not limited to, substantial tax deductions for employer health insurance, hospital and nursing home construction, health workforce (mainly Medicare physicians) training, research (e. g., National Institutes of Health), and tax exemptions for nonprofits. The latest data for 2007 show that the largest tax subsidy for private health insurance-the federal exclusion from income and payroll taxes of employer and employee contributions for employer-sponsored health insurance-is estimated at $200 billion in lost revenues (Kaiser Family Foundation [KFF], 2008).
   The Joint Committee on Taxation (2008) reports an even higher amount: $143 billion lost in federal income tax and $100 billion for FICA taxes as tax expenditures for the employer coverage tax exclusion.
   In 2003, legislation continued and expanded government funding for proprietary healthcare (e. g., the pharmaceutical industry's Medicare Part D bill) that prohibits Medicare from negotiating drug prices and excludes Medicare from participating in or competing with private drug management companies, and forbids drug discounts to those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles), while giving bonus subsidies to private Medicare Advantage plans. The 2010 ACA both reduced and added different and new government subsidies for mostly private (and largely for-profit) Medicare services. Although the ACA cut or reduced some government subsidies (e. g., managed care and provider payments), industry lobbying has scaled back or delayed many such cost-saving provisions.

AB Background Pneumonia and possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) are leading causes of death among under-five children. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued global recommendations for the case management of childhood pneumonia and PSBI when referral is not feasible with oral amoxicillin. However, few governments to date have incorporated child-friendly amoxicillin dispersible tablets (DT) into their national treatment guidelines and policies. We aimed to understand the key drivers to the implementation of WHO recommendations for childhood pneumonia and PSBI using amoxicillin DT in Bangladesh. Methods A qualitative study was conducted from October 2017 to March 2018 in two districts of Bangladesh. Interviews were completed with 67 participants consisting of government officials and key stakeholders, international development agencies, health service providers (HSPs), and caregivers of young children diagnosed and treated with amoxicillin for pneumonia or PSBI. Data were analyzed thematically. Results Policies and operational planning emerged as paramount to ensuring access to essential medicines for childhood pneumonia and PSBI. Though amoxicillin DT is included for National Newborn Health Programme and Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses in the Operational Plan of the Directorate General of Health Services, inclusion in Community-Based Healthcare Project and Directorate General of Family Planning policies is imperative to securing national supply, access, and uptake. At the sub-national level, training on the use of amoxicillin DT as a first line intervention is lacking, resulting in inadequate management of childhood pneumonia by HSPs. Advocacy activities are needed to create community-wide demand among key stakeholders, HSPs, and caregivers not yet convinced that amoxicillin DT is the preferred formulation for the management of childhood pneumonia and PSBI. Conclusion Challenges in policy and supply at the national level and HSP preparedness at the sub-national levels contribute to the slow adoption of WHO recommendations for amoxicillin DT in Bangladesh. A consultation meeting to disseminate study findings was instrumental in driving the development of recommendations by key stakeholders to address these challenges. A comprehensive and inclusive evidence-based strategy involving all divisions of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare will be required to achieve national adoption of WHO recommendations and country-wide introduction of amoxicillin DT in Bangladesh.

ID STATE; RETURN
AB When studying the formation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, scholars have usually focused on interest groups and electoral politics. This essay, by contrast, suggests that the reputation and network influences of an existing federal agency, the Bureau of Corporations, also shaped the creation of its successor, the FTC. Building on the concept of bureaucratic autonomy, the essay examines the structure of the bureau, its connections, and its preferences. The bureau's leaders favored a clear separation from the Department of Justice and argued for a quasi-judicial process for antitrust, which they felt would be more effective than the courts. They advocated discretion in covering small firms and mandatory annual reports, while seeking to avoid being assigned authority to clear business agreements in advance. Well before the 1914 debates, leaders at the bureau directed substantial funds toward influencing trust legislation. They contacted academics and civic leaders, tracked existing legislative proposals, and analyzed key legal terms. Internal studies examined major questions, such as how to define and regulate unfair trade practices. Bureau officials came to argue Congress could never define these in legislation. Instead a bureaucracy with appropriate authority could adapt definitions of unfair practices to changes in business. When the bureau became the nucleus of the FTC, it received much of the discretionary power it sought.

AB Private-sector planners in Turkey have been operating in a planning system that has been restructured within the framework of neoliberal urban policies for the last forty years. Especially after 2000, while the model of growth over construction was adopted as a basic economic policy, the planning practices that implemented these policies were seen as a means of capital accumulation by wider social groups. In this economic political environment, private-sector planners have entered into new relationships with politics, markets, and bureaucracy, and have settled in the centre of criticism with professional practices that fall behind the basic principles of the profession, such as land speculation and serving certain pressure groups instead of the public interest. This article focuses on the conditions in which private-sector planners realize their planning practices and the problems they encounter in their plan-making processes. According to private-sector planners, the most important problem is the increase in the determination of rent-oriented interest relations between public institutions and local market actors instead of public benefit in the planning process. Private-sector planners believe that at every stage of the planning process, politicians and market actors exert pressure on planners, and that these forces have caused Turkey's planning practices to decline.

AB after the tumultuous Soekarno government in the late 1960's, the army chief General Suharto emerged as a new leader with the primary task to repair Indonesia's economic growth and restore the international community's confidence in Indonesia's economy. To carry out this tremendous challenge, Suharto appointed a group of talented economist from the University of Indonesia who mostly were graduated from the United States best known as the Technocrats. The Technocrats were able to assist Suharto in restoring and even delivering an unprecedented economic growth of more than 5% with full support from the international community during the late 1960s to the early 1990s. However, in the next stage, the Technocrats had to face even more challenges as they confronted vested interest groups when they tried to push for substantial economic governance reform, like the so called 'financial generals', conglomerates and nationalist bureaucrats.
   This article will provide an analysis on the political aspects of the Technocrats embarking on this economic governance reform and identifying the extent of the progress of this reform. This article reveals how the Technocrats were eventually overwhelmed by their political adversary, thus was only able to deliver limited economic governance reform. This article utilizes primary sources including diplomatic correspondence, memos, reports from the United Kingdom (UK) Foreign Commonwealth Office and the Australia Department of Foreign Affairs as well as Indonesian and international mass media articles. To complement the documents, interviews with more than 30 relevant resource persons who mainly served or were indirectly involved in Suharto's government.

AB A remarkable research program exists conceptualizing policy change as dependent variable, and inquiring on factors causing it. A question so far neglected by political science is: to which extent does policy change as independent variable also lead to power changes among key policy actors so they can facilitate and flank those changes? Before this background this study aims to analyze the consequences of 25 years of policy changes on the power of the main bureaucratic actors in a particular policy field. Conceptually we draw on bureaucratic politics, power and relative gains theories and the concept of substantial vs. symbolic policy change. Empirically we focus on all substantive as well as symbolic policy changes within the forest policy sector in Bangladesh between 1989 and 2014. Our finding suggest that over 25 years both, substantive as well as symbolic policy changes bring about power gains for (i) subject-specific sectoral administrations, including multi-sectoral district authorities, who gain power to the largest extent, (ii) cross-cutting general bureaucracies on finance and planning, and (iii) foreign donor administrations. We conclude that esp. sectoral bureaucracies are very sensitive and knowledgeable about the power implications of policy changes specific to their fields of expertise and, hence, are able to follow a more efficient power strategy than their cross-cutting counterparts.

DE OHCHR; Human Rights Council; High Commissioner; Zeid; Bachelet
AB Before leaving his post in 2018, the outgoing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, made a series of critical remarks, both publicly and internally, regarding what he considered weakening of the integrity and effectiveness of the UN in its human rights mandate. Zeid's comments highlighted retrogressive tendencies making the task of a strong and independent High Commissioner exceedingly difficult. The post of High Commissioner, established in 1994 following decades of advocacy, to give a high level voice to human rights promotion and protection as well as to manage a secretariat for most UN human rights functions, has enjoyed mostly robust and effective leadership by its post-holders. Any High Commissioner faces challenge inherent to the job in balancing the functions of diplomat, human rights advocate for "the voiceless", and agency manager working with an insufficient and patently unfair budgetary allotment. The new High Commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, will have her work cut out, as she faces an apparent retreat from prioritizing human rights, particularly by some States that previously championed them; ambivalence by a wider UN bureaucracy; and a wave of authoritarian populist leaders and movements around the globes that take a hostile view to the human rights paradigm. The new High Commissioner would do well to keep her energies squarely focused on independently tackling urgent substantive and possibly existential human rights challenges, rather than any project of administrative restructuring of the OHCHR, even as she may pursue a working methodology that is distinct from the approach of her predecessors.

AB In this commentary, the author uses New Literacy Studies theories to examine the Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI). Through analysis and critique of the CCSSI and related reform efforts underway in the United States, the author discusses how policy mandates can and have resulted in paradoxes. Corporate discourses of effectiveness and bureaucracy (intentionally or otherwise) undercut the use of research-based knowledge for literacy education reform. Consequently, professional literacy educators are positioned to subordinate themselves in the governance of their own profession despite statements by reform leaders that they must have the autonomy to make expert decisions that help students learn and practice literacy in contemporary society. The author calls for organizations like the International Reading Association to act politically and strategically, create knowledge, mobilize members, and educate stakeholders so that policy reforms become more equitable, just, and successful for the ends they are intended to meet.

AB Background: The prevalence of functional low vision in southeast Nigeria is reportedly the highest in the country. Aim: This study evaluated the state of low vision services and perceptions of providers and users of the service in tertiary hospitals in the region, to facilitate advocacy and planning. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey of available low vision services in the nine tertiary hospitals in Southeast Nigeria utilizing mixed methods. Data were collected on human resources, service delivery, and low vision equipment and devices. In-depth interviews were conducted to determine the perceptions of providers and users of the service. Results: Varying levels of low vision services were actively provided in three of the nine hospitals surveyed. Services, equipment, and devices were suboptimally available. The three functional centers had a combined output of 61 patients seen within 6 months preceding the study and had at most two-thirds of required equipment. Low vision devices (LVDs) were available in varying degrees in only four (44%) of the hospitals. Twenty-one (7.6%) of the 278 eye care personnel had some low vision training across seven hospitals. The challenges highlighted by providers were mainly inadequate funding (infrastructure, training, and equipment), communication gaps, and bureaucracy. Poor awareness, affordability, acceptability, and accessibility of LVDs were major constraints for users. Conclusion: Low vision services are available in some tertiary facilities in southeast Nigeria. Improved funding and better awareness of the availability of low vision services by eye care providers and the general public are needed to strengthen services.

   (DHN); Iran; Case study
ID CARE; POLITICS; HISTORY; EQUITY
AB Background: District Health Network (DHN), one of Iran's most successful health reforms, was launched in 1985 to provide primary health care (PHC), in response to health inequities in Iran. The present study aims to use interrelated elements of the 3i framework: ideas (e.g., beliefs and values, culture, knowledge, research evidence and solutions), interests (e.g., civil servants, pressure groups, elected parties, academians and researchers, and policy entrepreneurs), and institutions (e.g., rules, precedents, and organizational, government structures, policy network, and policy legacies) to explain retrospectively how (DHN) policy in Iran, as a developing country, was initiated and formed.
   Methods: A historical narrative approach with a case study perspective was employed to focus on the formation and framing process of DHN. For this purpose, the 3i framework was used as a guideline for data analysis. This study mainly searched and extracted secondary sources, including online news, reports, books, dissertations, and published articles in the scientific databases. Primary interviews as a supplementary source were also carried out to meet cross-validation of the data. Data were analyzed using a deductive and inductive approach.
   Results: According to the 3i framework, the following factors contributed to the formation of DHN policy in Iran: previous national efforts (for instance Rezaieh plan) and international events aiming to provide public health services for peripheral regions; dominant social discourses and values at the beginning of the Iranian revolution such as addressing the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups, which were embedded in the goals of DHN policy aiming to provide basic health services for deprived people especially living in rural and remote areas. Besides, the remarkable social cohesion and solidarity among people reinforced by the Iran-Iraq war were among other factors which contributed to the formation of participatory plans such as DHN (ideas). Main policy entrepreneurs including Minister of Health, his public health deputy and two planners of DHN with similar and rich background in the public health field and sharing the same beliefs (interests) which subsequently led to creation of tight-knit policy community network between them (institutions) also accelerated the creation of DHN in Iran to great extent. Political support of parliamentary representatives (interests), and formal laws such as principles of Iran Constitution (institutions) were also influential in passing the DHN in Iran.
   Conclusions: The 3i framework constituents would be insightful in explaining the creation of public health policies. This framework showed that the alignment of laws, structures, and interests of the main actors of the policy with the dominant ideas and beliefs in the society, opened the opportunity to form DHN in Iran.

AB Objective: Palliative, end-of-life care (PEOLC) providers are poorly resourced in addressing the needs of patients with mental health challenges, and the dying experiences of this cohort-particularly those with a comorbid, chronic and persistent mental illness (CPMI)-are poorly documented. We sought to explore the experiences of PEOLC providers with regard to caring for patients with mental health challenges, and gather insights into ways of improving accessibility and quality of PEOLC for these patients. Method: Twenty providers of PEOLC, from different disciplines, took part in semi structured interviews. The data were coded and analyzed using a reflexive, inductive-deductive process of thematic analysis. Results: The most prominent issues pertained to assessment of patients and differential diagnosis of CPMI, and preparedness of caregivers to deliver mental health interventions, given the isolation of palliative care from other agencies. Among the assets mentioned, informal relationships with frontline caregivers were seen as the main support structure, rather than the formal policies and procedures of the practice settings. Strategies to improve mental health care in PEOLC centered on holistic roles and interventions benefiting the entire palliative population, illustrating the participants saw little point in compartmentalizing mental illness, whether diagnosed or not. Significance of Results: Continuity of care and personal advocacy can significantly improve quality of life for end-of-life patients with mental health challenges, but bureaucracy and disciplinary siloing tend to isolate these patients and their caregivers. Improved interdisciplinary connectivity and innovative, hybridized roles encompassing palliation and psychiatry are 2 strategies to address this disconnect, as well as enhanced training in core mental health care competencies for PEOLC providers.

AB Barriers to entry in regulated markets are frequently conceptualized as static features that must be removed or overcome if new entrants are to successfully enter a market. But government institutions regulating markets often comprise multiple levels that exist in tension with one another due to differing incentives and motivations. We argue that the principal-agent tension between elected officials and agency bureaucrats may render regulatory barriers to entry more malleable, even in the absence of formal policy changes. To test this proposition, we bring the administrative state center stage and examine how regulatory discretion-regulatory agencies' flexibility to interpret and implement public policies created by elected officials-can influence the market entry of new ventures. Using data on regulatory approval of hydroelectric facilities in the United States from 1978 to 2014, we find that increased state agency discretion improves outcomes for new ventures relative to incumbent firms by freeing regulatory agency officials to interpret and implement policies according to a professional motivation of public service and reducing incumbents' political influence.

TI "THE LONG VIEW OF THE WATER/ENERGY NEXUS: HYDROPOWER'S FIRST CENTURY IN
   THE USA"
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ENERGY; POWER; LAW
AB This paper offers a historical overview of the first century of hydropower in the US from today's perspective of the water/energy nexus. Hydropower emerged as a technology in the 1880s and its development expanded until large dam building ended in the US in the 1970s-1980s. I summarize the century from the two different angles of the water sector and the electric power sector, as the roles and strategic importance of hydropower changed dramatically in the two sectors, in the parallel histories of water development and electric power development. The paper emphasizes the electricity side of the hydropower story because the water and environmental aspects are more widely known. During the first 50 years, hydropower dams were far more important to the electric power sector than they were to the water sector. Dams were juicy economic prizes that were fought over by private and public power utilities, politicians and government officials, and other interest groups, and that were built into the core of regional power grids during their foundational decades. Control of hydropower symbolized the deeper political and economic conflicts between public and private interests in the power sector, with hydropower becoming strongly identified with public power. In both sectors, there was a major turning point in the 1930s because of the growth and intervention of the Federal government in the New Deal. The earlier trends reversed and over the next 50 years hydropower became essential in the water sector - scaling up rapidly as the critical factor in paying for Federal multi-purpose water projects - and secondary in the power sector (with regional exceptions). In the power sector, hydropower's trajectory after the 1930s was paradoxical. It boomed in absolute terms, quadrupling in generating capacity as Federal agencies built hundreds of large dams, but hydropower's relative importance in the power sector declined steadily as the rest of the sector grew even faster. The half-century of hydropower's greatest expansion ended by its taking a smaller role in the overall power grid. Over the long run, the dynamics of the energy sector have dominated the water sector, a lesson that may apply to other examples of the water/energy nexus in the US and abroad.

AB Background: In 2006, a local collective combating homelessness set up an `experimental squat' in an abandoned building in Marseille, France's second largest city. They envisioned the squat as an alternative to conventional health and social services for individuals experiencing long-term homelessness and severe psychiatric disorders. Building on what they learned from the squat, some then joined a larger coalition that succeeded in convincing national government decision-makers to develop a scientific, intervention-based programme based on the Housing First model. This article analyses the political process through which social movement activism gave way to support for a state-funded programme for homeless people with mental disorders.
   Methods: A qualitative study of this political process was conducted between 2006 and 2014, using a hybrid theoretical perspective that combines attention to both top-down and bottom-up actions with a modified Advocacy Coalition Framework. In addition to document analysis of published and grey literature linked to the policy process, researchers drew on participant observation and observant participation of the political process. Data analysis consisted primarily of a thematic analysis of field-notes and semi-structured interviews with 65 relevant actors.
   Results: A coalition of local activists, state officials and national service providers transformed knowledge about a local innovation (an experimental therapeutic squat) into the rationale for a national, scientifically based project consisting of a randomised controlled trial of four state-supported Housing First sites, costing several million euros. The coalition's strategy was two-pronged, namely to defend a social cause (the right to housing) and to promote a scientifically validated means of realising positive outcomes (housing tenure) and cost-effectiveness (reduced hospitalisation costs).
   Conclusion: Activists' self-agency, especially that of making themselves audible to public authorities, was enhanced by the coalition's ability to seize `windows of opportunities' to their advantage. However, in contrast to the United States and Canadian Housing First contexts, which are driven by implementation science and related approaches, it was grassroots activists who promoted a scientific-technical approach among government officials unfamiliar with evidence-based practices in France. The windows of opportunity nevertheless failed to attract participation of those most in need of housing, raising the question of whether and how marginalised and/or subordinate groups can be integrated into collaborative research when a social movement-driven innovation turns into a scientific approach.

   Governance of Public Goods
SO EUROPEAN LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE EU constitution; EU institutions; EU law; EU nationals; Jurisprudence
AB This contribution suggests a republican interpretation of EU citizenship rights based on the following three propositions: first, the more globalisation transforms national into transnational public goods, the more democratic and republican constitutionalism requires to design and implement transnational public goods treaties as democratic law empowering citizens to invoke and enforce precise and unconditional multilevel market regulations and the protection of public goods vis-a-vis multilevel governance institutions. Secondly, as EU law, such as arts 2 and 9-12 TEU, requires EU Institutions and Member States to protect constitutional, representative, participatory and deliberative democracy and limits all internal and external EU powers by fundamental rights and protection of public goods (res publica), EU citizens rightly challenge EU trade, investment and other treaties that privilege interest groups and undermine the constitutional contract of citizens as codified in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Thirdly, just as common market and competition law inside and beyond the EU protect citizen-driven network governance and rights-based vigilance of EU citizens embedded into comprehensive protection of fundamental rights and a "social market economy" (art. 3 TEU), EU institutions should respond to the legitimacy and rule-of-law crises in other areas of EU governance by reconnecting EU law with EU citizens as democratic principals of multilevel governance agents. Anti-citizen clauses in EU free trade agreements with non-European countries (such as art. 30.6 CETA) and discriminatory arbitration privileges for foreign investors illustrate the authoritarian disconnect of EU bureaucrats from EU citizens; they risk undermining rule of law, constitutional democracy, and the "social market economy" inside the EU.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing education inequities, further marginalising those with poor and limited education opportunities, particularly in conflict, fragile, and insecure contexts. In the Global South, the COVID-19 pandemic compounds existing crises, frailties, and inequities as the impoverished suffer food insecurity, physical conflict, and crises of health and water. Existing research suggests that the pandemic has further disadvantaged marginalised communities, weakened learner performance, increased learning losses, and stretched already strained education budgets. However, little is known about the role of teachers in the policymaking process relating to matters that have a direct impact on their work. It is this gap that we address in this paper. Drawing on research, commissioned by the Open Society Foundation and Education International, based on a detailed desk-based review and interviews with purposefully selected Teachers' Union and Government officials in eight African countries, we examine the role of teachers in education policy-making processes and the kinds of support made available to them, or the lack thereof, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the conceptual framing of de Sousa Santos's sociology of absences and cognitive injustice, we demonstrate that teachers have been absent from policymaking processes and have not been adequately provided with the necessary professional development (PD) and psychosocial support to navigate the uncertainties and pedagogical requirements imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI ESTIMATING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF MASS DIGITIZATION PROJECTS ON
   COPYRIGHT HOLDERS: EVIDENCE FROM THE GOOGLE BOOK SEARCH LITIGATION
SO JOURNAL OF THE COPYRIGHT SOCIETY OF THE USA
LA English
DT Article
ID INDUSTRY
AB Google Book Search (GBS) has captured the attention of many commentators and government officials, but even as they vigorously debate its legality, few of them have marshaled new facts to estimate its likely effects on publishing and other information markets. This Article challenges the conventional wisdom propounded by the U.S. and German governments, as well as Microsoft and other competitors of Google, concerning the likely economic impact of mass book-digitization projects. Originally advanced by publishing industry lobbying groups, the prevailing account of mass book-digitization projects is that they will devastate authors and publishers, just as Napster and its heirs have supposedly devastated musicians and music labels. Using the impact of GBS on the revenues and operating incomes of U.S. publishers believing themselves to be the most-affected by it, this Article finds no evidence of a negative impact upon them. To the contrary, it provides some evidence of a positive impact, and proposes further empirical research to identify the mechanisms of digitization's economic impact.
   The debate surrounding the GBS settlement is important to students, writers, researchers, and the general public, as it may decide whether a federal appellate court or even the U.S. Supreme Court allows the best research tool ever designed to survive. If the theory of Microsoft and some publishing trade associations is accepted, the courts may enjoin and destroy GBS, just as Napster was shut down a decade ago.
   The article aims at a preliminary estimate of the economic impact of mass digitization projects, using GBS as a case in point. It finds little support for the much-discussed hypothesis of the Association of American Publishers and Google's competitors that the mass digitization of major U.S. libraries will reduce the revenues and profits of the most-affected publishers. In fact, the revenues and profits of the publishers who believe themselves to be most aggrieved by GBS, as measured by their willingness to file suit against Google for copyright infringement, increased at a faster rate after the project began, as compared to before its commencement. The rate of growth by publishers most affected by GBS is greater than the growth of the overall U.S. economy or of retail sales. Thus, the very publishers that have sued Google have seen their revenues grow faster than retail sales or the U.S. economy as a whole (measured by gross domestic product). This finding parallels some of the research that has been done since the Napster case on the economic impact of peer-to-peer file sharing on sales of recorded music. Future studies may provide a more granular estimate of the economic impact of frequent downloads or displays of pages of particular books on the sales of such books.

TI An overview of Law 19/2014 of 29 December, on transparency, access to
   public information and good governance
SO ACTIVITAT PARLAMENTARIA
LA Catalan
DT Article
AB In recent years, citizens have become aware that public information is vital to participating in public affairs, monitoring the institutions managing them, and preventing and fighting against corruption. This explains why social pressure to access this public information has increased gradually, and why, after a long wait, it has obtained an appropriate regulatory response.
   In this context, the new law on transparency, access to public information and good governance both on the part of the basic state legislator (Law 19/2013) and the Catalan Parliament (Law 19/2014), represents the adjustment of the domestic legal order to international standards. In particular, it means enshrining the right of access to public information as a new subjective right of citizens, which is usually deemed to be essentially fundamental. Law 19/2014 of 29 December, on transparency, access to public information and good governance, has outweighed the basic state law in terms of power and ambition, and is set to have a major impact on institutions and society as a whole. It is undoubtedly one of the most important laws passed by the Catalan Parliament in many years, and one that will mark a turning point in Catalan public law.
   In the article, the author analyses two essential pillars of this law. The first is active advertising, involving a duty to publish public information automatically without citizens having to ask explicitly. Second is the right of access to public information, which is established as a new subjective right of citizens covered extensively in Catalan law, although with legal limitations allowing the denial of full or partial access when it could clearly damage other legally protected goods or interests, including the necessary protection of personal data. The interaction and balance between these rights will pose significant challenges, both in the theoretical and practical enforcement of the legal provisions.
   The article also highlights the relationship that transparency and access to public information have with "good governance", which is identified in the Law with the ethical behaviour of senior officials, quality public services and quality regulations, and "open government", in reference to increasing interaction between citizens and government. Other sections in this analysis of the new law are related to the regulation of lobbies or interest groups, and the establishment of a system of guarantees. This includes the creation of the Committee for the Guarantee of the Right of Access to Public Information and the provision of a specific sanctioning regime and techniques for internal and external assessment of the Law.
   In conclusion, the article discusses the challenges posed in the deployment and enforcement of Law 19/2014 by the Government, from investing in technological solutions to developing new formal and informal procedures, and creating awareness among and training officials and civil servants.

AB Increased citizen participation in policy processes through voluntary civic associations warrants an analysis of their effectiveness, which this article undertakes using a multiple constituency framework. We find a gap in the literature on nonprofit effectiveness where theoretical and empirical studies have mainly focused on organizations that directly provide tangible goods and services. We propose a multiple constituency approach to evaluate and understand the implications for assessing the organizational effectiveness of community-based advisory civic associations. We empirically analyze the evaluation of Los Angeles neighborhood councils by three different constituency groups-citizen participants, street-level bureaucrats, and city council staffs. We find that the effectiveness ratings of the constituency groups are dissimilar on different dimensions of effectiveness. These findings suggest that the multiple constituency framework holds theoretical and practical value for understanding the organizational effectiveness of voluntary associations, where the different goals of various stakeholders lead to different views on effectiveness.

DT Article
DE Japan; "the 1955 system"; Liberal Democratic Party; dominant party
   model; conservatism; consensus
AB The article discusses the characteristic features of the party system in Japan in 1955-1993, which give the grounds to describe its distinctive nature as a dominant party model that was unique to the global historical experience of democratic countries.
   Special attention is paid to the unique toolkit used by the Liberal Democratic Party to preserve its dominant positions in the Diet. An emphasis is put on the electoral technologies, and, first of all, on the personalistic orientation of Japanese voters, as well as on the lobbying capabilities of influential LDP MPs, which provided them with significant advantages in electoral mobilization. The personality-oriented relationship with electors allowed the LDP to recruit representatives of various social strata. The feedback mechanisms of the ruling party with the society made it possible for the LDP to effectively address increasingly complicated interests and values of individual social groups and strata by means of a consolidated state policy.
   The ruling party created a powerful political planning apparatus and maintained close ties with the bureaucracy. An important role in the system of power of the LDP was played by the mechanisms of inner-party democracy and the pluralism of opinions, ensuring a consensus within the party ranks based on the interfactional balance of power.
   The article gives several reasons for the end of the era of the "1955 system". First of all, due to the collapse of the USSR and the end of the bipolarity era, the dividing line of ideological confrontation between parties disappeared. Another reason was the fact that, by the end of the 1980s, due to the change of the model of economic development, it became impossible to finance numerous infrastructure projects in depressed regions of Japan, resulting in substantially decreased role of political authorities as the subject of redistribution of surplus social product. Electoral psychology had also changed, and the traditional methods of mobilizing votes used by the LDP had lost their effectiveness. Finally, a certain role was played by mass discontent with the ruling party, associated with the rapid expansion of political corruption, in which the entirety of the LDP leadership was involved.

ID IRAQ
AB By 1942, Loyal Davis had firmly established himself as a preeminent civilian neurosurgeon. With military operations rapidly escalating, he was recruited to serve in the European Theater of Operations as a consultant to the Surgeon General. Davis brought tremendous experience, insight, and leadership to this position; however, he found the military system in which he was suddenly immersed inefficient and impassive. His requests for even basic equipment became mired in endless bureaucracy even as his communiques to the Chief Surgeon in the European Theater and to the Surgeon General's staff in Washington seemed to fall short of their intended recipients. Then, when he attempted to vent his frustrations to his academic colleagues, he was nearly court-martialed. Notwithstanding, Davis became the first to formally recognize high-altitude frostbite and also developed protective headgear for airmen, and later in his service, he joined a contingent of senior medical leaders who visited the Soviet Union to study their system of combat casualty care. Subsequent to his service on active duty, Davis returned to his academic practice at Northwestern where he used his position as editor of Surgery, Gynecology, and Obstetrics to advocate for change within the military medical corps. Others like Davis have contributed greatly to the advancement of combat casualty care both during active service and long after their time in uniform. This paper examines the lessons from Davis's experiences as a military neurosurgeon and his continued advocacy for change in the medical corps along with additional recent examples of change effected by former military surgeons. For those currently serving, these lessons illustrate the value of contributing wherever a need is recognized, and for those who have served in the past, they demonstrate the importance of having a continued voice with junior combat surgeons and the military leadership.

TI BEYOND THE BOSSES' CONSTITUTION: THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND CLASS
   ENTRENCHMENT
SO COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The Supreme Court's "weaponized" First Amendment has been its strongest antiregulatory tool in recent decades, slashing campaign-finance regulation, public-sector union financing, and pharmaceutical regulation, and threatening a broader remit. Along with others, I have previously criticized these developments as a "new Lochnerism." In this Essay, part of a Columbia Law Review Symposium, I press beyond these criticisms to diagnose the ideological outlook of these opinions and to propose an alternative. The leading decisions of the antiregulatory First Amendment often associate free speech with a vision of market efficiency; but, I argue, closer to their heart is antistatist fear of entrenchment by elected officials, interest groups, and bureaucrats. These opinions limit the power of government to implement distributional judgments in key areas of policy and, by thus tying the government's hands, constrain opportunities for entrenchment. This antidistributive deployment of market-protecting policy is the signature of neoliberal jurisprudence.
   But this jurisprudence has deep problems in an order of capitalist democracy such as ours. Whenever the state cannot implement distributional judgments, markets will do so instead. Market distributions are, empirically speaking, highly unequal, and these inequalities produce their own kind of entrenchment-class entrenchment for the wealthy. A jurisprudence that aims at government neutrality by tying the distributional hands of the state cannot achieve neutrality but instead implicitly sides with market inequality over distinctively democratic forms of equality. Once we see that any constitutional vision involves some relationship between the "democratic" and the "capitalist" parts of capitalist democracy, it becomes possible not just to criticize the Court's siding with market winners but also to ask what kinds of equality-pursuing policies the Constitution must permit to reset that balance in favor of democracy.

ID ADVOCACY COALITION FRAMEWORK; POLICY CHANGE
AB Considerable research has highlighted the corollary between scientific theory and ICM application. Debates are principally focused on: policy formulation; non-linearity of process; sound research underpinning coastal solutions; and overt influences. Consequently, clearly identified theoretical implementation frameworks for ICM, incorporating scientifically informed goals, are needed. From a theoretical review and semi-structured interviews with representatives from supranational, national and local government/quasi government organisations in South Wales, an ICM implementation model was developed. Based on a synthesis of top-down and bottom-up policy implementation theory, the model presents four sub sections. Firstly, policy formulation and guiding influences of fixed and unstable factors are addressed. Secondly, the implementation stage assesses the relationship between various actors, including mandarins, target groups and street level bureaucrats. Thirdly, the model distinguishes between policy output and outcome, with particular emphasis on the science and policy link. Finally, the role of policy evaluation and feedback makes the model a cyclical process. It showed that a universal ICM model of implementation is beyond present theoretical knowledge. However, the model enables a fuller appreciation of the policy process and its complex nature, so that goals, tools, instruments and actors can combine to ensure excellence in application and efficiency.

ID SELF-DETERMINATION; ADVOCACY ROLE; PERSPECTIVE
AB Social workers, especially those in health care and rehabilitation systems, must consider practice changes necessitated by recent legislation and the growing activism of disability rights groups. The authors review essential elements of the emerging sense of both oppression and empowerment that is occurring for many people with disabilities and groups; consider key aspects of ADA and other pertinent legislation that place new emphases on the self-determination of people with disabilities; and discuss what implications changing practice roles might have for social workers' relationships and patterns of interaction with ether professionals in medical, health care and rehabilitation settings. The authors outline a beginning effort at designing a conceptual framework that promotes practice that: (1) maximizes clients' involvement in exploring an expanded range of options and choices; (2) prepares clients to be more effective in dealings with professionals, bureaucrats and agencies that often do not understand nor appreciate their need for self-determination; and (3) at the organizing level, mobilizes and helps to empower groups of people with disabilities to consider policy and program alternatives that can improve their situation. This framework may also be useful in work with people who have other long term care needs, chronic conditions, etc. (C) 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

ID REFUGEE CHILDREN; MENTAL-HEALTH; WAR; THERAPIES; DISASTER; YOUTH; RISK
AB Artbooks, which are a combined form of picture and story book created using mixed media, can be a simple yet powerful way of supporting children affected by war and displacement to tell their stories. They allow children to work through the creative arts, which protects them from being overwhelmed by difficult memories. They also allow, even very young children, to show us how they cope with past violence and present injustice by recalling and representing the small everyday overcomings of their lives - a garden they planted in DRC, a mother who walks them across a busy Johannesburg street, a curtain blowing in the door of their new home - just as it did in their old home. The books allow them to witness to the injustice of xenophobic violence by neighbours and the immoveable bureaucracy attached to accessing documents, through representing the small details of their lives in crayons and paint. Making artbooks also allows for some measure of meaning-making in the chaos of the everyday in a hostile city where their parents struggle to maintain a normal life for them. Books are also a powerful way for children to safely share their stories and advocate for changed attitudes, laws and policies in the increasingly migrant-hostile South African society. The article will tell the story of a book-making project run over a number of years at a community counselling centre that works with families on the move in Johannesburg South Africa. It will also describe how some of the children's books have become a powerful advocacy tool through their inclusion in the digital library of the African Storybook project. The article will explore some of the practical details of the project and the theory around the power of the representation of the everyday which we are beginning to derive from the work.

ID INFORMAL PAYMENTS; POLITICAL CORRUPTION; AGENCY THEORY; CARE REFORM;
   FRAUD; ABUSE; WASTE
AB Recent scholarly attention has focused on weak governance and the negative effects of corruption on the provision of health services. Employing agency theory, this article discusses corruption in the South African health sector. We used a combination of research methods and triangulated data from three sources: Auditor-General of South Africa reports for each province covering a 9-year period; 13 semi-structured interviews with health sector key informants and a content analysis of print media reports covering a 3-year period. Findings from the Auditor-General reports showed a worsening trend in audit outcomes with marked variation across the nine provinces. Key-informants indicated that corruption has a negative effect on patient care and the morale of healthcare workers. The majority of the print media reports on corruption concerned the public health sector (63%) and involved provincial health departments (45%). Characteristics and complexity of the public health sector may increase its vulnerability to corruption, but the private-public binary constitutes a false dichotomy as corruption often involves agents from both sectors. Notwithstanding the lack of global validated indicators to measure corruption, our findings suggest that corruption is a problem in the South African healthcare sector. Corruption is influenced by adverse agent selection, lack of mechanisms to detect corruption and a failure to sanction those involved in corrupt activities. We conclude that appropriate legislation is a necessary, but not sufficient intervention to reduce corruption. We propose that mechanisms to reduce corruption must include the political will to run corruption-free health services, effective government to enforce laws, appropriate systems, and citizen involvement and advocacy to hold public officials accountable. Importantly, the institutionalization of a functional bureaucracy and public servants with the right skills, competencies, ethics and value systems and whose interests are aligned with health system goals are critical interventions in the fight against corruption.

DT Article
DE Civilizations; Developmental dynamics; Transformation; Shared sense;
   Sustainable society
AB Civilizations begin to fall apart once they start losing the ability to find a creative response to major challenges. Often, a failure in creativity follows a period of major civilization successes. After two hundred years of scientific and technological development, and wealth accumulation, we should therefore be cautious. Maybe we are the last generation of the old civilization, and the first generation of the new civilization. It is important to diagnose the key patterns of changes the moment they emerge so that we can later influence them. There are many signs indicating we are now entering the stage of a civilization crisis, e.g. an indebted and stagnating economy, an increase in social atomization, special interest groups whose influence outweighs the public interest, an enormous bureaucracy, and an inability to respond to local and global environmental problems. The crucial challenge is to find a new "shared sense" - a new sense of reality, human identity and social purpose, which we could share and which would respect our radically changing circumstances. If we are to ponder the challenge to find a new shared sense thoroughly and honestly, we cannot avoid the elementary questions accompanying the pilgrimage of human life: Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going? Probably the most important event to have happened in the last 2,000 years is the fact that we are beginning to know our own story - from the Big Bang to the present, including indications of the future. The future of our civilization and/or society is not predetermined or set in stone. We have the freedom of choice.

AB Background Tobacco control policies affecting the point of sale (POS) are an emerging intervention, yet POS-related news media content has not been studied.
   Purpose We describe news coverage of POS tobacco control efforts and assess relationships between article characteristics, including policy domains, frames, sources, localisation and evidence present, and slant towards tobacco control efforts.
   Methods High circulation state (n= 268) and national (n= 5) newspapers comprised the sampling frame. We retrieved 917 relevant POS-focused articles in newspapers from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2014. 5 raters screened and coded articles, 10% of articles were double coded, and mean inter-rater reliability (IRR) was 0.74.
   Results POS coverage emphasised tobacco retailer licensing (49.1% of articles) and the most common frame present was regulation (71.3%). Government officials (52.3%), followed by tobacco retailers (39.6%), were the most frequent sources. Half of articles (51.3%) had a mixed, neutral or antitobacco control slant. Articles presenting a health frame, a greater number of protobacco control sources, and statistical evidence were significantly more likely to also have a protobacco control slant. Articles presenting a political/rights or regulation frame, a greater number of antitobacco control sources, or government, tobacco industry, tobacco retailers, or tobacco users as sources were significantly less likely to also have a protobacco control slant.
   Conclusions Stories that feature procontrol sources, research evidence and a health frame also tend to support tobacco control objectives. Future research should investigate how to use data, stories and localisation to encourage a protobacco control slant, and should test relationships between content characteristics and policy progression.

AB International organizations (I0) have centralized their public communication to a large extent over recent decades by undertaking a broader codification of communication tasks as well as a departmentalization of these tasks within units of IO bureaucracies. The paper provides the first systematic analysis of this important development in institutional design using a novel data set on the organization of public communication in 48 IOs between 1950 and 2015. It identifies self-legitimation as a key driver of centralization in the face of increased levels of politicization, that is, public awareness and activism directed at IOs. Empirically, the study suggests that the centralization of public communication significantly increases as transnational civil society organizes and gains access to IO decision-making. Further, politicization in terms of contentious activism and public scandals substantially accounts for varying levels of centralization across IOs.

ID IDENTITY
AB The article argues that the 'crisis of Europe', triggered by market and governance dysfunctionalities (summarized as the Euro crisis), represents a 'critical moment' in the evolution of a European society. This society so far does not offer much resistance to such critical moments which is due to its incapacity to form a demos capable of acting together. The existing European society - and this is the basic claim - is nothing but the sum of individuals living in 'sub-European' (mainly national) groups. The evolution triggered by this critical situation opens pathways to turn these peoples of Europe into something more than being a sum of peoples governed by supranational bureaucracies. To decipher such processes a model is presented using Hirschman's idea of exit, voice and loyalty as mechanisms to generate social ties. Two points arise as crucial. The first is the observation that national societies which continue to provide foundational claims for people have turned into interest groups in the context of the European Union. This undermines not only the ontological nationalism still dominating the self-presentation of national societies in Europe, but it also offers evolutionary paths towards a society beyond national foundational claims in Europe. Yet it also provokes reactive processes such as the return to the self-contained nation (or even ethnic group). This is the core of the crisis of Europe. The systemic crises of the state and the market in Europe are speeding up an evolutionary process of people-making, the outcome of which could be either the regression to a people with foundational identities or to a people without foundational identities. The latter will be described as a postnational society, which would make an emerging European society the first really modern society.

   Analysis of Issue Interpretation in Risk Policy Related to Mad Cow

ID KNOWLEDGE; FALL
AB The "Risk Society" as Ulrich Beck (Beck, Ulrich. 1992. Risk society: Towards a new modernity. London, UK: Sage, Beck, Ulrich. 1999. World risk society. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press) has called modern society, has changed the policy dynamics of many highrisk policies. Policy conflicts occur due to both physically objective risks and socially constructed risks. Risk politicization means that issue expansion and attention cycles are likely to be related to the social construction of policy images. An interesting case in point concerns the risk perception about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) among four groups of people in South Korea: bureaucrats, citizens, scientists, and interest groups. We develop expectations about how the four groups will frame the political issues based on their roles and concerns in the policy process. Downs' (Downs, Anthony. 1972. Up and down with ecology: The issueattention cycle. Public Interest 28: 3850) work on the issueattention cycle suggests how issues rise and fall on the public agenda, and our work also directly tests his theses. This study uses semantic network analysis based on content analysis of key words in 6 400 articles published in 2008 to construct semantic networks for the four stakeholder groups over four stages in the policy process. Through this unique data analysis, we can see the major issue concerns and intensity of each of the four groups in the four policy stages by assessing the key words each group uses in the media articles and the visualizations of their semantic associations. We do find distinct differences in what issues each of the four groups focus on and how the focus of substance changes in each of the four policy stages that clarify how these groups framed the BSE policy issues. Our results both confirm and raise doubts about some predictions from the issueattention cycle. Citizens' attention follows closely to Downs' predictions, whereas the other stakeholders' issueattention cycles do not follow Downs' predictions as well. Finally, our study explains and demonstrates the value of semantic network analysis as a powerful method for understanding issue framing in the policy process.

TI The US Global Gag Rule in Ethiopia: a foreign policy challenging
   domestic sexual and reproductive health and rights gains
SO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

AB Plain language summary In 2005, Ethiopia's government, health advocates, and service providers secured a more liberal abortion law that has been instrumental in reducing maternal deaths due to unsafe abortion. However, these fragile gains are vulnerable because the in-country sexual and reproductive health sector has relied heavily on external funding. The U.S. government has been an important development partner to Ethiopia for global health and, in particular, reproductive health and family planning. As a result, the Global Gag Rule, reimposed and expanded by the Trump administration in 2017, impacted sexual and reproductive health and rights in Ethiopia. U.S. agencies and departments attached this policy to U.S. global health assistance for nongovernmental organizations that were critical partners in service delivery and advocacy. In a country like Ethiopia with a progressive environment for sexual and reproductive health, including safe abortion care, it remains important to examine the impacts of the Global Gag Rule, despite being rescinded in January 2021 by the Biden administration, as the policy has still not yet been permanently repealed and could be reinstated by future administrations. PAI's research sought to document the impacts of the expanded Global Gag Rule on sexual and reproductive health in Ethiopia, with a focus on safe abortion care. Study participants reported that nongovernmental organizations serving rural populations, adolescents and youth, sex workers, and people living with HIV/AIDS were impacted by the loss of U.S. government funding due to noncompliance with the policy. Organizations that chose to comply with the policy were forced to stop critical activities like training on safe abortion care. Outcomes also included self-censorship out of fear of the policy and dismantled partnerships between compliant and noncompliant organizations.
   Background Ethiopia's government and civil society have driven crosscutting initiatives in the last 15 years to improve sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including passing a 2005 abortion law that facilitated reduced rates of maternal death due to unsafe abortion. However, both the government and nongovernmental organizations have relied on external funding for sexual and reproductive health and rights, particularly from the U.S. government, which has been Ethiopia's largest global health donor. This article explores how the implementation and expansion of the 2017-2021 U.S. foreign policy "Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance," also known as the Global Gag Rule-which attached itself to a nongovernmental organization's funding-impacted sexual and reproductive health and rights, including safe abortion care, in Ethiopia. Methods This article is based on research conducted by PAI staff in Ethiopia in 2018 with follow-up in 2019. PAI held in-depth semistructured interviews with representatives of 30 organizations in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. Among these groups were U.S.-based and non-U.S. nongovernmental organizations, including community-based organizations, non-U.S. government donors, and Ethiopian government officials. Results Nongovernmental organizations have been essential to sexual and reproductive health service provision and advocacy in Ethiopia. Because of the sector's reliance on U.S. global health assistance, these organizations; their activities; and, consequently, the wider health system were negatively impacted by the Global Gag Rule. Certain vulnerable groups, particularly adolescents and youth, have traditionally relied on the private sector for sexual and reproductive health services. PAI's research demonstrates that U.S. policy disrupted activities and service delivery, threatened the closure of private clinics, stalled mobile outreach, and impacted safe abortion training of health personnel. Additionally, the Global Gag Rule dismantled partnerships, affected non-U.S. government donors' investments, and caused confusion that limited activities permissible under the policy. Conclusions The Trump administration's Global Gag Rule forced non-U.S. organizations to choose between providing comprehensive care or losing U.S. global health assistance, ultimately impacting populations in need of services. Ethiopia provides a clear example of how the Global Gag Rule can threaten a country's domestic health agenda by targeting nongovernmental organizations that are vital to health service delivery and safe abortion care.

AB Simple Summary African lion cubs are used in South Africa in wildlife-interaction tourism (cub petting). The welfare impacts on the cubs are unclear. A workshop was held with 15 lion-experienced stakeholders who all indicated a range of welfare concerns for discussion and prioritisation. The leading welfare concern identified was the 'lack of governance and regulation' within the industry. Participants also agreed on nine non-negotiable practices that affect cubs' welfare. Some of these included ethical concerns, such as cubs exiting into the ranching industry (farming of lions for hunting) and the bone trade (lions being slaughtered for their bones, which are exported for lion bone wine) once petting age has passed. Current industry practices were then ranked and weighted for welfare importance through an online survey completed by 60 industry stakeholders. This survey identified the most important welfare concerns to be poor social grouping of cubs, an inability for cubs to choose their own environment and retreat from an interaction, a lack of trained and dedicated caretakers, and poor breeding practices. The survey results produced a user-friendly tool to score cubs' welfare in interaction facilities and also identified current practices that are lacking in welfare consideration. African lion (Panthera leo) cubs are extensively used in South Africa in wildlife-interaction tourist activities. Facilities provide close interaction opportunities, but the welfare impacts on the cubs are unclear. A workshop was held with 15 lion-experienced stakeholders, including government officials, nature conservationists, animal welfare organisations, lion breeders, lion handlers, an animal ethologist, wildlife veterinarian, wildlife rehabilitation specialist and an animal rights advocacy group representative. Individual representatives nominated a range of welfare concerns, and 15 were identified for discussion and prioritisation. The leading welfare concern was a lack of governance and regulation within the industry. Participants agreed on nine non-negotiable practices affecting welfare concerns, which included ethical concerns, such as cubs exiting into the ranching industry (farming of lions for hunting) and the bone trade (lions being slaughtered for their bones, which are exported for lion bone wine) once petting age has passed. Welfare concerns representative of current management practices within the lion cub interaction industry were compared for importance using an online adaptive conjoint analysis survey of 60 stakeholders in the industry. The survey identified the most important welfare concerns to be poor social grouping of cubs, an inability for cubs to choose their own environment and retreat from a forced interaction, a lack of trained and dedicated caretakers, and poor breeding practices. The conjoint analysis survey results produced a value model, which can be used as a tool to score cubs' welfare in interaction facilities, and it identified unacceptable practices lacking welfare consideration.

AB This article deals with the Israeli land policy in light of a certain judicial decision made by the Israeli High Court of justice (HCJ). A decision known as the "Land decision" (2002). Following the concept of shared mental models I will claim that the ruling of the HCJ at the given point in time expresses societal preferences formed through a process of learning through which society develops a shared mental model of 'alternative behavior' that reflects the way in which individuals and groups adapt to solve the social problems they face in various contexts. This shared mental model provides a frame of reference for the actions of political players such as politicians, special interest groups as well as the Supreme Court in shaping the design and implementation of Israel' land policy. However regarding the Israeli land decision the ability of the Supreme Court to determine policy is limited on the implementation level. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article analyzes prisoners' accounts of human rights violations and protections in two types of prisons in the Dominican Republic: "new" prisons that uphold goals of rights and rehabilitation and "old" prisons that mostly warehouse people. This mixed-methods study finds that prisoners experience significant violence, mostly by other prisoners in old facilities and mostly by corrections staff in new facilities, with different rationales and possible responses. I consider three types of recourse mechanisms: top-down (courts or external commissions), bottom-up (advocacy), and internal institutional (grievance processes and human rights training). I argue that each of these carries constraints, and prisoners perceive official channels to favor the institution. The prevalence of rights violations and the narrow recourse options generate cynicism and frustration among prisoners and their families, which can undermine the legitimacy gained through other important improvements in the reform process.

TI Strong government responses? Reflections on the management of COVID-19
   in Hong Kong and Taiwan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE COVID-19; Government responses; Taiwan; Hong Kong
ID LESSONS
AB Purpose A debate emerged among members of public administration academia soon after COVID-19 appeared on the roles and measures that governments ought to deploy to prevent infection. One prevalent discourse is the strength of "strong government" in the fight against the virus-the administrative capacity to launch prompt, appropriate and effective actions that entail collaboration with citizens. A notable development in governance is that new public management (NPM) principles, such as the value of money and the pluralisation of service delivery, are gradually put aside when governments urgently need to curb the spread of infection. The roles of bureaucracy and centralised action are re-emphasised in the policymaking and implementation of anti-epidemic measures. Such a trend allows us to examine if the COVID-19 public health crisis has fundamentally reversed the trend of government retreat in public service within neoliberal regimes since the 1980s. Design/methodology/approach For this research, the authors selected two "strong governments" in Asia-Hong Kong and Taiwan-by showing how administrators outline their anti-pandemic strategies, examining the role of government in coordinating responses and how bureaucracy interacts with the other two key domains of the governance mechanism: civil society and the market. These two offshore Chinese capitalist economies and pluralistic societies are perceived to have "strong government capacity" in the fight against COVID-19, presumably as a key attribute to their success confining the spread of infection during the early stages of the first outbreak. Both societies reported low infection rates and low mortality rates until September 2020. The authors browsed databases developed by scholars (Cheng et al., 2020; Hale et al., 2020) and referred to two "rubrics" to assess and compare government actions in both places in response to COVID-19. The authors itemised, categorised and counted the policy actions in both places according to the rubrics, noticed that the policy footprint appeared in over two-thirds of indicators of proactive government interventions and identified double-digit counts in nearly half of the categories. Findings The authors found that both governments attempted to establish strong stewardship and quick measures to contain the infection. The pattern of "strong government" is, however, not the same as that superficially exhibited. Taiwan took limited steps to regulate business activities but proactively intervened and coordinated the supply of hygienic utilities. Hong Kong launched aggressive attempts to reduce human mobility but remained non-active despite the "face mask run" in society. The "strong government" aspect also received divergent reactions from society. There was extensive cross-sectoral collaboration under the centralised "National Team" advocacy in Taiwan, and there has been no record of local infection for over 10 months. The Hong Kong government was repeatedly doubted for its undesirable stewardship in anti-epidemic measures, the effectiveness of policy interventions and the impartiality of law enforcement. Spontaneous actions during the health crisis from civil societies and private markets were noted, but they seemed uncoordinated with official attempts. Originality/value The initial findings enable us to rethink correlations between state capacity and legitimacy in the fight against the virus and its development post-COVID-19.
   Apparently, Taiwan and Hong Kong demonstrated a "re-expansion" of their public sector during the public health crisis, but not in the same format. This can be understood based on their varying regime values and administrative systems. The pandemic has been a catalyst, pushing both regimes back to their original track of public administration establishments. The concept of "path dependence" might explain the initial development and project the longer-term transformation of the public sector in both places.

AB This article examines how a Spanish telecom giant legitimizes its market expansion through a corporate social responsibility (CSR) narrative that links generic notions of technological innovation and children's rights to projects of development and democracy. At a broad level, I explore how the neoliberal privatization of the telecommunications industry has involved a reconfiguration of corporate-state relations rather than an erasure of the state in corporate discourse. I trace how Telefonica accrues currency as a digital pioneer and provider of a social good by incorporating consumers, state actors, and other corporations into its moral apparatus. My point of entry is a smartphone application that the company's Colombian subsidiary developed and subsequently gamified to empower consumer-citizens to end street-based child labor. Within a digital economy of "instant gratification" and national context of securitization, the process whereby consumers are interpellated as citizen-activists highlights the thin line between profiling techniques and humanitarian action, and between surveillance and activism, while disguising the limits of the state bureaucracy and the company's own distance from its purported beneficiaries. Ultimately, I show how the company maintained its narrative about its innovative and sustainable commitment to children even when explaining the failures of its CSR strategy.

AB We develop a model of pork-barrel politics in which a government official tries to improve her reelection chances by spending on targeted interest groups. The spending signals that she shares their concerns. We investigate the effect of such pandering on public spending. Pandering increases spending relative to a non-accountable official (one who does not have to run for reelection) if either the official's overall spending propensity is known, or if it is unknown but the effect of spending on the deficit is opaque to voters. By contrast, an unknown spending propensity may induce the elected official to exhibit fiscal discipline if spending is transparent. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper identities features of well-known planning modes affecting the likelihood of manipulation. Results from social choice theory and the economic theory of organisation help to explain why certain combinations of planning styles and organisational characteristics stimulate or hamper manipulation. Although the planning process can be rigged in many ways, false revelation of preferences and strategic agenda formation are primarily studied here. When each decisionmaker can rank the alternatives any way he or she wants, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem states that manipulation-free procedures for making recommendations do not exist unless cyclical decisions or high concentrations of power are accepted. In general, a low probability of cyclical recommendations and a strong organisational bias favouring certain interests and alternatives reduce the likelihood of successful manipulation. It is argued that these conditions are present particularly in advocacy planning and-perhaps counterintuitively-to some extent in disjointed incrementalism.

AB The amount of privately conserved land is increasing worldwide. The potential of these areas to contribute to the global conservation of biodiversity is significant, given that statutory protected areas alone will not suffice. Nevertheless, there is still inadequate support for private conservation areas, and further research on appropriate, flexible, and generally applicable incentive measures is necessary. We conducted 25 semistructured interviews with the owners of private conservation areas in the Little Karoo, South Africa, to examine landowner opinions of existing conservation policies and their relationships with the local conservation authority. We also assessed landowner preferences regarding conservation incentive measures. Landowners doubted the conservation authority's capacity to implement its stewardship program and were also discouraged by the bureaucracy of the program. The conservation authority was often viewed negatively, except where landowners had experienced personal contact from conservation staff or where strong social capital had formed among landowners. Landowners did not desire financial rewards for their conservation efforts, but sought recognition of their stewardship role and greater involvement from the conservation authority through personal contact. We conclude that conservation policies for private lands could benefit from the provision of extension services to landowners, promotion of formation of groups of landowners and other stakeholders, and public acknowledgment of the contributions private conservation areas make.

SO RUSSIAN REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID LIBRARIES; RELIGION
AB Although the relationship between Russian government and society in the nineteenth century is often portrayed in terms of conflict, cooperation was more typically the rule. The tsarist state encouraged, sanctioned and patronized private associations dedicated to the pursuit of national betterment and the prestige of the realm. The interests of state and society appeared to be shared interests, and on many projects monarchy and officialdom were willing to collaborate with private individuals. However, the increasing civic activism of private associations during the second half of the nineteenth century challenged the authorities' ability to control the public sphere, and the relationship between state and society turned gradually from cooperation to conflict. We may chart the trajectory from cooperation to confrontation by examining the Free Economic Society's involvement in education. Although the government bureaucracy, the zemstvos, and teachers' professional organizations have received the attention of historians, less is known about the work of Russia's science societies. The involvement of private associations in popular education during the second half of the nineteenth century demonstrates the opportunities, as well as the limitations, of nongovernmental public action. An examination of a division of the Free Economic Society known as the Literacy Committee will also provide a case study of the interaction between officialdom, an association, and the broader public as well as an example of the horizontal linkages in society that associations facilitated. The initial partnership between state and society turned into conflict, as the Literacy Committee spearheaded a rise in public activity in the 1890s. This civic activism, as well as the claim of the Literacy Committee's leaders to a voice in public policy, raised the specter of a vast archipelago of unauthorized and unscrutinized public initiative in education; conflict more and more entered into the relationship between government and society. By operating in a legally sanctioned public sphere and by mobilizing a public, the Literacy Committee, along with other education associations, the zemstvos and the city councils, were a lever used by activists in an attempt to wrest education from government tutelage. However constrained by the government, participation in nongovernmental associations gave the public a voice and allowed activists to challenge government tutelage. Using the vehicle of the association, Russian education activists framed public opinion, organized public meetings around issues of concern, and claimed an advocacy role in public policy.

AB In this study the author explores the connection between good governance and social capital, with a focus on the case of Romania. A new governance arrangements which are helpful in generating change in government means giving up old paradigms and accepting some innovative approaches in which citizens are, at the same time, co-participants in the decision processes regarding the new development of the community they benefit from. Focusing on results expresses the need for the creation of a strategic vision of the expected outcome, vision which takes into consideration, on the one hand, making the best out of the positive influences of external factors, and on the other hand, reducing (eliminating) the threats coming from latter. This construction represents a potential solution based on co-operation between governments (centrally, regionally, and locally), civil society association and other stakeholders such as media and business. There is an urgent demand to make the central and local administration structures more efficient (for them to become compatible with the flexible structure of the meta-organization) and to limit the decision-making capacity of the administrations by involving citizens and interest groups representative for the community in the decision-making process.
   The conclusion of the study, based on empirical data, is that for now social capital does not represent a support for governance. Even more, we believe that the current situation in Romania leads to the consolidation of authoritarianism and rigid bureaucratic structures.
   This research focuses on identifying those mechanisms of local governance able to innovation the governance arrangement and building the social capital in a way as for governments to share public responsibilities with all the representative actors of the community (e.g. politicians, bureaucrats, members of community or representatives of the community's interests). In terms of this research, our hypothesis is that governments might well develop their own characteristic culture of innovation, so we are interested in any normative and strategic characteristics that unite the whole government and distinguish them from others. In order to cope with passing from government to governance, the political leaders must show political maturity, both in order to promote changes of the institutional arrangements by involving social capital, and to stimulate its construction. The research was conducted for almost one year and refers to the Romanian public organizations. It is based on a complex methodology that includes both quantitative methods for data collection as well as qualitative methods for processing the statistical outcomes.

AB The monetary unification in Europe- the establishment of a single currency for all members of the European Union - has been conceptualized and promoted mainly in economic terms. The economics of monetary unification analyze the (mainly economic) costs and benefits that member states draw from replacing multiple national currencies with a single currency. The political factor has been habitually put aside as the benevolent despot view of the government was tacitly embraced with regard to the creation of the monetary union. Similarly, the process of euro adoption by countries that entered the European Union (EU) later is usually described as being driven by economic factors. The process of nominal and real convergence with older members has been carefully analyzed. Much less weight has been put on the complex interaction of economic and political dimensions during preparations for euro adoption, such as the political interests of national governments and their relation with major internal economic players. The multifaceted interplay of economic and political factors suggests the opportunity to take a political economy perspective on this complex issue. In this sense, a number of key political-economy related issues can be distilled in relation to the process of euro adoption, which will structure the following analysis. What are the key national winners and losers of this possible event? What role has interest-groups pressure played in this process? Under what circumstances may bureaucracies such as the central bank body of experts act as a deterrent for the political end that is the common currency adoption? How are internationally exposed companies expected to behave and to promote their interests in relation to this event? What is the relative importance of the internal politics dynamic for euro adoption? We rely on process tracing to approach these questions for the Romanian case. Policy documents, newspaper articles, academic articles, economic indicators and elite interviews are used to create an analytical narrative based both on a one-point-in-time description of the situation and on a timeline that lists the sequence of some relevant events. We argue that a specific combination of economic and political factors leads to the failed euro adoption in Romania.

AB BACKGROUND - Far-reaching changes in the Swedish substance abuse treatment system (SAT) were proposed by a state-commissioned inquiry in 2011. The proposal implied a break with the social tradition of SAT. It was suggested that the treatment responsibility should be transferred from the municipal social services to the regional-level health care system; and that compulsory treatment in its present form (assessed by/paid for by social services, run by the state) should be abolished and become incorporated into coercive psychiatric care provided by health care. A lively debate arose, and the vast majority of stakeholders sought to articulate their arguments. AIM - The study analysed the development of Swedish SAT by examining the policy process from reform proposal to government bill in 2013. METHOD - Content analysis was used to analyse written comments on the proposal submitted to the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs by close to 200 stakeholders. The goal was to empirically chart and examine the arguments for and against as well as advocates and opponents of the reform. With the government bill at hand, we retrospectively sorted out the winning arguments in the now highly contested SAT field and which actors were able to influence the process. CONCLUSIONS - The article discloses that the mixed response and rather critical voices in most groups, including social/medical professions and government bureaucracy, helped block the responsibility shifts, and that reformations of subsystems like SAT are difficult to carry out as freestanding projects within larger systems of social and health care.

TI WHAT GIDEON DID
SO COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW

DT Article
ID CRIMINAL-PROCEDURE; DEFENSE COUNSEL; CIVIL-RIGHTS; JUSTICE; RETHINKING;
   ATTORNEYS; FUTURE; COURTS
AB Many accounts of Gideon v. Wainwright's legacy focus on what Gideon did not do-its doctrinal and practical limits. For constitutional theorists, Gideon imposed a preexisting national consensus upon a few "outlier" states, and therefore did not represent a dramatic doctrinal shift. For criminal procedure scholars, advocates, and journalists, Gideon has failed, in practice, to guarantee meaningful legal help for poor people charged with crimes.
   Drawing on original historical research, this Article instead chronicles what Gideon did-the doctrinal and institutional changes it inspired between 1963 and the early 1970s. Gideon shifted the legal profession's policy consensus on indigent defense away from a charity model toward a public model. By 1973, this new consensus had transformed criminal practice nationwide through the establishment of hundreds of public defender offices and the expansion of lawyers' presence in low-level criminal proceedings. This Article describes these changes primarily through the example of Massachusetts, while contextualizing that example with national comparisons.
   The broad outlines of these post-Gideon changes are familiar to legal scholars. But situating these changes in a longer historical context and tracing them in detail from the perspective of lawyers on the ground in the 1960s yields two insights that help to explain the seemingly permanent post-Gideon crisis in indigent defense. First, the post-Gideon transformation was indeed limited in its practical effects, but its limits derived not only from politics but also from history-and from the legal profession itself. Lawyers themselves, long before Gideon, framed indigent defense as low-status, low-pay, less-than-fully professional legal work. That framing survived even as private charities became post-Gideon public defenders. Second, the post Gideon transformation was also limited-or, perhaps, destined to be perceived as limited-by tensions inherent in the attempt to provide large-scale legal assistance through government bureaucracies. Characteristics now identified as symptoms of crisis-such as politically determined funding, ever-expanding caseloads, and triage advocacy-first appeared as innovations that lawyers perceived Gideon to require. As public defenders proliferated, so too did complaints that they were underfunded and overworked, and that they encouraged guilty pleas over trials.
   The origins of the indigent defense crisis lie not only in Gideon's neglect but also, paradoxically, in Gideon's transformative influence. This history lends some support to recent scholarly expressions of skepticism about Gideon, but it also provides some reasons for optimism: If the indigent defense crisis derives not only from intransigent political indifference but also from contingent choices made by lawyers, then lawyers may retain more power than they realize to mitigate the crisis.

AB Objective: Media plays a major role in inculcating positive changes or averting negative changes in health-related behaviors across populations. Although various mass media interventions have proven their effectiveness in changing individuals' behavior for various diseases and risk factors, current literature is limited regarding a conceptual framework/model for the prevention of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The present study describes the process of development and implementation of a comprehensive and need-based media strategy with an aim to generate politico-administrative support for strengthening hypertension services in the state of Punjab, India. Methods: The preparation of theoretical framework underwent two stages, that is, item generation and item reduction. The item generation involved extensive literature search, development of consensus among experts using Delphi technique and its validation. The item reduction involved the selection of models among existing communication and health promotion models, placement of items in the selected models and development of final conceptual framework model. Results: Based upon the review and expert's consensus, we zeroed in on three models of communication - communication campaign model, paid earned social owned model, and staircase model - in order to come up with the framework requisite for a systematic media strategy. The model focused upon context-specific messages involving both traditional and modern means and tools of communication. This model (conceptual framework) was the product of intense literature review followed by opinion of the experts from various disciplines such as medical professionals, public health specialists, communication experts, social scientists, politicians, bureaucrats, state-level representatives, media journalists and hypertensive patients. Conclusion: The present model can effectively be used by the program implementers, educators and policy makers in similar settings.

TI QUASI-INQUISITORIALISM: ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERENCE IN PRETRIAL CRIMINAL

SO NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW

AB Police and prosecutorial activities that take place long before a criminal trial are frequently critical to, even dispositive of, the accuracy and reliability of case disposition. At the same time, the regulatory touch of constitutional criminal procedure in the pretrial realm is insistently light. Proposals to address actual or risked deficiencies in this arena have proliferated in recent years, exemplified by pushes for social-science-rooted investigative best practices, for broader defense access to evidence prior to trial, for more oversight in plea bargaining, and so on. But in the face of these critiques, broad pretrial discretion largely reigns.
   A prevailing explanation for this state of affairs is rooted in our putative preference for an accusatory rather than inquisitorial system of criminal justice. And the leading solutions on offer frequently urge at least a partial turn away from adversarial obsession to embrace more inquisitorial traditions. The central argument of this Article is that this prevailing account is incomplete, and that the gaps have real world consequences for criminal justice reform. The Article uncovers an additional and consequential strain in the doctrinal narrative, one that depicts the pretrial world as the very inquisitorial, Continental mode that is so roundly rejected in the context of adjudication. This "quasi-inquisitorialism" in turn enables the Court to construct a separate realm of prosecutorial and police bureaucracy, professionalism, and expertise that purportedly fills the gap in judicial oversight. In addition to offering a fuller explanation of the structure of the Court's constitutional criminal procedure doctrine, this account aims for greater leverage for reform. The Article concludes by suggesting that exploiting this quasi-inquisitorial narrative might offer promising inroads-doctrinally, politically, or both-for reformed approaches to investigative oversight, pretrial discovery, and plea bargaining.

AB The author illustrates the utility of institutional labor economics and makes a case for a reconsideration of it. Two recent developments motivate this effort: the rise of New Personnel Economics (NPE) as a significant subfield of labor economics and the substantial shifts in work organization that have taken place since the 1990s. Understanding how and why firms have reorganized work opens the door for a renewed interest in institutional approaches. The author explains that the rules of institutional labor markets (ILMs) emerge from the competition between organizational interest groups unions, personnel professionals, and the government and competing views of firms' objectives, resulting in the rise of ILMs, the slow diffusion of High Performance Work Systems, strategies used to obtain a high level of commitment from workers, the use of contingent employees, and the spread of new promotion rules in response to equal employment opportunity pressures. As such, the role of power and influence in establishing work rules is of central concern, though more conventional NPE considerations also remain important.

AB In Ukraine, women constitute a third of all new HIV infections, and injection drug use accounts for nearly half of HIV infections among women. Women who use drugs (WWUD) often have diminished access to drug use treatment, HIV care, and other health and social services or underutilize women-specific services such as maternal health services. While interpersonal and contextual factors diminish access to and utilization of services among WWUD, rules, processes, and bureaucratic structures also systematically exclude women from accessing services and resources. Institutions, bureaucratic processes, and instruments of legibility such as documents regulate who can and cannot access services and raise questions about "deservingness." In this paper, we use the lens of bureaucracy to explore paperwork as a form of structural violence through its production of "legible" citizens, often through reinforcement of gender stereotypes and moral narratives of deservingness. Between December 2017 and October 2018, we interviewed 41 medical and social service providers and 37 WWUD in two Ukrainian cities. Our analysis revealed that requirements for internal passports and residency permits-the primary state apparatus through which rights to services are granted in Ukraine-compelled participants to continually render themselves visible to the state in order to receive services, despite financial, logistical and other challenges that undermined women's ability to obtain documents. These requirements exposed them to new forms of stigma and exclusion, such as reduced opportunities for employment and losing custody of children. Nongovernmental organizations, due to funding cuts, curtailed direct services such as support groups but became liaisons between clients and the state. They enforced new narratives of deservingness, such as the ability to define "good" behavior or reward social relationships with agency staff. Ukraine's current reforms to social safety net institutions present an opportunity to interrogate underlying assumptions about spheres of responsibility for the country's most marginalized and stigmatized groups.

LA English
DT Article
ID POLITICAL CONTROL; COMMITTEE POWER; TAX; DESIGN; POLICY; BUREAUCRATS;
   RULES
AB Congress regularly enacts legislation providing for redundant administrative programs. For example, there are more than one hundred federal programs for surface transportation, eighty-two programs to ensure teacher quality, eighty programs to promote domestic economic development, and forty-seven programs to provide employment and job-training services. Recent high-profile legislation - such as the financial-industry reform measure and the health care reform measure - add new programs without repealing existing ones directed at the same policy goals. Prior academic analyses generally have not considered why Congress pursues redundancy. This Article addresses that question through both theoretical and institutional analysis.
   The Article first constructs an organizational theory that attributes redundancy in administrative programs to the congressional committee system. Specifically, the Article demonstrates that two critical components of the existing committee system - fragmented jurisdictions and parliamentary prerogatives - systematically bias legislative outcomes in favor of redundancy. Building on leading theoretical accounts of congressional committees from political science, the Article then presents a cost-benefit analysis of this tendency toward redundancy. It shows that redundancy allows legislators to increase distributive favors for constituents and interest groups but that redundancy is also linked to the desirable pursuit of informational efficiency. Thus, the institutional structures facilitating redundancy have mixed effects.
   Consequently, the Article describes and analyzes specific institutional reforms that trade off these distributive costs and informational benefits. One approach would subject more legislative decisions to external advisory processes such as that used to close unneeded military facilities. A second and more promising approach would preserve existing committee jurisdictions but would scale back committees' parliamentary prerogatives, thereby encouraging redundancy in program design but discouraging redundancy in program implementation.

   BUREAUCRACY; MAKERS; COSTS; RISK; RULE
AB Notice and comment provisions in agency rulemaking provide an important mechanism for the public to contribute to policy. Yet there is limited research on how interest groups participate in this process. California's passage of an ergonomics standard in 1997, the only current state statute in the country, provides a useful, high salience policy case for examining public commentary. Between an initially proposed comprehensive standard and the enactment of a much weaker regulation occurred the largest public response in California's state Occupational Safety and Health Administration history. Through a detailed content analysis of the notice and comment submissions we identify features of participation and claims-making that differ between business and nonbusiness submissions. Business groups were the large majority of participants and also presented a disproportionate amount of evidence, using an "abstract-technical" policy frame to assert the illegitimacy of the ergonomics standard. Labor, public health organizations and private citizens represented less than one-third of the participants and relied primarily on experiential information and a "concretized-moral" characterization of policy issues in support of the standard. The existence of these distinct "interpretive communities" that mobilize different resources raises questions about whether public commentary can fulfill its purported "democratic accountability" purpose as well as underline the limitations of appealing to scientific expertise for solving complex policy problems.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the regional political regime on the example of Kemerovo Oblast. The article considers modern domestic and foreign typologies of political regimes, their correspondence to the realities of Russian regions. The practice of actual gubernatorial control over the arrangement of the main political and economic regional players in Kuzbass does not allow us to speak about the balance of branches of power in the region. The author, in his analysis of the problems of the regional political regime, relies on a neoinstitutional methodology. Studies of regional political regimes presuppose reliance on verifiable methods of analysing socio-economic and political processes in the region that allow us to identify the unique architecture of the regional political regime. At the same time, it is difficult to count on success, basing only on statistical and empirical materials. For success, it is necessary to keep political processes that partially overlap a particular region, take into account national political trends and perspectives that inevitably affect the perception and evaluation of local regional processes. The political order in most of Russia's regions is characterised by the prevalence of policy over economy. Institutional processes here are regulated mainly by informal conventions. In Kuzbass, power and property constitute an indivisible institution. Features of the regional regime in these conditions are: the phenomenon of "power - property"; redistribution type of economy; class model of stratification; orientation to the preservation of socio-political processes, and not to the innovative development of the region. The relationship between power and property is built around the theory of the administrative market with the dominant role of the regional bureaucracy. In Kuzbass, the formation of a free competitive market was not completed, and interest groups form a system of inequalities by the criterion of the opportunities for rental access, determined by the attitude of the first person (the governor). Stratification is of a cast-paternal, closed character, and is a derivative of the degree of possession of imperious resources. The regional political regime assumes the architecture of power on the basis of the "power - property" relationship and the formation of the ruling elite uncontrolled from civil society. Kuzbass business for many years mostly avoided solidarisation, preferring backstage arrangements with the governor of Kuzbass and his clientele. The boundaries and opportunities for regional cliques in the adoption and implementation of political (state) decisions are primarily determined by their links with informal and formal institutions of power; the personal composition of participants in these entities; compliance of resources and objectives of these associations with the regulatory restrictions existing in the state. The results of their activities can be judged by indirect data and, above all, by the results of the distribution of tangible and intangible resources in society, demonstrating the true beneficiaries of regional management. In Kemerovo Oblast, due to the poor quality of institutions, the apathy of the population, the weakness of civil society and the lack of control of the ruling elite, shadow structures (cliques, clientele, clans) currently have a decisive influence in approving regional policy goals and making key management decisions.

AB This paper identifies the intersecting technical and social factors that have fueled a history of conflict between artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) and large-scale mining, and more recently, their potential coexistence, in Marmato, Colombia. At Marmato, a vertically zoned ore body and corresponding vertically stacked land claims have in part fueled tensions between ASM and large-scale mining. These same characteristics have also given rise to a scenario which could facilitate the coexistence of both parties. The case of Marmato has implications for policy and decision-making around relations between ASM and large-scale mining elsewhere, notably: 1) how a politicization of natural hazards can exacerbate existing asymmetries in power, wealth, and risk; 2) some deposit types such as epithermal veins may be particularly suited to coexistence, but site-specific characteristics determine whether the technically feasible mining methods could facilitate or preclude coexistence; 3) how equity is central to successful coexistence; and 4) how approaches such as contract mining will need to integrate social and technical considerations.

AB Introduction: Sleeping sickness or Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease of public health importance across much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, chronic T. b. gambiense HAT (gHAT) and acute T. b. rhodesiense HAT (rHAT) occur in two large but discrete geographical foci. Both forms are difficult to diagnose, expensive to treat and ultimately fatal in the absence of treatment. The area affected by zoonotic rHAT has been steadily expanding, placing a high burden on local health systems. HAT is a disease of neglected populations and is notorious for being under-reported. Here we examine the factors that influence passive rHAT surveillance within the district health system in four Ugandan districts into which the disease had recently been introduced, focusing on staff knowledge, infrastructure and data management.
   Methods: A mixed methods study was undertaken between 2011 and 2013 in Dokolo, Kaberamaido, Soroti and Serere districts to explore health facility capacity and clinical service provision, diagnostic capacity, HAT knowledge and case reporting. Structured interviews were undertaken with 86 medical personnel, including clinicians, nurses, midwives and technicians across 65 HC-II and HC-III medical facilities, where the health infrastructure was also directly observed. Eleven semi-structured interviews were undertaken with medical staff in each of the three designated HAT treatment facilities (Dokolo, Lwala and Serere HC-IV) in the area. HAT treatment centre case records, collected between 2009 and 2012, were analyzed.
   Results: Most medical staff in HC-II and HC-III facilities had been made aware of HAT from radio broadcasts, newspapers and by word of mouth, suggestive of a lack of formal training. Key knowledge as regards the causative agent, clinical signs and that HAT drugs are provided free of charge was lower amongst HC-II than HC-III staff. Many respondents did not know whether HAT was endemic in their district. In rHAT specialist treatment centres, staff were knowledgeable of HAT and were confident in their ability to diagnose and manage cases. Between 2009-2012, 342 people were diagnosed in the area, 54% in the late stage of the disease. Over the period of this study the proportion of rHAT cases identified in early stage fell and by 2012 the majority of cases identified were diagnosed in the late stage.
   Conclusion: This study illustrates the critical role of the district health system in HAT management. The increasing proportion of cases identified at a late stage in this study indicates a major gap in lower tier levels in patient referral, diagnosis and reporting that urgently needs to be addressed. Integrating HAT diagnosis into national primary healthcare programs and providing training to medical workers at all levels is central to the new 2030 WHO HAT elimination goal. Given the zoonotic nature of rHAT, joined up active surveillance in human and animal populations in Uganda is also needed. The role of the Coordinating Office for Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda in implementing a One Health approach will be key to sustainable management of zoonotic HAT. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB The study of policy entrepreneurs as agents of change has developed greatly in recent years, supported by increasingly more sophisticated theoretical and empirical research. In this article, we first consider how the concept of the policy entrepreneur can be integrated into broader theories of the policy process, with particular focus on the compatibility of the concept with the narrative policy framework. We then propose that further empirical research on policy entrepreneurs focus on five tasks: (i) delimiting policy entrepreneurs as a distinct class of actor; (ii) investigating contextual factors that encourage the emergence of policy entrepreneurs; (iii) further specifying the strategies policy entrepreneurs deploy; (iv) improving the measurement of the impact policy entrepreneurs have in the policy process; and (v) identifying when policy entrepreneurs prompt widescale change. New theoretical and empirical contributions along these lines could do much to advance our understanding of agency and structure in contemporary politics.

AB Although policy entrepreneurship is essential for fostering policy innovations to achieve sustainable development, the literature has conflated different types of entrepreneurship and disaggregated it using inconsistent terminology. We conceptualize entrepreneurship using a six-stream variant of the multiple streams framework (MSF)-which addresses key limitations of the original MSF-to examine entrepreneurial activities in the case of the Jyotigram Yojana, a widely recognized policy innovation for managing the energy-water nexus in Gujarat, India. We find that whereas policy and political entrepreneurship no doubt played a significant role in coupling the streams and fostering this policy innovation, the process broker, program champion, and technology innovator were also important in policy formulation, implementation, and "success." We conclude that the six-stream variant of MSF is useful for identifying and distinguishing various types of entrepreneurship involved in policy innovation for sustainability.

AB Although much of the research on learning in the public sector examines collaborative arrangements and interorganizational networks, it often stresses the importance of individual dialogue and social interaction as primary methods of learning. Given the collective focus, the current emphasis on organizational interaction has left the individual mechanisms by which learning occurs unspecified and understudied. This study takes as its unit of analysis the dyadic, advice seeking ties that operate as the pathways by which knowledge is transferred and developed among organizational members. Rather than exploring a single advice or knowledge sharing network, this study offers a novel approach for examining the social dynamics of organizational learning by linking two different types of task-relevant knowledge to the social networks that emerge when employees search for that knowledge. By measuring where expertise resides in each knowledge specific network and by modeling the processes and conditions affecting knowledge transfer, this study is able to analyze how efficiently organizations tap into the resources and skills that already exist among their members. The findings suggest that employees tend to ignore the experts when seeking tacit information, and instead rely on those they feel most comfortable with and with whom are most accessible. Several important distinctions to the patterns of network formation are noted between public and private organizations. Overall, the results suggest that public managers need to pay attention to the costs of knowledge sharing as much as its benefits in order to promote organizational learning.

   conflict; effective remedies; Turkey; Dogan and Others v Turkey
AB The Council of Europe post-enlargement reforms aimed at transforming the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) into a quasi-constitutional court and enhancing its efficiency. This article is concerned with one such reform, 'the pilot judgment mechanism', and contests the desirability of its application to gross and systematic violations. It discusses why, contrary to opposing claims, the ECtHR's judgment in Dogan and Others v Turkey concerning the forced eviction of Kurdish civilians by the military is a pilot judgment. It then shows why this matters based on the Court's decision in Icyer and Others v Turkey, which found a compensation law the Turkish Government adopted in response to Dogan to be an effective domestic remedy, and the Court's consequent rejection of 800-1,500 pending cases. Based on empirical research, the article argues that in applying the pilot judgment to the Kurdish cases, the ECtHR reduced the notion of 'effective remedy' to compensation, overlooking the victims' demands for truth and justice, and enabled Turkey to continue to commit gross violations with impunity. It concludes that, while pilot judgments might be effective in handling repetitive cases arising from systemic legal problems in post-communist contexts, they should not be applied to conflict or post-conflict cases where the underlying problems are deeply rooted ethno-political disputes.

AB The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations aspire to create the world's most ambitious trade agreement between the world's two largest economies. The politics associated with TTIP are different from those associated with previous trade negotiations. Moreover, they diverge from the prevailing International Political Economy (IPE) account of trade policy. The politics of TTIP diverge from the conventional IPE account of trade politics in two particularly noteworthy ways. First, rather than being rivals, American and European business interests are allies, adopting common positions on what they want the agreement to look like. Second, opposition within both the USA and the EU comes not primarily from firms and workers fearing increased economic competition, but from less traditional trade actors - consumer and environmental groups and citizens - concerned about the erosion of valued regulations. I argue that the unusual politics is the product of two distinct, but related factors. The first is the extraordinary level of cross-investment between the two economies. The second concerns the unique emphasis on addressing non-tariff barriers, particularly regulatory differences, and the significance of the negotiating partner. I test the plausibility of these arguments through within-case variation and by preliminary comparison to other contemporary negotiations of deep' preferential trade agreements.
