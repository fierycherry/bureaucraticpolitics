In so doing, scholars have predominantly examined the emergence and transformations of archives during the early modern age, focusing mostly on political and diplomatic depositories. They have tended to neglect financial archives, which is unfortunate, as—alongside judicial archives—they were probably the largest documentary repositories of the pre-modern world and those that first faced the problem of managing huge masses of documentation. This article discusses the formation and development of the Kingdom of Sicily’s financial archives in the later Middle Ages, arguing that this repository evolved into a collecting archive by the early fifteenth-century, when it preserved not only the records and accounts produced by the central financial administration, but also those from a number of territorial officers and magistracies. This archival turn, I suggest, originated from the fact that the Crown of Aragon’s rulers constantly needed increased incomes to fund bureaucracies and warfare and exercise patronage, and thus needed financial information organized, at hand, and under their control. After briefly discussing the emergence of the financial archive in the thirteenth-century, this essay traces the Crown’s attempts to create a stable repository for storing financial records and accounts and its continuous struggles to prevent documentation from being scattered and dispersed. Finally, it examines the successful strategy that King Alfonso V of Aragon (1416–58), called the Magnanimous, pursued to organize financial documentation and concentrate records and accounts produced by financial administration into a stable building. The essay pays particular attention to the material aspects of preserving records, e.g., the restoration of buildings, construction of chests, and preparation of secure locks that were integral to the emergence of collecting archives for financial documents in the later Middle Ages. © 2021, The Author(s).","Concentration; Destruction; Dispersal; Financial and accounting records; Kingdom of Sicily; Material aspects",,,,,,"2018 BP 00274; PGC2018-094502-B-I00; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; European Commission, EC: 801370; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","Rappresentanze di Palermo = RP; Numerazione Provvisoria = NP; Lettere Reali = LR; Lettere Viceregie = LV; Real Cancillería = RC; Andenmatten, B., Castelnuovo, G., Produzione e conservazione documentarie nel principato sabaudo, XIII-XV secolo (2008) Bullettino Dell’istituto Storico Italiano per Il Medio Evo, 110, pp. 279-348; Barberi, G.L., (1962) Beneficia Ecclesiastica, , ed. by I Peri. 2 vols, Manfredi, Palermo; Blair, A.M., Milligan, J., Toward a cultural history of archives (2007) Special Issue of Arch Sci, 7 (4); Brendecke, A., (2015) Praktiken der frühen neuzeit: akteure-handlungen-artefakte, , (ed), Böhlau, Cologne; Brendecke, A., (2016) The Empirical Empire: Spanish Colonial Rule and the Politics of Knowledge, , De Gruyter Oldenbourg, Berlin-Boston 2016; Capasso, B., (2009) Historia diplomatica regni Siciliae ab anno 1250 ad annum 1266, , R Pilone.

Politicians and bureaucrats create pockets or networks of effectiveness that allow some departments to perform more efficiently than others. How do these networks develop and how are politicized bureaucratic appointments used to influence performance? Drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in Punjab, Pakistan, this paper argues that politicians and bureaucrats ensure enhanced performance by making legal and extra-legal appointments of hand-picked bureaucrats to key posts. The choice of bureaucrat is made on the basis of carefully curated relationships of patronage established through work, training, and old school networks. As a result, temporary networks of effectiveness are created but rendered unsustainable by the very patronage relationships that create them, preventing them from evolving into more permanent pockets of effectiveness. More broadly, my argument contributes to debates on intra-state capacity and politicization, establishing a link between patterns of staffing and patterns of governance. © 2021, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).","Bureaucratic performance; Pakistan; Patronage; Pockets of effectiveness; South Asia; State capacity","bureaucracy; fieldwork; governance approach; nation state; qualitative analysis; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]",,,,,,"Abdulaimohan, A.-G.G., (2019) The Politics of Bureaucratic ‘pockets of effectiveness’: Insights from Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, , www.effective-states.org, Pockets of Effectiveness Working Paper No. 3.

Despite its prevalence, this perspective does not account for the services that job recipients frequently provide to their political principals beyond the one-time exchange of political support. Drawing on extensive data from Benin and Ghana, including a comprehensive database of minister biographies, surveys of bureaucrats, administrative data, and elite interviews, this article argues that leaders distribute and manage state jobs in ways that enable them to extract and control state money for political financing. Whether incumbent leaders extract state resources themselves, delegate to elite party agents, or co-opt and coerce bureaucrats to divert money to the party shapes which jobs they distribute politically and to whom. The findings suggest that jobs are substantively different from other currencies of clientelistic exchange. © The Author(s) 2021.","African politics; bureaucracies; corruption and patronage; party finance; presidents and executive politics",,,,,,"Syracuse University, SU","Abdulai, A.-G., Mohan, G., (2019) The politics of bureaucratic ‘pockets of effectivenes’: Insights from Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, , ESID Working Paper, Manchester University; Abegaz, B., Political parties in business: Rent seekers, developmentalists, or both?

Iran's 1979 revolution is no exception. While Pahlavi-era public officials were initially maintained in their posts, bureaucratic structures were ultimately dismantled and civil servants - including diplomats - were ousted. As of November 1979, changing power balances among revolutionary elites triggered profound diplomatic purges. International isolation, exogenous pressures and lasting conflict with Iraq threatened the new regime's durability. The Islamic Republic's new diplomatic apparatus thus needed to articulate three fundamental and interconnected imperatives: diplomats must be loyal, they must be skilled and their social characteristics must echo revolutionary expectations. Pahlavi diplomats were first replaced by young and politicised revolutionary militants, who were promoted through clerical elites' patronage, and often lacked diplomatic expertise. This very shortage of both diplomatic competencies and university credentials, combined with the absence of formalised recruitment processes, eventually challenged long-term regime consolidation. This paper examines how institutional instruments, set up to conduct the recruitment and training of the Islamic Republic's new diplomatic elite, were fashioned into existence and reformed over time. More precisely, it highlights the intricate articulation between, on the one hand, new diplomats' socio-political properties and the nature of their relations to political elites and, on the other hand, distinct sources of regime legitimation oriented towards the Iranian population and foreign diplomats. Relying on archival work, interviews, as well as data and network analyses, this work demonstrates how diplomats' recruitment and training institutions, striking a balance between specific forms of loyalty, expertise and representativeness, ensured stable political-administrative arrangements over time. It further highlights how the Islamic Republic's institutional duality regulates diverging elite agendas and interests, in that it facilitates a division of diplomatic labour between (1) the promotion of diplomatic overture and (2) the sustainment of a '.revolutionary' external agenda. © 2022 Brill Nijhoff.

These governments remain dependent on upper levels for funding which has been found to be influenced by patronage politics and partisan alignment. In this paper, we show that the networks of locally elected officials and bureaucrats determine the allocation of discretionary funds and resources to local governments. Villages whose elected heads reported stronger connections with local bureaucrats were more likely to win a one-time inter-village competition for funds organized by the district administration of Palwal - a district in the North Indian state of Haryana. Locally elected officials in the district also report that bureaucratic connections are at least as necessary as political ties with higher-level politicians to obtain funds for their villages. This centrality of bureaucratic connections can be partly attributed to the institutional design in India. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bureaucracy; Decentralization; development in India; local development; local government",,,,,,,"Afridi, F., Iversen, V., Sharan, M.R., Women Political Leaders, Corruption, and Learning: Evidence from a Large Public Program in India (2017) Economic Development and Cultural Change, 66 (1), pp. 1-30; Agnihotri, A., Chowdhury, A., (2020), Party Alignment and Fiscal Transfers: Evidence From West Bengal, India,.

Scholars have long focused on cabinet appointments to understand how executives build coalitions with their legislative allies. In many democracies, however, cabinet appointments at the ministerial level may only represent the tip of the iceberg. We show that administrative political appointees (APAs) beneath the ministerial level constitute one of the most important ways that cooperation between legislative and executive is forged. Leveraging a unique and comprehensive database of an average 2600 Brazilian APAs per year over two decades, we evaluate their effect on coalition unity in critical legislative votes. We demonstrate that these APAs, which we collectively term the “patronage coalition,” have a significant effect on legislative support and thus are a critical tool for presidents. Our results are particularly relevant to a new emphasis in the political science literature on the “toolbox” that presidents utilize to address the challenges of simultaneously maintaining legislative support while implementing policy. These results demonstrate that the patronage coalition is a fundamental tool that should be more widely integrated into models of legislative-executive bargaining. © The Author(s) 2022.","bureaucracy; coalitional presidentialism; legislative coalition; patronage; political appointments",,,,,,,"Alemán, E., Tsebelis, G., Political Parties and Government Coalitions in the Americas (2011) Journal of Politics in Latin America, 3 (1), pp. 3-28; Almeida, A.D.S., (2018) Governo presidencial condicionado: delegação e participação legislativa na Câmara dos Deputados, , Ph.D. Thesis, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Altman, D., The Politics of Coalition Formation and Survival in Multiparty Presidential Democracies (2000) Party Politics, 6 (3), pp. 259-283. , https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1354068800006003001; Amorim Neto, O., Presidential Cabinets, Electoral Cycles, and Coalition Discipline in Brazil (2002) Legislative Politics in Latin America, pp. 48-78. , Scott Morgenstern, Benito Nacif, (eds), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press,,. edited by, eds, ‐; Amorim Neto, O., Cabinets and Coalitional Presidentialism (2019) Routledge Handbook of Brazilian Politics, pp. 293-312. , Barry Ames, (ed), New York, Routledge,,. edited by, ed, ‐; Anonymous, (2013), High Level Official Presidents Casa Civil Ministry, Author interview, July 30; Batista, M., Who Gets What and How Does It Matter?

The median duration in this type of position is 25 months and, at the top bureaucratic level, 23 months. About 30% of the nominees do not complete their first year of work and less than 30% of them remain in the same position for an entire presidential term. Factors such as the stability of ministers, affiliation to parties, belonging to federal careers, and place of work influence the chances of permanence of the nominees. The results contribute to unraveling the Brazilian Federal Executive’s working logic and its relationship with federative and party organizations. They also contribute to reflecting on ways to expand planning capacities and on the quality of the policy planning cycle by the public authority in charge. © 2022, Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Politicos (IESP), UERJ.

Inner-city residents in Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, have long coped with poor drainage and waste collection that increases flood and health risks. Drawing upon a wide range of sources, this study examines how a system of patronage and partisan politics in Jamaica has helped to (re)produce this infrastructural deficit that has harmful effects on many inner-city residents, from independence in 1962 to the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, the busiest on record. In doing so, it will enhance understanding of the nature of Jamaican politics at the local level, highlighting that politics of the Kingston and St Andrew Corporation (KSAC)—the municipal council—was marked by a continuous interaction between citizens, councilors, MPs, and civil servants, and that short-term jobs and contracts were the most important avenues of patronage © The Author(s) 2022.","corruption; flooding; Jamaica; politics; waste",,,,,,,,,,"SAGE Publications Inc.",,,,,00961442,,,,"English","J.

Low levels of schooling do not prevent people from writing down and submitting their grievances, since model letters circulate in family and neighborly networks. More come from women than from men. Far from simple requests for patronage or expressions of submission, they carry a blend of excuses, prayers, proclamations of rights, threats, intimate accounts, and demands. Rather than focusing on a scene of collective mobilization or encounters with state bureaucracies, the article concerns letters that provide accounts of the poor’s legal consciousness and the current systems of legitimacy for claiming that they deserve. Based on a body of 200 letters addressed to President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner between 2007 and 2015, this article analyses such letters as a genuine form of action that aims to change the relationship between the poor, state agencies, and the law. © The Author(s) 2019.","Argentina; bureaucracy and documents; grievances and petitions; legal consciousness; welfare state; Working-class politics; writing",,,,,,,"Albert-Llorca, M., Le courrier du Ciel (1993) Écritures Ordinaires, pp. 183-222. , Fabre D., (ed), Paris, Centre Georges Pompidou/POL, In:, (ed; Allard, O., Walker, H., Paper, power and procedure: Reflections on Amazonian appropriations of bureaucracy and documents (2016) Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, 21 (3), pp. 402-413; Artières, P., Laé, J.-F., (2011) Écritures Personnelles.

This work addresses how the government can ensure the cost-effective procurement of pediatric vaccines by all U.S. children from private manufacturers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) significant patronage of pediatric vaccines affords them leverage in negotiating public-sector prices that prevent the formation of monopolies, but existing vaccine pricing literature excludes the CDC as a rational player. Academic/practical relevance: We combine optimization and game theoretic techniques to address cost-effective immunization of all U.S. children. Methodology: Our optimization model from the CDC’s perspective minimizes negotiated government costs while ensuring adequate national vaccination levels, linking dynamics in public and private sectors, and incorporating competitive manufacturer behavior. The optimization model embeds an extant game theoretic price model to capture competitive interactions among manufacturers in the private sector, where they compete independently of the CDC. The model is validated in an extended case study of the Infanrix–Daptacel vaccine duopoly. Results: The study indicates that dissimilar products advantageously segment markets with asymmetric manufacturers. Furthermore, markets are at lower risk when high-capacity manufacturers have moderate target profits, especially in cases of high demand and asymmetry. We demonstrate that our model can help restabilize a market that experiences a vaccine shortage and that the CDC might mitigate the same shortage using strategies that depend on which manufacturer is limited. We also underline scenarios in which the CDC may be able to prevent monopolies through financial incentives to manufacturers. The results support a paradigm shift from annual contracts to ongoing negotiations, which would enable the CDC to exercise control over high-risk markets. Managerial implications: Our study demonstrates an analytical approach for managerial government officials to influence pediatric vaccine prices via the procurement of public-sector goods. © 2020 INFORMS","Contracts; Game theory; Healthcare; Optimization; Pediatric vaccine pricing; Public policy; Vaccine shortages","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Disease control; Game theory; Managers; Manufacture; Optimization; Pediatrics; Analytical approach; Centres for disease control and preventions; Cost effective; Game-theoretic; Optimisations; Optimization models; Pediatric vaccine pricing; Public sector; Vaccine markets; Vaccine shortage; Vaccines",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1122374","Behzad, B, Jacobson, S, Asymmetric Bertrand-Edgeworth-Chamberlin competition with linear demand: A pediatric vaccine pricing model (2016) Service Sci, 8 (1), pp. 71-84; Behzad, B, Jacobson, S, Robbins, M, A symmetric capacity-constrained differentiated oligopoly model for the United States pediatric vaccine market with linear demand (2015) IIE Trans, 47 (11), pp. 1252-1266; Bertrand, J, Review of “Théorie mathématique de la richesse sociale” by Leon Walras and “Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses” by Augustin Cournot (1883) J. des Savants, 67, pp. 499-508; Chamberlin, E, (1933) The Theory of Monopolistic Competition, , (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA); Coleman, M, Sangrujee, N, Zhou, F, Chu, S, Factors affecting U.S. manufacturers’ decisions to produce vaccines (2005) Health Affairs, 24 (3), pp. 635-642; Cournot, A, (1838) Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses, , (L.

In this paper we take a first step toward a sociology of social development by defining which indicators other than economic growth best capture different facets of citizen well-being, theorizing what social phenomena explain the variance in these indicators, and specifying causal mechanisms that connect the two. We show quantitatively that one main predictor of social development is basic sanitation, and that a key correlate of poor sanitation is corruption in law enforcement. We use direct measures of experiences with corruption, rather than subjective measures of perceptions of corruption. We then draw on qualitative data to suggest why and how corruption in the judiciary enables poor sanitation. Where the state does not efficiently deliver municipal services, intermediaries facilitate illegal access to services, and can only perform their work if law enforcement can be bribed. But by providing access to some citizens and not all, these intermediaries fragment citizens' interests. Politics develops around lines of patronage rather than programmatic policies, and those who do not have the material resources to bypass the poor municipal systems, or the political resources to participate in patronage, are left without access to basic sanitation. © 2021 by the Regents of the University of California.

A former mayor of Davao City was elected to the presidency and the widow of a former Naga City mayor to the vice presidency. These cases reflect various political dynamics, including bossism, patronage politics, a developmental authoritarian regime, and a grassroots democracy. Beyond typological studies on local politics, this chapter reveals the transforming nature of local politics by scru-tinizing policy making and policy implementation at the local level. Local policy makers become policy entrepreneurs when they find innovative ways to implement existing policies in particular local contexts or when they create new local policies. The policies may take on their own nature, or a built-in nature, via new institutions and changing expectations that outlast the term of political leaders. After reviewing conventional knowledge to understand the transforming nature of local politics, this chapter provides a brief case study of the coalition politics behind the Local Government Code of 1991. Policy coalitions—made up of politicians, bureaucrats, civil society activists, and businesspeople—work to make and implement policies at the national and local levels. ©Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University.","Built-in nature; Decentralization; Local politics; Local transformation; Policy coalition; Policy entrepreneurs; Reform policy; The Philippines","civil society; decentralization; election; grassroots level; local government; policy implementation; policy making; reform process; Philippines",,,,,,"Alampay, Erwin A., Resiliency and Adaptation in Albay Province: Aiming for Zero Causalities (2017) Transforming Local Government, pp. 13-24. , edited by Ma.

The low quality of urban healthcare in many low- and middle-income countries is well documented. But there is relatively little analysis showing how the politics of urban healthcare delivery contribute to quality shortfalls. This study integrates urban and political theory and draws on ethnographic fieldwork in municipal government-run primary care clinics in Pune, India. I conceptualize Pune's municipal doctors as street-level bureaucrats: frontline state agents charged with delivering public services, who regularly confront conflicts between their mandate and its realization in practice. I observe how the municipal doctors experience and respond to these conflicts; delineate the historical design of the municipal institutions in which they operate; and interview doctors, nurses, nonclinical staff, administrators, and elected officials, who collectively shape primary care delivery in municipal clinics. My findings show how the doctors' work is characterized by routine departures from public service ideals. The departures stem from local electoral politics (politicians' patronage and clientelistic relations with municipal employees and patients) and weak administrative capacity (misuse and incompetent planning of public resources). The doctors are compelled to follow extra-policy directives, meaning instructions that have little to do with healthcare goals and that emphasize the political utility rather than medical purpose of their work. In response, the doctors circumscribe their clinical practice. They aim, as one doctor put it, only to “ensure the ordinary,” or to sustain a deficient status quo. In these conditions, improving quality of care requires not just behavioral interventions targeted at doctors. It requires normative, social, and organizational shifts in public service planning and delivery so that doctors are positioned – materially and affectively – to meet urban healthcare challenges in low-resource contexts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bureaucracy; Corruption; India; Political institutions; Politics; Primary care; Urban health","bureaucracy; corruption; institutional framework; political development; primary health care; public service; urban area; administrative personnel; adult; article; clinical practice; doctor nurse relation; employee; field work; government; human; India; interview; middle income country; primary medical care; public figure; public sector; theoretical study; urban health; health care delivery; India; politics; primary health care; India; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; India; Politics; Primary Health Care; Public Sector",,,,,"Social Science Research Council, SSRC; Columbia University","Adams, A., Nambiar, D., Siddiqi, S., Binte Alam, B., Reddy, S., Advancing universal health coverage in South asian cities: a framework (2018) BMJ, 363; Amrith, S., Political culture of health in India: a historical perspective (2007) Economic & Political Weekly, 42 (2), pp. 114-121; Auerbach, A., “Neighborhood associations and the urban poor: India's slum development committees (2017) World Dev., 96, pp. 119-135; Auerbach, A., LeBas, A., Post, A., Weitz-Shapiro, R., State, society, and informality in cities of the global South (2018) Stud.

We develop a dynamic model of personnel policy, bureaucratic quality, and electoral competition. In each period, incumbents choose how much to support patronage and civil service personnel systems. The civil service system is needed to produce public goods, but patronage provides private goods and improves an incumbent’s reelection prospects. Incumbents must also worry about whether opponents will sustain the civil service system following an electoral loss. Our results demonstrate the importance of a cross-party commitment to public goods, along with low costs of civil service hiring, for encouraging good government in equilibrium. The model also suggests that electoral competitiveness has only a limited influence on good government and challenges previous arguments about electoral vulnerability and civil service reform. We finally present empirical evidence regarding our predicted relationship between party system convergence and merit-based hiring. © 2021 by the Southern Political Science Association.

Contrary to similar studies conducted in other high-corruption contexts, such as India, we find evidence that students who prefer a public sector career display less willingness to cheat or bribe in experimental games as well as higher levels of altruism. However, disaggregating public sector career paths reveals distinctions between the federal civil service and other types of public sector employment, with federal government positions attracting students who exhibit some similarities with their peers aspiring to private sector careers. We discuss multiple interpretations consistent with our findings, each of which has implications for the creation of effective anti-corruption policies and for understanding of state capacity in contexts where corruption is widespread. © The Author(s) 2020.","bureaucracies; corruption and patronage; political economy; public administration; Russia",,,,,,"Northwestern University, NU; National Research University Higher School of Economics, ВШЭ","Abbink, K., Hennig-Schmidt, H., Neutral versus loaded instructions in a bribery experiment (2006) Experimental Economics, 9 (2), pp. 103-121; Abbink, K., Irlenbusch, B., Renner, E., An experimental bribery game (2002) Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 18 (2), pp. 428-454; Alatas, V., Cameron, L., Chaudhuri, A., Erkal, N., Gangadharan, L., Subject pool effects in a corruption experiment: A comparison of Indonesian public servants and Indonesian students (2009) Experimental Economics, 12 (1), pp. 113-132; Banerjee, R., Baul, T., Rosenblat, T., On self selection of the corrupt into the public sector (2015) Economics Letters, 127, pp. 43-46; Banuri, S., Keefer, P., Pro-social motivation, effort and the call to public service (2016) European Economic Review, 83, pp. 139-164; Barfort, S., Harmon, N., Hjorth, F., Olsen, A.L., Sustaining honesty in public service: The role of selection (2019) American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 11 (4), pp. 96-123; Barfort, S., Harmon, N., Olsen, A., Hjorth, F., (2015) A formal model of corruption, dishonesty and selection into public service, , https://static-curis.ku.dk/portal/files/144009137/CorruptionDishonestyCorruption_theory.pdf, University of Copenhagen, Department of Economics, (Working Paper; Barr, A., Serra, D., The effects of externalities and framing on bribery in a petty corruption experiment (2009) Experimental Economics, 12 (4), pp. 488-503; Barr, A., Serra, D., Corruption and culture: An experimental analysis (2010) Journal of Public Economics, 94 (11), pp. 862-869; Benz, M., Meier, S., Do people behave in experiments as in the field?

However, patronage is understudied in cases when a change of minister takes place without government termination. Taking individual government ministers as the units of analysis, we identify four modalities of ministerial alterations: replacing, successive, incumbent, and switching ministers. We show that politicization occurs under “replacing ministers” following government termination, but the bureaucratic turnover is equally high under “successive ministers.” That suggests that patronage can be seen as an individualized power resource of autonomous ministers who exercise influence independently of their political parties. © The Author(s) 2020.","ministerial alterations; patronage; political appointments; political parties; top executives",,,,,,"Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR: GA 18-15700S; Vedecká Grantová Agentúra MŠVVaŠ SR a SAV, VEGA: 1/0628/19","Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and politicians in Western democracies, , Harvard University Press; Bach, T., Hammerschmid, G., Löffler, L., More delegation, more political control?

Bureaucrats are thought to “actively” represent their communities by trying to make them better off. This article proposes an alternative understanding of individual behavior in representation that emphasizes knowledge sharing instead of patronage, but leads to similar outcomes: Their societal background provides officials with advanced social knowledge about the group(s) they represent, including both informational knowledge (facts about culture, history, politics) and relational knowledge (how people interact). Bureaucratic knowledge linkage is the process of sharing information and managing relations internally and with citizens. An extreme case serves to illustrate knowledge linkage empirically: Survey data from an international organization yield high levels of knowledge asymmetries within staff bodies and subsequent observation of knowledge linkage mechanisms. In generalizing findings, the risks (knowledge distortions) and benefits (attaining public value) of knowledge linkage are discussed for both international and domestic administrations. © 2020 The Author.

This was a period when security was re-established in most of the country, government bureaucracy reformed and basic public services re-instated (at least, in urban areas). Out of the three priorities, the NRM government succeeded most in re-establishing security and in particular securing the monopoly of state on violence. However, Uganda’s reality demonstrates two conflicting narratives about the government’s performance over the past 30 years: “Uganda as a success” and “Uganda in crisis”. The continued tension between the state bureaucracy, supposedly apolitical and meritocratic, and the patronage-based political establishment gnaws at public sector efficiency. In the absence of strong national commitment and a clear strategic direction, the public sector reform agenda is likely to continue to be driven by donors, lack coherence and deliver mixed results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,"Amundsen, I., (2006) Political Corruption and the Role of Donors, , in Uganda).

Almost every political issue brought up in public was immediately after transformed into one of national concern. Today’s Roman Catholic Croatian Priest College in Rome whose beneficiaries stemmed entirely from among Habsburg citizens was no exception. When in 1901 this formerly Illyrian institution was to be transformed into an ethnic Croatian, this met not only with Austrian and Hungarian state interest and critic, but was also commented in the press Monarchy-wide even when the reformation plans were not exactly known. Unlike some other scholarly works, this chapter highlights the perspective of Habsburg state bureaucrats who challenged the papal reformation plans, as they feared that the new college would support Croatian nationalism within an institution which was under the patronage of Franz Joseph, and financially supported by Austrian ministries. Finally, this chapter shows how carefully state institutions had to manoeuvre through an issue which for a while seemed to affect the Habsburg relationship with the Holy See. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Catholic church; Croatia; Dalmatia; Habsburgs; Hungary; Journalism; Priest College",,,,,,,"Agramer Zeitung. 1901a Aufhebung Des St. Hieronymus-Capitels.; 1901B.

Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation","Studying informal aspects of politics in Russia and post-Soviet states more broadly has become an influential research trend. The concepts of clientelism and informal networks often serve as a theoretical framework for such an analysis. Despite obvious connotations, students of informal networks only rarely take advantage of methodological tools provided by Social Network Analysis (SNA). They not only allow scholars to visualize a network and to calculate its basic statistic characteristics, but also puts forth more rigorous requirements for the operationalization of the informal network, thereby making it a logically conceptualized category and not just a metaphor, as it is often presented in the literature. By using SNA tools, the presented paper studies informal networks of administrative elites of the Sverdlovsk Oblast. Having experienced a relatively rapid economy recovery following the collapse of the USSR, the region’s success in bargaining with federal elites over the advancement of its legal status in the 1990s and long-term into the office of its first governor brought forth explanations that emphasize the power of elite networks in this region. This article aims to test these assumptions quantitatively. To that end, we analyzed informal networks of the heads of the executive agencies and provided three temporal snapshots. These correspond to the terms of the two governors that held the office: Eduard Rossel and Alexandr Misharin. The informal networks were based on biographical data, which we collected and recorded into the database. This database consists of 665 rows, which contain information on the career paths of 78 officials. After identifying the intersections of the career paths of these individuals prior to them occupying elite positions, we built networks based on them. We have analyzed the structures of these networks, their density, the presence of communities, and centrality measures, which allowed us to see how different the patterns of the networks can be depending on the strategies of their leaders. © 2021","clientelism; Informal networks; network analysis; patron-client relationships; patronage bureaucracy; political regime; regional elites; SNA",,,,,,,"Carter, T., (2015) Networks and Regional Leadership in El’tsin’s Russia: The Case of Eduard Rossel’ in Sverdlovsk Oblast, 1989-1999, , PhD Thesis.

I argue that in the 1860s at least one prominent writer unsuccessfully attempted to establish the relations of mutually profitable cooperation with political power, namely with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Aleksey Pisemsky and the censorship department unsuccessfully tried to organize their relations according to the archaic model of literary patronage. The research is based on both archival and published sources. From Pisemsky's point of view, patronage could become a viable alternative to increasingly radical views of the majority of influential critics and editorial officers. In 1862 his own satirical feuilletons depicting widespread corruption in Russian society were met with harsh criticism that soon transformed into a public scandal and nearly resulted in a duel. Dissatisfied with the modern public sphere centered around mostly radical periodicals, Pisemsky tried to find an alternative institution that would allow literature to free itself from the control of the “nihilistic” editorial officers and reduce the degree of confrontation with the government. In his novel The Troubled Seas (1863), Pisemsky developed the views of the high-ranked liberal bureaucrat Pyotr Valuev on the era of the “great reforms” expressed in his unpublished but widely known paper “The Thought of a Russian”. At the same time, Pisemsky attempted to both influence even the emperor himself and help the “nihilists” to avoid criminal punishment: his novel was supposed to let Alexander II understand that there was no real threat of revolution in Russia, so the people charged could be forgiven. When the novel was ready for publication, Valuev, then the minister of internal affairs, became the head of censorship and agreed to support Pisemsky. Valuev ordered the censors to violate the official rules regarding periodicals and allow the publication with no changes. The minister attempted to support and control loyal journalism, including the influential nationalistic journal Russkiy Vestnik, in which the novel was published. Probably, Valuev also praised the negative portrayal of both radical “nihilists” and blind conservatism in the novel. Pisemsky's attempts eventually failed: by the end of the 1860s, Valuev, who already knew about real revolutionary activities, did not trust Russian writers anymore and hated his former ally Mikhail Katkov, while Pisemsky refused to submit to any editors, including Katkov. The institution of patronage was too archaic for Russian literature of the 1860s, which doomed the cooperation between Pisemsky and Valuev from its very beginning. © 2021 Tomsk State University.

However, when considered collectively in terms of both divan and âşık (minstrelsy) tradition, the attention of the palace can be reached by some numbered names. On the other hand, it is observed that poets/ writers living outside of Istanbul-far from the great cultural centers of the empire and producing in the Ottoman provinces-are protected by prince sanjaks, beylerbeyi centers, governor pashas, vizier who were expelled from Istanbul for various reasons, the frontier chiefs in charge of protecting the borders or relatively small civil servants such as the fiduciary and accountant who are well-off. In this study, how and by whom the names belonging to the tradition of minstrelsy are protected both in the palace and in the provinces will be shown, and the literary circles of art activities spread from the center to the province will be evaluated. In the study, it is stated that the Ottoman Palace was an important patronage center for the minstrels who produced both poetry and music performances; the protection for the âşıks is sometimes shaped by high-level bureaucrats working at the sultan's level and sometimes at the palace; it is revealed that there are short-term forms such as performing a work, as well as long-term examples such as performing certain duties in the palace. From the 15th century onwards, it is seen that among the storytellers (kıssahans) and meddahs who were frequently encountered, primarily in big cities, and who performed their arts in mansions and palaces, well-educated people with a high level of intellect worked as musahib and nedims (mentors) and had an important place in the palace. The artists in question had prestigious positions in the palace from the period of Yıldırım Bayezid until the last period of the Ottoman Empire. In addition to their duties as nedim / musahip, the number of âşıks who perform short or long-term performances in the palace and who are asked to continue this profession in the palace environment are also high. It is understood that among the âşıks who performed in the cafes of the minstrels, most of whom were in Istanbul, they were assigned to the palace and received attention, as in the example of being in the saz committee. Sometimes, it is acknowledged that, with their patronage positions in the Ottoman Empire, state officials supported the names they held in their neighborhoods to write satire and criticism or directed them to produce such content. In the study, it is seen that the local governor representing the provinces besides the Ottoman palace and the administrators of their neigh-borhoods, such as the village aghas, served as patrons for artists in similar positions. At the end of the study, it is seen that the Ottoman tradition created environments that could be addressed to all kinds of literary production in every period; it is understood that administrators from all segments of society, who are interested in art, support artistic production at all levels, from the sultan to government officials, local gentlemen, village lords and bandits. © 2021, Milli Folklor Dergisi.

Yet, since governance lies at the nexus of politics and administration, reforms limited to the administrative dimension are likely to fall short without concomitant political change. This essay argues that in contemporary Latin America, certain political-institutional arrangements or institutional traits are more likely to produce (in)effective governance than others. Specifically, Latin American presidentialism creates several “perils” for governance, including: the rigidity and short time horizons of presidentialism; multipartyism under presidentialism; weakly institutionalized party systems and non-programmatic parties; an imbalance of power between strong presidents and weak legislatures; the plebiscitarian nature of presidentialism; and democratic backsliding and the centralization of power in the presidency. These institutional traits incentivize patronage, promote myopic policymaking, and weaken bureaucratic autonomy. To illustrate how they manifest themselves in public policy, the paper uses evidence from the region’s responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, then concludes by suggesting political reforms that may help to improve governance in the region. © 2021, Seoul National University - Graduate School of Public Administration.

Illuminated and illustrated copies of the work were produced between the 14th and 16th centuries; however, no copies with a complete text, illumination, illustrations, and binding have survived from the time it was written. Three incomplete and repaired copies (where several pages are missing), one in Arabic and two in Persian, with illumination and illustrations (although some of them were made later) were prepared during the Ilkhanid period. The two Persian copies of Jami al-Tavarikh are in the Topkapi Palace Library (H.1653 and H.1654). In their 1996 article, the authors the chapter headings were left without illumination. Subsequently, the book suffered under adverse conditions, as a number of pages were lost, and the original illumination, or binding, was obliterated. Presumably, H.1654 arrived in the Fars region together with H.1653. In the early 15th century, inexpert artists probably in Shiraz painted pictures in a number of empty spaces left for illustrations. However, in around 1425, the rest of the illustrations were added after the book was taken to Herat, and artists probably painted the pictures according to the original sketches drawn in the empty spaces. The illumination of the frontispiece and headings at the beginning of the chapters of H.1654 and all the illuminations in H.1653, apart from fols 1a and 1b, were executed in the Safavid lands presumably in 1590, when wide thick pieces of pinkish paper were added around the edges of the pages of text in both manuscripts. The fact that H.1654 bears a dedication to Farhad Khan Karamanli, a Safavid bureaucrat and bibliophile, suggests that the repairs in the Safavid period may have been performed under the patronage of Farhad Khan. The waqf seal of the Shaykh Safî shrine in Ardabil, bearing the date 1608, was stamped on several pages of H.1654, which indicates that the manuscript was in Ardabil in the early 17th century. By the early 18th century, H.1653 and H.1654, either together or separately, entered the Topkapi Palace manuscript treasury in Istanbul. During the last quarter of the 19th century, the books were taken from the Topkapi Palace manuscript treasury, rebound in the Yildiz Palace bindery, and placed in the Yildiz Palace Library established by Sultan Abdülhamid II. At a certain point from 1909 onwards, when the contents of Yildiz Palace were evacuated, H.1653 and H.1654 were returned to the Topkapi Palace with several books that had originally belonged there. In 1970, to conserve the folios of H.1653, the manuscript was separated into four volumes. The first volume's binding was made at Yildiz Palace bindery, and the other three volumes bore undecorated leather bindings. © 2021. Scientific Culture.

Starting with the appointment of Köprülü Mehmed Pasha as a grand vizier in 1656, the members of the Köprülü household occupied in the years that followed the most important positions in the Ottoman administrative and military system. Thanks to their long-lasting incumbency, the Köprülü grand viziers managed to establish the most efficient political network in the Ottoman state during the seventeenth century. By exploring the roles of the kethüdas, ağas and scribes in the Köprülü household and by examining those of its clients and family members in the military and administrative system, this article sheds light on the transformation of the recruitment system and patronage patterns in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth century. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2021","Household; Köprülü family; Mehmed IV; Ottoman Empire; Patronage; Vizier",,,,,,,"Kunt, M., Royal and other households (2012) The Ottoman World, pp. 103-116. , Christine Woodhead (ed.)

The study presents an overview of the bureaucracy, reviews its evolution, its reforms and transformations as well as engages the salient issues that dominate the discourses on the bureaucracy. Relying on secondary sources of data such as textbooks, journals, official documents, reports, and a discourse analysis, this chapter argues that impartiality, anonymity, and political neutrality are hallmark of bureaucracy, which allows it to function effectively without being encumbered by the vicissitudes of the kaleidoscopic political environment. The finding was that the Nigerian bureaucratic establishment exerts tremendous strain on public overhead expenditure to the detriment of investment in capital project and infrastructure. Rather than draw down the size of the bureaucracy, successive administrations have continued to grow the service as a result of desire to grant political patronage to supporters and acolytes. Considering the endemic corruption that permeates civil service and the entrenched culture of nepotism, this chapter proposes that Nigerian bureaucratic establishment requires much deeper restructuring and a change of mentality and attitude to work than the periodic peripheral reforms seem to offer. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Bureaucracy; Hallmark; Kaleidoscopic; Policy; Politics; Reforms",,,,,,,"Adamolekun, L., (1986) Politics and Administration in Nigeria.

The city governance regimes are distinguished in the way that power is structured, the balance between formal and informal institutions, the nature of the rents allocated, and their developmental and spatial outcomes. Cape Town’s growth-oriented model, founded on intimate relationships between developers and the political elite, exercised centralized control over land rights, which were allocated to entrenched property interests. The weaker clientelist regime in Nelson Mandela Bay relied on a diminishing pool of procurement rents to sustain a decentralized patronage-based system. The paper uses a political settlements framework to understand how the configuration of power in each city is sustained by a particular distribution of rents, mobilized through informal institutions, which in turn impact the structuring of the bureaucracy. The spatial and developmental impacts of the case studies indicate that despite the better development outcomes of Cape Town, neither regime specifically advantages the urban poor. The paper concludes by suggesting ways in which political settlements theory can better account for bureaucratic autonomy and impacts on the space economy. © 2020 Regional Studies Association.","clientelism; holding power; informal institutions; local government; P48; political settlements; R58; rent-seeking; rents; space-economy; spatial planning; urban governance",,,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., García-Jimeno, C., Robinson, J.A., State capacity and economic development: A network approach (2015) The American Economic Review, 105 (8), pp. 2364-2409. , https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20140044; Consolidated general report on the local government outcomes: MFMA 2016/17 (2018) Audit report.

I distinguish between low-and high-skilled positions and argue that the former are valuable for sustaining party machines, while manipulating the latter can undermine state performance. Accordingly, politicians will interfere to ensure their copartisans are hired to low-skilled jobs but select bureaucrats for high-skilled positions based on meritocratic criteria. I test my argument using novel bureaucrat-level data from Ghana (n p 17; 942) and leverage a change in the governing party to investigate hiring patterns. The results suggest that partisan bias is confined to low-ranked jobs. The findings shed light on the mixed effects of electoral competition on patronage identified in prior studies: competition may dissuade politicians from interfering in recruitment to high-ranked positions but encourage them to hire partisans for lowranked positions. © 2020 by the Southern Political Science Association.

To date, however, differences across administrative traditions have received little empirical scrutiny; research tends to be more comparable than comparative. Using data from an expert survey systematically measuring the merit-, political-, and personal-recruitment of senior public servants in 20 countries, this article examines differences across and within the Nordic, Westminster, Germanic and Napoleonic administrative traditions, in addition to the alternative Anglo-American and Southern European traditions. Various tests show meaningful variation in politicization across administrative traditions, with the starkest differences found between the Nordic and Napoleonic traditions.

Are these programs also teaching public financial management to ensure accountability, results, and responsiveness for our future government officials? Are we creating more integrative and ethical public financial managers with the appropriate knowledge of public financial systems? In order to address these questions, this study compiled general and curricular information of 68 masters’s programs in public administration across the 32 states in Mexico, covering a total of 1,138 courses. To conduct the analysis, this article identifies five complementary lenses for evaluating and teaching public finance and budgeting. The authors argue that, although nearly all Masters in Public Policy and Public Administration programs in Mexico teach public finance, there is a wide variation in the lenses, tools, and techniques used across these programs. Furthermore, the scope of this curricular component is not sufficient to face the challenges of the country and its regions, nor to address the diverse social needs, local contexts, and government institutions, and labor market for public employees. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","corporatism; corruption; higher education curriculum; Public finance and budgeting; teaching public administration; transparency",,,,,,,"Addams, J., Ethical survivals in (1898) International Journal of Ethics 8, , 3), Municipal Corruption., 273–291; Aguilar Villanueva, L., (2006) Gobernanza y gestión pública, , México: Fondo de Cultura Económica; Aguilar Villanueva, L., Aporte de las Políticas Públicas y la Nueva Gestión Pública a la Gobernanza (2007) CLAD Reforma Y Democracia, (39); Aguilar Villanueva, L.F., (1995) El estudio de las políticas públicas, , Mexico City: Porrua; Alt, J.E., Chrystal, K.A., (1983) Political economics, , University of California Press; Amieva Huerta, J., (2014) Finanzas Públicas en México, , 2a, México: Porrúa, ed; Arrow, K.J., (1951) Social choice and individual values.

A potential approach to these human security crises is transdisciplinarity, which rests on an integration of knowledge from academic and non-academic stakeholders. However, scholars who have situated their transdisciplinary studies in the Global South have identified linkages between local particularities, especially hierarchical ones, and impediments to knowledge coproduction: the stakeholders on the higher end of a hierarchy restrain the knowledge contributions of those on the lower end. I further these scholars’ research findings by arguing that hierarchies impede knowledge coproduction insofar as its democratic, equal spaces stemming from transdisciplinarity might empower lower-end stakeholders (project-affected villagers) and disempower higher-end stakeholders (government officials), thus prompting the latter–in a bid to re-attain their authority–to counteract transdisciplinarity’s potential reconfiguration of power dynamics. Thus, transdisciplinary interactions between stakeholders can give rise to knowledge contestation. I deepen this central argument by focusing on the counteractions of higher-end stakeholders in my own recent (and ongoing) two-year transdisciplinary project examining the controversial case of Sesan Riverine communities’ livelihood difficulties in Cambodia’s Stung Treng Province. While reflecting on my role in this two-year project, I have found that a nexus exists between the counteractions of government stakeholders and the patronage governance system of the Hun Sen regime. © 2020 Ewha Womans University Graduate School of International Studies.

However, if performance pay is awarded based on loyalty rather than performance, its use may aggravate corruption rather than reduce it. Collusion is facilitated when patronage crowds out merit in the public sector recruitment process, and this study, therefore, tests whether the relationship between performance pay and corruption is conditioned by patronage-based recruitment. A model of corruption is estimated using data from an expert survey of performance pay usage in government in over 100 countries and both a survey-based measure of patronage and a multi-source patronage risk index. A series of cross-country regressions suggest that the effect of performance pay on corruption is negative when patronage is low but either non-significant or positive in countries where patronage pervades the recruitment process. This study demonstrates how a popular anti-corruption reform may interact with competing incentives embedded in the context of implementation to worsen corruption. © 2020","Compensation; Corruption; Patronage; Performance pay; Public sector reform",,,,,,"Incheon National University, INU","An, W., Kweon, Y., Do higher government wages induce less corruption?

Using a regression discontinuity design, we compare the employment outcomes of individuals connected to the winner vis-à-vis those connected to the runner-up in close mayoral races in Ecuador. Among candidates to local councils who lose their bid, the probability of getting a job in the municipality increases tenfold when their own party's mayoral nominee is elected. The effect is very strong for low-ranking positions, which suggests that it is the result of political patronage. Three additional results shed light on where patronage is more likely to emerge. First, the effect is stronger in poorer municipalities, where public sector jobs are more valuable. Second, benefits go largely to politicians better positioned within the party structure. Third, the effect is concentrated among younger mayors, who have a longer career ahead of them to capitalize clientelist arrangements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bureaucracy; Close elections; Patronage; Public sector employment",,,,,,,"Akhtari, M., Moreira, D., Trucco, L., Political Turnover, Bureaucratic Turnover, and the Quality of Public Services (2017), (Tech. rep.); Artiles, M., León-Ciliotta, G., Kleine-Rueschkamp, L., Accountability, Political Capture and Selection Into Politics: Evidence From Peruvian Municipalities (2018), Working Papers 1041 Barcelona Graduate School of Economics; Barbosa, K., Ferreira, F.V., Occupy Government: Democracy and the Dynamics of Personnel Decisions and Public Finances (2019), NBER Working Papers 25501 National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc; Besley, T., Case, A., Does electoral accountability affect economic policy choices?

However, attempts to involve end users in decision making are often met with considerable resistance not just from political elites, but from the bureaucracy. I investigate how and why bureaucrats resist such reforms by focusing on the implementation of the Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authorities Act (1997) in Pakistan, an Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) program that attempted to put farmers in charge of water allocation, revenue collection, and dispute resolution. Drawing on qualitative interviews conducted in 2015 and 2019 with bureaucrats across the administrative hierarchy and water sector practitioners and consultants, I emphasise the role bureaucratic perceptions and incentives played in driving this program into the ground over two decades. My argument is two-pronged. First, I show that bureaucratic resistance to participatory programs needs to be studied in light of wider political events and processes, particularly patterns of political engagement and parallel attempts at devolving power. Second, I find that the precarious conditions under which irrigation bureaucrats work make them unwilling to cede what official power and influence they do have to farmers. In other words, I contend that bureaucratic resistance to farmers’ involvement in decision-making is the result of a more nuanced set of political and bureaucratic experiences than the perceived technical superiority and colonial inheritance of the irrigation bureaucracy. More broadly, my argument has implications for participatory reforms in other sectors and for decentralized government in Pakistan and in other countries in the Global South. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asia; Bureaucratic politics; Irrigation; Pakistan; Patronage; Water","bureaucracy; decision making; elite politics; irrigation system; perception; policy implementation; reform process; Pakistan",,,,,,"Aijaz, A., Akhter, M., From building dams to fetching water: Scales of politicization in the Indus Basin (2020) Water, 12, p. 1351; Akhtar, A.S., (2008), The Politics of Common Sense: State, Society, and Culture in Pakistan.

Relying on detailed matched employer- employee data on the universe of public employees in Brazil over 1997-2014, and on a regression discontinuity design in close electoral races, we establish three main findings. First, political connections are a key and quantitatively large determinant of employment in public organizations, for both bureaucrats and frontline providers. Second, patronage is an important mechanism behind this result. Third, political considerations lead to the selection of less competent individuals. © 2020 American Economic Association.

Drawing on 40 in-depth interviews and 98 days of participant observation, it first investigates the significance of extravagant position-related consumption in building personalized bureaucratic ties (patronage networks) and mobilizing resources for local economic development. It then examines the causal link between President Xi's campaign against corruption and extravagance and the rise of bureaucratic slack in local governments. The anti-extravagance campaign reduces the level of corruption in local government but it discourages local officials, who are motivated primarily by the desire to avoid risk and ensure political survival, from using banquets and gift-giving to build patronage networks, attract investment and mobilize development resources. The article concludes that corruption may contribute positively to the efficiency of a fragmented Chinese bureaucracy in fostering development at the local level, while the anti-corruption campaign compels local cadres to develop a new coping strategy - bureaucratic slack - for implementing policies and developing local economies.

We take documents and paperwork – such as ration cards and community certificates – as a ‘lens’ through which to explore how paper materiality is infused with the politics of power, patronage, and identity. The article brings ethnography from rural Tamil Nadu, South India, in conversation with two bodies of literature: one on the materiality of bureaucracy and one on the nature of political mediation in contemporary India. We demonstrate how everyday engagements with paperwork as well as processes of applying, form filling, and securing recommendations are constitutive of social and political relationships and, ultimately, of citizenship itself. Political mediation around paperwork and bureaucracy generates a hierarchy of citizens rather than equal citizenship for all, yet ordinary villagers transpire as anything but passive. Drawing on patronage networks, engaging in affective performances, and navigating a politics of identity, they actively negotiate access to the state in an attempt to claim their rights as citizens. © 2020 The Authors.

It sets out to present a particular method of research that, borrowing from the discipline of anthropology, takes planning documents as a point of departure. I will inquire into the ways state-initiated architectural projects intersect with the demands and realities of domesticity and residents’ everyday habits of living, giving particular attention to the gender roles and class identities in welfare housing projects and the position of female beneficiaries in relation to their family as well as the larger society. Using the example of the Mehr project in Iran, I demonstrate how housing operated for government officials as a means for re-organizing society along the axes of patronage and patriarchy. Moving to the field of everyday life, however, and building on the discourses of domesticity and women’s struggle, I unpack how, starting from the intimate scale of the domestic, welfare can serve as the basis for a newly empowered beneficiary to conceive her rights and exercise them. The research that is presented in this paper challenges the negative conception of welfare housing as mere charitable aid devoid of any potential for supporting the social rights of a people. © 2020 Intellect Ltd DiT Papers.

We explore institutional pathways away from clientelism by systematically explicating clientelistic propensities with programmatic citizen-oriented ones in undivided Andhra Pradesh. This paper engages with a paradigm shift in policy from clientelistic to programmatic service delivery in rural development by exploring three major rural welfare programmes in undivided Andhra Pradesh: need-based redistribution, evolution of self-help groups and implementation of the right to work in India through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme. We argue that the capacity of the state to deliver owes a great deal to bureaucratic puzzling and political powering over developmental ideas.

Drawing on evidence from Lamu County, and focusing on the planned Lamu Port and South Sudan Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) corridor, this article contends that such high-modernist and ‘new frontier’ discourses are usually complicated by the realities on the ground. Based on common perceptions about land and ethnicity, and how these are intertwined with the politics of belonging and redistribution, these realities exemplify complex economies of anticipation–through which networks of patronage, alliance, and mobilization are being created or entrenched in advance of major investments. This article argues that it is these anticipations–more than official designs–that will determine the future direction of LAPSSET, especially in respect to who will get what, when and how, within its promised prosperous future. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Much of the resource curse literature argues that political leaders spend natural resource revenue in ways that entrench their political power but undermine longer-term economic development. This literature has largely overlooked the role of bureaucrats – those responsible for the day-to-day operations of the state. Bureaucrats may support or constrain political spending in ways that minimize the resource curse. Using results of a survey experiment with over 3000 government employees in Ghana and Uganda, two countries with recent oil and gas discoveries, we find that bureaucrats treated with information on oil revenue are more likely to disapprove of spending practices that benefit political supporters. The results also suggest that material motivations may be at play: bureaucrats in Uganda who are secure in their jobs and outside of government patronage networks are most likely to oppose the political use of oil revenue. These findings challenge unitary state assumptions underlying much of the resource curse literature, especially for new oil producers. They also suggest that policymakers ought to engage civil servants in efforts to avoid or curtail the resource curse. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"bureaucracy; economic development; literature review; oil supply; policy making; political economy; political power; public spending; resource allocation; resource management; state role; Ghana; Uganda",,,,,":539034; Department for International Development, UK Government, DFID; Department for International Development, DFID","Anderson, L., The state in the middle east and North Africa (1987) Comparative Politics, 20 (1), pp. 1-18; Atkinson, G., Hamilton, K., Savings, growth and the resource curse hypothesis (2003) World Development, 31 (11), pp. 1793-1807; Auty, R.M., Industrial Policy Reform in Six Large Newly Industrializing Countries: The resource curse thesis (1994) World Development, 22 (1), pp. 11-26; Badeeb, R., Lean, H.H., Clark, J., The evolution of the natural resource curse thesis: A critical literature survey (2017) Resources Policy, 51 (100), pp. 123-134; Blair, G., Imai, K., Statistical Analysis of List Experiments (2012) Political Analysis, 20, pp. 47-77; (2016), Brierley, Sarah.

The study sheds light on a particular area of party patronage, namely political appointments concerning legislators; it analyzes the factors which could determine whether a member of Parliament will be appointed to a state-owned enterprise’s board of directors after a legislature, seeking to gain a better understanding of how political actors exploit this opportunity. Direct political connections can be conceptualized as instruments to control and reward politicians and/or strategies to enhance political control over the bureaucracy. The empirical investigation suggests that legislators’ efforts in Parliament play a role in the likelihood of patronage appointments. Education does not seem to significantly increase the probability of receiving a nomination for a seat on public firms’ boards, moreover our result casts doubt on the merits or competencies of the appointed politicians. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Appointments of politicians; Patronage; Public firms",,,,,,,"Baturo, A., Mikhaylov, S., Blair disease?

Weber does not approach his theme in the traditional way: as a question of Political Philosophy, of democratic representation or in the context of a contract-theory of political rule. Rather, he interprets democracy against the background of his theory of modernization and rationalization, emphasizing the contribution of the modern state bureaucracy to the regularity, predictability, and legality of power. In this perspective, democratic politics is reduced to potentially irrational charismatic leadership and the regression in the rationalization of state administration by party machines with their patronage and prey politics. Such a perspective proved disastrous in the debates over Weimar’s constitution, in which Weber played an important rule. © 2020 Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH und Co.

In-depth case study analysis helps in tailoring future reforms and enriches academic literature on countries faced with the complex and intertwined problems of fragility, traditional actors, state building and donor involvement. This paper aims at examining the legacies of state-building and civil service reforms in Yemen by providing a narrative of motivations, outcomes as well as the involved politics and actors. Yemen’s state institutions have evolved from times of colonization and isolation to pass through centralization in the two-state era, reunification, decentralization and reorientation towards merit-based bureaucracy. Yemen’s reform experiences did not result in well-performing administrative and civil service institutions while they were often ad hoc, rushed or born out of political circumstances and donors’ pressure. Alongside the devastating civil war, contemporary state-building challenges result from legacies of reform failures. Current problems are exacerbated by long-standing policies of patronage, but they are also a reflection of the difficult reality of dominance of tribal elites, lack of capacities, interference from regional powers, and disagreements about the future shape of the Yemeni state. © 2020 The Author(s).

The research is based on the patronizing letters of the Viceroy to the Director of the Caucasian Committee Vladimir Butkov, as well as on the correspondence between Michael Vorontsov and employees and supporters. Michael Vorontsov's fraction consisted of representatives from various social groups: military, officials, local nobility, religious leaders, merchant circles. This diversity is explained both by the peculiarities of the personality of the Caucasian Viceroy, who combined the qualities of a nobleman, an army leader, a manager, and the socio-political conditions of the region which was led by Michael Vorontsov. The Caucasian Viceroy managed to form a reliable patronage network, which excluded the opposition and was the basis of the regional autocracy of the Viceroy. The administrative apparatus was made up of experienced officials who served with Vorontsov in the Novorossiysk region. Among the local population who supported the Viceroy was the Georgian princely clans, including the Orbeliani family, as well as the Armenian merchants. The formation of a loyal fraction was also necessary in the context of a confrontation with the Ministerial bureaucracy, whose ties with local institutions were suppressed or extremely formalized. Loyalty of clients was provided by promotions, awards and material prosperity. The system created by Vorontsov proved to be durable. His successors also relied in the capital on the Caucasian Committee and its Director, and within the Viceroyalty - on the same corporations and individuals who were patronized by the first Caucasian Viceroy. © 2020 Saint Petersburg State University.

The article explores the practice of sifarish (leaning on someone to get something done) which, it is argued, cannot be seen within simplistic rubrics of ‘corruption’ but instead comprises a socially embedded ethical continuum. With one of the stated aims of digitisation being the displacing of informal mediation, the ethnographic material illuminates the efforts of low-level political actors to navigate emerging digital infrastructures. Digitisation, however, does not end mediation and carries with it ideological, political and economic interests. This, the article argues, enables state/people spaces of mediation to be commodified and marketized and further cements processes of marginalisation experienced by India’s Muslim minority. © The Author(s) 2020.","aadhaar; biometrics; bureaucracy; clientelism; commodification; creative destruction; Digital; India; mediation; patronage",,,,,,,"Aggarwal, A., Tyranny of MGNREGA’s monitoring system (2017) Economic & Political Weekly, 52 (37), p. 25; Ahmad, I., A different jihad: Dalit Muslims' challenge to Ashraf hegemony (2003) Economic and Political Weekly, 38 (46), pp. 4886-4891; Arendt, H., (1972) Crises of the republic: Lying in politics, civil disobedience on violence, thoughts on politics, and revolution, , Boston, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; Auyero, J., (2012) Patients of the State: The Politics of Waiting in Argentina, , New York, Duke University Press; Banerjee, O., Darbas, T., Brown, P.R., Historical divergence in public management of foodgrain systems in India and Bangladesh: Opportunities to enhance food security (2014) Global Food Security, 3 (3-4), pp. 159-166; Bear, L., Mathur, N., Introduction (2015) The Cambridge Journal of Anthropology, 33 (1), pp. 18-34; Bhat, M., The constitutional case against the Citizenship Amendment Bill (2019) Economic and Political Weekly, IIV (3), pp. 12-14; Bhatia, A., Bhabha, J., India’s Aadhaar scheme and the promise of inclusive social protection (2017) Oxford Development Studies, 45 (1), pp. 64-79; Breckenridge, K., (2014) Biometric State, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Carswell G, Chambers T, and De Neve G (2019) Waiting for the state: Gender, citizenship and everyday encounters with bureaucracy India., 37(4): 597–616; Carswell, G., de Neve, G., Paperwork, patronage, and citizenship: The materiality of everyday interactions with bureaucracy in Tamil Nadu, India (2020) Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, , Epub ahead of print 20 June 2020.

It emerged from the concepts of crowdsourcing and microfinance, and only due to the evolution of the internet to the so-called Web 2.0. Crowdfunding platforms have already distributed billions of dollars throughout the world and not only to businesses, but to scientific research as well. The possibilities brought by this kind of financing are many, which used to be limited to great disruptive ideas, imposing two challenges: having such ideas in a regular basis and getting funds continually. This difficulty was solved with the advent of Patreon, a crowdfunding platform, created in 2013, that allows people to become patrons of content creators. With monthly payments, Patreon allows these content creators to remain financially viable and free of editorial restraints, producing knowledge or entertainment. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to discuss how crowdfunding has been evolving and how the public is motivated to become patrons. To do so, an investigation of secondary data on crowdfunding history, evolution and benefits to companies and content producers and creators was conducted. After that, 14 in-depth interviews were undertaken with crowdfunders of web-based content in pursuance of comprehending them and why they pay these creators. In addition, a netnography of four patrons-only online communities was conducted, to understand these patrons as groups, as well as individuals. Results show that this kind of crowdfunding, as seen in Patreon, is a growing market filled with possibilities, with an audience interested in helping content producers and small businesses to thrive. Individuals that partake in this practice are interested in feeling like co-creators, as well as belonging to something, being part of a community. They feel involved with the producers and want to interact with them, to be closer to the people they look up to. Some consider the payment a donation, most consider the price for a service from a source they trust and whose content they enjoy. Either way, they believe they are helping someone who needs and deserves funding. In an online environment, these patrons even accept receiving less than they pay for, being satisfied with the social benefits of funding the projects. This topic's relevance is twofold. First, crowdfunding, and specially the Patreon kind of crowdfunding, is a growing business that is yet to reach its full potential and became truly widespread for creators, entrepreneurs, people seeking new and innovative products and services and even for investors. Second, Patreon and other crowdfunding platforms can now be seen by academics as a way to fund research, with less bureaucracy and more editorial freedom, which is a reason itself to bring this matter closer to the scientific community. © 2020 26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017.

Existing research tends to highlight political patronage logics of distribution, and scholarship focuses primarily on politicians’ motivations. But service decisions are often made by bureaucrats, who sometimes explicitly try to avoid capture and allocate on the basis of need. Using qualitative interviews and spatial regressions with geo-coded data from a solar panel program in Ghana, we examine such a situation. We show that, despite considerable efforts to thwart it, national-level civil servants were unable to fully resist political capture. While solar panel distribution partially corresponded to need for electricity, we find that panels also went to areas where voter turnout was historically inconsistent, likely to motivate voter turnout. The direction of these relationships was consistent across subnational space, but the magnitudes varied considerably and were strongest in districts adjacent to Lake Volta. Qualitative data analysis reveals that this subnational variation reflects the logistics of space and the historical politics of place. The article contributes to theories of distributive politics and of voting behavior, and highlights the need for subnational disaggregation across space. © 2019","Bureaucrats; Civil servants; Distributive politics; Geographically weighted regression (GWR); Political capture; Voter mobilization","bureaucracy; democracy; regression analysis; spatial analysis; voting behavior; Ghana; Lake Volta",,,,,"Carnegie Corporation of New York, CCNY; Indiana University, IU; African Studies Association, ASA","Akee, R., Copeland, W., Costello, E.J., Holbein, J.B., Simeonova, E., Family income and the intergenerational transmission of voting behavior: Evidence from an income intervention (2018), National Bureau of Economic Research; Ang, Y.Y., How China escaped the poverty Trap (2016), Cornell University Press Ithaca; Baicker, K., Finkelstein, A., The impact of medicaid expansion on voter participation: Evidence from the Oregon health insurance experiment (2018), National Bureau of Economic Research; Baldwin, K., When politicians cede control of resources: Land, chiefs and coalition building in Africa (2014) Comparative Politics, 46 (3), pp. 253-271; Bersch, K., Praca, S., Taylor, M.M., Bureaucratic capacity and political autonomy within national states: Mapping the archipelago of excellence in Brazil (2017) States in the developing World, , Miguel A.

Many studies point to electoral competition in response. They argue that incumbents who risk exit from office undertake reform to insure themselves against potentially hostile successors. This paper challenges this line of reasoning, arguing that it confounds two potential implications of electoral competition – potential and certain electoral losses – which yield contrary reform incentives. Certain exits from office may well incentivize reforms as insurance. Where elections are contested, however, incumbents face incentives to resist reforms that constrain discretion over state resources that provide incumbents with electoral advantage. This argument is developed and assessed with an institutional reform the literature has so far neglected: job stability protections (tenure) in politicized bureaucracies. A case analysis of the Dominican Republic and suggestive cross-country data confirm theoretical predictions: electoral uncertainty dis-incentivizes tenure reform. Electoral competition may thus be a double-edged sword for institutional reform. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","civil service reform; electoral competition; institutional reform; patronage; tenure",,,,,,"University College London, UCL","Alt, J.E., Lassen, D.D., Rose, S., The Causes of Fiscal Transparency: Evidence from the U.S. States (2006) IMF Staff Papers, 53, pp. 30-57; Beck, T., Clarke, G., Groff, A., Keefer, P., Walsh, P., New Tools in Comparative Political Economy: The Database of Political Institutions (2001) The World Bank Economic Review, 15, pp. 165-176; Benito Sanchez, A.B., La política del poder: Alianzas e interacciones partidistas estratégicas en República Dominicana (2010) Revista de Ciencia Política, 30, pp. 751-772; Berliner, D., The Political Origins of Transparency (2014) The Journal of Politics, 76, pp. 479-491; Berliner, D., Erlich, A., Competing for Transparency: Political Competition and Institutional Reform in Mexican States (2015) American Political Science Review, 109, pp. 110-128; Besley, T., Persson, T., State Capacity, Conflict, and Development (2010) Econometrica, 78, pp. 1-34; Carpenter, D.P., (2001) The Forging of Bureaucratic Autonomy: Reputations, Networks, and Policy Innovation in Executive Agencies, 1862–1928, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Charron, N., Dahlström, C., Lapuente, V., No Law Without a State (2012) Journal of Comparative Economics, 40, pp. 176-193; Collado, F., (2012) 1er.

Another aim of these books is to define and explain the administration of the state and the duties of rulers based on experience. In consequence of this they reflect the practical ethics of the period in which they were written. As such, they resemble practical handbooks written for rulers. Another point regarding the mirrors for princes works in which the political understanding of the era can be observed is that they generally use sacred texts in order to prove the political legitimacy or invalidity of the power, as well as the rightfulness or the unlawfulness of the claims to the throne. Evidences from the Quran and the hadith literature was almost always used to support such advocated opinions. In fact, during the Middle Ages when religion and politics were consid-ered coupled, it was unthinkable that religious elements should not be included in the works of state administration. The important point here is that the verses and hadiths were sometimes removed from their contexts and interpreted and explained in a way to support the ideology of the author or the ruler whom the author presented his work. In this study, we will try to reveal the subjects in which the verses and hadiths used in the mirrors for princes, which is a genre that has emerged within the Islamic culture and civilization. Thus, we aim to prepare a background for the future studies, which will focus on a specific verse or hadith. Summary: The first political splits in Islamic history occurred immediately after the death of prop-het Muhammad. These differences were resolved by the agreement of the majority of Muslims on Abu Bakr's name. Until the second half of the rule of the third caliph Uthman, Muslims came together around the unifying power of the idea of conquest. Nevertheless, substantially as a result of economically based problems the period of tranquility in Islamic society came to an end and was replaced by disputes. Disputes turned into conflict and ultimately seperation fused with the massacre of Uthman in the capital Medina turned into a big fire with the Battles of the Camel and Siffin, the emergence of Kharijis, the formation of the Shia and the deepening of the intellectual divisions after the all of these. Islamic history has witnessed a clash of different religious views and beliefs. along with deepening of intellectual disagreements as a result of political debates In the Islamic political thought, especially the first two centuries process was formed around the views of the jurists, muhaddiths and theologians. The first sources used by those who tried to justify their opinion in the differences of opinion experienced during this period were the Quran and hadith literature which Muslims accepted as the determining factor in all their acts. The views based on the Qur'an and the hadiths, which are the two main sources of Islamic religion, had been used to influence the people, legitimize the actions and refute the claims of the opponents. On the other hand the sort who gave direction to political thought changed and political thought ad-hered a new path with Turks and Persians served as bureaucrats and soldiers and took an active position in the state. Especially Persians carried the culture of advice to Islamic thought, which is the product of both Greek and Hind civilization. Such books had brought in the Islamic society with translation movements began in the Umayyad period and peaked with the Bayt al-Hikma in the Abbasid period. Together with these books, the ideas of these civilizations on ideal state administ-ration, politics and morality were recognized by Muslim scholars. These type of works, which are famous in terms of Islamic thought as mirrors for princes, have been written by Muslim scholars since the middle of the eighth century. Mirrors for princes are political, moral and religious content books that gives the rulers practical advice to maintain their power in accordance with the religious orders and prohibitions, and to the consent of Allah's who grant them this authority and people which appointed for their administration. Mirrors for princes are mostly theoretical books since they are mostly focused on what should be. In addition, since they are written for names that currently hold power, they are centered on how the rulers can maintain and increase their power and with which practices the state will maintain its existence for a longer period. The basic point of political thought and political interpretation are concepts and definitions. When the concept meaning of a word is mentioned, it is generally considered that there is a general definition. However, the concepts reflect the meaning that the user assigns to him in the context of his thoughts, perceptions, criticisms, explanations and analyzes. Concepts such as fair, honest, brave, hero, beautiful, rich, good and clean express what the person imposes on the meaning. In other words, everyone's experience determines the content of the concept so far. The meaning of the concepts varies with the age and its user of that concept. Even concepts such as justice, merit and consultation can change meaning in different periods and geographies. The concepts, which are often used to facilitate understanding, are sometimes used to judge, to mold or mislead the interlocutor. In this context, it is imperative to enter the mind of the user in order to make concept analysis. In Islamic civilization, the principles of management are explained with concepts. The idiosyncra-sies that Muslims expect from an ideal ruler are defined as justice, consultation, merit, trust and legitimacy and a broad corpus has been written about the concepts related to the administration, especially those mentioned. One type of this corpus is mirrors for princes. In Islamic history, there are many Mirrors for princes who are written in different time periods by names coming from different geographies and different backgrounds. Although the advice given in Mirrors for princes indicate a great similarity to each other, the preferred arguments and examples in the foundation of the counsel are different. While the persons in active politics mostly based their opinions on political arguments, scholars with scientific tradition supported their ad-vices with religious arguments. Verses are the leading religious elements highlighted in Mirrors for princes. While explaining the concepts and emphasizing the importance of the advices, many verses have been exploited. Some verses are used only by one author, while some verses are the subject of their work by many authors. In the same way, hadiths and the sentences accepted as hadiths were also used to rein-force the emphasis and meaning. At this point, sometimes the context of the verses and hadiths were not taken care of. In this study, we aim to address the use of religious elements. In the literature, different opinions have emerged about who is ulu'l-emr and the limits of obe-dience to ulu'l-emr that used describe the names of senior executives and leaders of society. The reason for the difference is that each sect or religious school provides an interpretation on the basis of grounding its own views in explaining the verse. Justice is the most emphasized concept among the advices given to the rulers in mirrors for princes. Justice, which is shown as the most important feature of a sovereign, has been regarded as extremely important for the state to exis-tences until the Doomsday. In addition, justice has been described as the most important condi-tion for the maintenance of the state/sovereign authority. Consultation was important to make the right decision. Verses and hadiths were used in the explanations about the personal characte-ristics of the sovereign. Some features such as being compassionate, keeping promise, controlling anger, patience, honesty, blessing, extravagance, self-esteem, break a promise, revoke a promise and arrogance have become the subject of politics. When the mirrors for princes are considered as a whole, it is seen that religion and state are con-sidered as inseparable twin brothers, taken one step further the understanding that accepts reli-gion and the world as brothers especially is a product of the old Persian tradition. In this unders-tanding, religion was accepted as the root and was given the duty of its patronage to political authority. It is seen that in the Mirrors for princes verses and hadiths hold a significant amount. As the reason for this can be said that along with religion takes place on the basis of morality, the authors of the Mirrors for princes, which put deep meanings on the relationship between religion and the state in the period that we are dealing with, consider both institutions to be complemen-tary and integrative. © Published by Sivas Cumhuriyet Universitesi, Ilahiyat Fakultesi / Sivas Cumhuri-yet University, Faculty of Theology, Sivas, 58140 Turkey.","Hadith; History of islam; Mirrors for princes; Political concept; Verse",,,,,,,"Selçukname. haz (1977) Erdoğan Merçil, , I˙stanbul: Kervan Kitapçilik; Bagley, F.R.C., (1964) Ghazali's Book of Counsel for Kings (Nasihat al-Muluk), , London: University of Durham Publications; Bağdatli, O., (2018) I˙slâm Siyaset Düşüncesinin Kavramsal Temelleri, , I˙stanbul: Dergâh Yayinlari; Black, A., (2011) The History of Islamic Political Thought From the Prophet to the Present, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Bozkurt, N., (2014) Abbasiler, , I˙stanbul: I˙sam Yayinlari; Canatan, K., (2014) I˙slâm Siyaset Düşüncesi ve Siyasetnâme Geleneği, , I˙stanbul: Doğu Kitabevi; Çifçi, O.Z., Mâverdî Düşüncesinde Din-Devlet I˙lişkisi (2012) Iğdir Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi, 2, pp. 81-99. , Sayi/No: Ekim; Tarihu Ebu'l-Fida: El-Muhtasar fi Ahbari'l-Beşer, , I˙stanbul: Darü't-Tibaati'l-Amire 1286/1870; Nasîhatü'l-Mülûk Nşr.

The Bengalis were looked upon by the British as deficient in masculinity, yet ironically a large proportion of the Westernised bureaucrats through whom India was ruled were Bengali Clerks or Babus. They formed the prime example of effeminacy.2 It is very important to examine how this games ethic got injected into the veins of these ‘effeminate’ Babus. How much spontaneous or induced it was? What were the factors that played important role in the spread of games in Bengal? The study tries to highlight the various ways through which sporting culture circulated among the Bengalis. Instead of offering a monocausal explanation, it is important to underline the aspect of multiple causalities. In this article, weightage has been given to the efforts of Anglo-Indian schools and various colleges, such as Presidency College, Scottish Church, St. Paul’s College and St. Xavier’s College, in spreading the sports culture. After looking into various sources and college magazines, it can be concluded that much emphasis was given to the Western sports. © 2020 ICHR.","Bengal; clubs; colleges; Games ethic; princely patronage; schools; spread of games ethic",,,,,,,"Bagal, J.C., Mukhopadhyay, S.S., (2011) Hindu Melar Ittibritta, , Kolkata; Bandopadhyay, K., Games Ethic in Bengal: A Commentary on the Sporting Tradition of the Scottish Church College 175 Year Commemorative Volume, , Scottish Church College, ‘, ’; Bandopadhyay, K., (2008) Playing for Freedom: A Historic Sports Victory, , New Delhi; Bandopadyay, S., (1982) Khelar Raja Football, , Kolkata; Basu, G., Bengal’s Body Building Movement and the Historical Shield Victory: 1870–1911 Social History of Sports: The Indian Context, , Palit C., (ed), New Delhi, ‘, ’, ed; (1908), Bengal Administrative reports; Bhattacharya, R., (2014) Burdwanerkheladhulaprasanga, , Burdwan; Bose, M., (2012) The Spirit of the Game: How Sports Made the Modern World, , Chicago; Chowdhury, I., (1998) The Frail Hero and Virile: Gender and the Politics of Culture in Colonial Bengal, , New Delhi; (1942) Cooch Behar Darpan, , December; Dasgupta, S., (2005) Cooch Behar Jelar Khela Dhula: Sekal r Ekal, , July, ‘, ’, Cooch Behar JelaSankha, Issue 12; (1933), 2, December, Desh; Dimeo, P., ‘Colonial Bodies, Colonial Sports: “Martial” Punjabis, “Effeminate” Bengalis and the Development of Indian Football’ (2002) The International Journal of the History of Sports, 19 (1), pp. 72-90; Majumdar, B., ‘Imperial Tool “For” Nationalist Resistance’: The Games Ethic in Indian History’ (2004) The International Journal of History Sports, Vol 21 (3-4), pp. 384-401. , June–September; Majumdar, B., ‘Maharajas and Cricket: Self, State, Province and Nation’ (2005) The International Journal of the History of Sports, Vol 22 (4), pp. 639-648. , July; Majumdar, B., Tom Brown Goes Global: The “Brown” Ethic in Colonial and Post-colonial India p. 820 (2006) The International Journal of the History of Sports, Vol 23 (5). , August, ‘, ’; Mangan, J.A., ‘Soccer as a Moral Training: Missionary Intensions and Imperial Legacies’ (2001) Soccer in South Asian: Empire, Nation and Diaspora, , Dimeo Paul, Mill James, (eds), London, eds; Mangan, J.A., (2000) Athleticism in Victoria and Edwardian Public School: The Emergence and Consolidation of an Educational Ideology, , Cambridge; Mangan, J.A., (1998) The Games Ethic and Imperialism: Aspects of the Diffusion of an Ideal, , Portland; Mangan, J.A., IKuo, A., Sportsmanship English Inspiration and Japanese Response: F.W Strange and Chiyosaburo Takeda’ (2002) Sports in Asian Society, , Mangan, Hong Fong, (eds), London, ‘, eds; Metcalf, T.R., (1995) Ideologies of the Raj, , UK; Palit, C., (2014) Social History of Sports: The Indian Context, , Kolkata, (ed; , 38-43, pp. 167-169. , Paschimbanga, Hoogly Jela Sankha, Year 21, Sankha; Roy, N.R., Down the Perspective of the Years, , ‘, ’, ST Paul’s College, Golden Jubilee, Commemorative ume, 1900–50; Said, E., (1978) Orientalism, , USA; (1914) The College Gymnasium, , 5, March, ‘, ’; Sen, R., (2015) Nation at Play: A History of Sports in India, , Haryana; Shill, A.K., Princely Patronage and Popularly of Modern Sports: Contribution of the Maharajas of Cooch Behar HISTORIA: Journal of Social Science and Historical Studies, Vol II. , West Bengal, ‘, ’, 2012–13; Stoddard, B., (2008) Sports, Culture and History: Region, Nation and Globe, , St. Paul’s College, Golden Jubilee, Commemorative ume, London; (1920) The Statesman, , 13, January; (1920), University Report of St Pauls College; Van Der Veer, P., (2001) Imperial Encounters: Religion and Modernity in India and Britain, , Oxford",,,"SAGE Publications Inc.",,,,,03769836,,,,"English","Indian Hist.

However, none have described how the Bureau of Internal Revenue implemented the tax in only six months on a shoestring budget. William H. Osborn, the commissioner who oversaw the effort, left a diary of his experiences, which sheds light on the political, budgetary, and bureaucratic challenges he faced. While most internal revenue commissioners work in relative obscurity, Osborn won public acclaim by pursuing long-neglected evasions with headline grabbing criminal cases, pushing against patronage to hire qualified agents, and instituting cost-saving efficiencies. He melded political acumen, administrative genius, and a talent for inspiring his employees to build the basic framework for modern federal income tax collections. His experiences highlight the important, but often overlooked, role played by skilled bureaucrats. © 2019, American Accounting Association.

While considered an effective instrument to safeguard political control over ministerial bureaucracy, partisanship of senior civil servants is likewise associated with patronage and is deemed detrimental to professionalism and meritocracy. To scrutinize this contradiction, the article examines how the party-political background of senior civil servants influences their decision-making behaviour. Two theoretically derived conceptions of loyalty are therefore put to the test: responsiveness and responsibility. Effects are captured by using the vignette technique in 40 in-depth interviews with former senior civil servants from ministerial departments at federal and state level in Germany. The results are surprising in so far as they reveal that politicized senior civil servants act neither more responsively nor less responsibly than their non-politicized peers. These findings challenge common assumptions and call for a more refined analysis of the conditions under which politicization leads to negative effects. © 2019 The Author.

These differences could be partially responsible for divergence in the effectiveness of policy implementation, corruption levels, and economic development. Do imperial legacies contribute to the observed variation in the organization of public administrations? Historical foreign rule and colonization have been shown to have lasting effects on legal systems, political institutions, and trade in former controlled territories. Imperial legacies could also explain variations in the performance of public administrations. The author uses the case of Poland to investigate the long-term effects of foreign rule on bureaucratic systems. Historically, Poland was split between three imperial powers with very different public administrations: Prussia, Austria, and Russia. Statistical analyses of original data collected through a survey of more than 650 Polish public administrations suggest that some present-day differences in the organization and efficiency of bureaucracies are due to imperial legacies. © 2019 Trustees of Princeton University.","administrative culture; Austria; Austria-Hungary; bureaucratic efficiency; bureaucratic organization; centralization; colonial origins; competitiveness of recruitment; corruption; culture and institutions; decentralization; developing countries; direct rule; Eastern Europe; empires; external imposition of institutions; foreign rule; German Empire; imperial legacies; indirect rule; institutional persistence; long nineteenth century; meritocracy; modern bureaucracy; path dependence; patronage; perceptions of public institutions; Poland; Prussia; public administration; public sector recruitment; Russia; state building; state capacity",,,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Cantoni, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J.A., The consequences of radical reform: The French revolution (2011) American Economic Review, 101 (7), pp. 3286-3307; Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J.A., The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation (2001) American Economic Review, 91 (5), pp. 1369-1401; Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J.A., Reversal of fortune: Geography and institutions in the making of the modern world income distribution (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (4), pp. 1231-1294; Alesina, A., Giuliano, P., Culture and institutions (2015) Journal of Economic Literature, 53 (4), pp. 898-944; Marina, A.L., Girod, D.M., Indigenous origins of colonial institutions (2014) Quarterly Journal of Political Science, 9 (3), pp. 371-406; Baberowski, J., (2014) Der Rote Terror.

But walls erected starting in the eighth century are very different and distinctively 'medieval'. The late seventh/early eighth century therefore represents a moment of rapid transition or even rupture in the Roman building industry, when older ways of doing things ceased forever. Drawing on recently excavated structures on the Palatine and at San Paolo fuori le Mura that offer new insights into this crucial transitional period, I suggest that the break with centuries-old building traditions reflects a fundamental shift in mechanisms of patronage, and of control over the city's built environment. After a hiatus in the second half of the seventh century, when the Roman construction industry languished between a Byzantine administration in decline and a Church bureaucracy not yet empowered to supplant it, early eighth-century popes faced the challenge of creating anew the means and methods to build on a substantial scale. The newly excavated structures of the early eighth century offer an unexpected perspective on the growth of, and the growing pains experienced by, Rome's nascent papal government. © 2019 British School at Rome.",,,,,,,,"Andaloro, M., I cantieri di Giovanni VII (2016) Santa Maria Antiqua Tra Roma e Bisanzio, pp. 212-219. , M.

Yet we know next to nothing about the determinants of such patronage. Are democratic governments more or less inclined than autocratic ones to seek legitimacy through religious patronage? Is it ultimately ideological struggles that determine the extent of government backing of religion? This article addresses these questions through an analysis of the evolution of the state’s role as patron and protector of Buddhism (and other officially recognized religions) in Thailand.

Using unique Swedish municipal data from 2009 to 2015, it demonstrates that when one party dominates local politics, noncompetitive outcomes from public procurement processes are more common. What is most striking is that the risk of receiving only one bid, on what is intended to be an open and competitive tender, considerably increases with long-standing one-party rule. The article contributes to a significant body of work on the detrimental effects of low political competition, and the results are particularly interesting from a comparative perspective because Sweden—an old democracy with a meritocratic bureaucracy, characterized by low levels of corruption and clientelism—is a highly unlikely case in which to find such tendencies. © The Author(s) 2019.","bureaucracies; corruption and patronage; local politics; political competition; political economy; political parties; public procurement; Sweden",,,,,,"SGO14-1147:1; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, RJ","Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J., (2012) Why nations fail: The origins of power, prosperity, and poverty, , New York, NY, Random House Digital; Alt, J., Lassen, D., The political economy of institutions and corruption in American states (2003) Journal of Theoretical Politics, 15, pp. 341-365; Amore, M.D., Bennedsen, M., The value of local political connections in a low-corruption environment (2013) Journal of Financial Economics, 110, pp. 387-402; Audet, D., Government procurement: A synthesis report (2002) OECD Journal on Budgeting, 2, pp. 149-194; Becker, G., Stigler, G., Law enforcement, malfeasance, and the compensation of enforces (1974) Journal of Legal Studies, 3, pp. 1-19; Bergh, A., Erlingsson, G., Sjölin, M., Öhrvall, R., (2013) Allmän nytta eller egen vinning?

Ray/Iran 1457–d. Istanbul 1520), is undoubtedly one of the most original and important intellectual figures in the Ottoman‒Iranian borderland in the sixteenth century. He lived in a very turbulent period and established different relationships with Iranian and Ottoman dynasties at the end of the fifteenth century and at the beginning of the sixteenth century. He and his works have been the focus of long-standing historical debates in Turkey that have continued to the present day. Until now, most modern scholarly works on Bidlisi have failed to provide a proper, in-depth textual and historical analysis. As a result, such modern works have come to present a skewed, romanticized image of Bidlisi, largely detached from the nature and dynamics of the historical context in which Bidlisi lived and evolved as an intellectual and writer. This paper provides a realistic appraisal of Bidlisi and discusses the shortcomings of modern historiography on him. By looking at Bidlisi and his corpus, and more specifically at the ways in which the latter was shaped by Bidlisi’s patronage relationships, the paper aims to open up a window into Bidlisi’s evolving mindset and worldview. In other words, through an in-depth analysis of his corpus and new archival sources the paper strives to unveil the intellectual life and career of an Iranian bureaucrat and historian positioned between Ottoman‒Iranian borderland and provide a glimpse into the nature of patronage in the sixteenth century. © 2019, © 2019 Association For Iranian Studies, Inc.","Aqquyunlu; Idris-i Bidlisi; Ottoman; Safavid; Shah Ismail; Sultan Selim",,,,,,,"Afshar, I., 555 Nuskheh-ye Farsi-ye Tarikh dar Ketabkhāne-hā-ye Istanbul Nāmeh-ye Bahārestān, 1, pp. 85-98; (2004) Futuhāt-e Shāhi: Tarikh-e Safavi az Āghāz ta Sāl-e 920, , Rezā Nasiri M., (ed), Tehran: Anjoman-e Asar va Mafakhir-e Farhangi,.

Are there differences among presidential mandates regarding the number of these professionals and their party affiliation? This study seeks to answer these questions, by building a new database that gathers the number of party-affiliated public officials that were appointed to Cargos de Direção e Assessoramento Superior (DAS) (position of director and high level consultant). Descriptive analysis found that the proportion of party-affiliated among appointees increased during the Workers’ Party (PT) governments and higher among appointed professionals that were not civil servant. The power-sharing among parties-mainly between the party of the president and the others-varies significantly according to the government. The partisan control over appointees is milder in middle-level and stronger at top-level positions. However, a minority of appointees are party members, even among the top-level bureaucracy. Therefore, we suggest that the political networks go beyond the party affiliations. To understand these networks it is necessary to reassess the role of party politics in shaping the executive agenda and enable reinterpretation of how presidents build and manage the government coalition and the support to their agenda in the legislative arena. © 2019, Fundacao Getulio Vargas.

Bureaucrats can facilitate or hinder politicians' ability to engage in voter-friendly spending around elections. To test this idea, we use civil service reforms undertaken by US states in the second half of the 20th century to study political budget cycles in highway spending under civil service and patronage. We find that under patronage, highway spending is 12% higher in election years and 9% higher in the year before an election. By contrast, under civil service highway spending is essentially smooth over the electoral cycle. These findings provide a novel way through which civil service rules can stabilize government activity. © 2019","Bureaucrats; Civil service reform; Highway spending; Political budget cycles",,,,,,,"Akhmedov, A., Zhuravskaya, E., Opportunistic political cycles: test in a young democracy setting (2004) Q.

Existing studies failed to examine how the role of clientelism changes with the increasing tenure of the incumbent party. Combining data from the Afrobarometer project and information about partisan turnover, this article shows that the longer a party has remained in power, the more clientelist exchanges in the form of club goods and patronage will serve to bolster popular support for the ruling party. This is mainly because lengthy party duration facilitates the politicization of bureaucracy and other state resources essential for clientelist exchanges. Understanding the evolving role of clientelism under electoral contestation has profound implications for the study of phenomena such as dominant-party rule and democratic erosion. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","Clientelism;

Drawing on ethnographic research from Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, it presents experiences of waiting around queuing and applying for paperwork, cards, and welfare schemes, in order to examine the role of temporal processes in the production of citizenship and citizen agency. An analysis of various forms of waiting – ‘on the day’, ‘to and fro’, and ‘chronic’ waiting – reveals how temporal processes operate as mechanisms of power and control through which state actors and other mediators produce differentiated forms of citizenship and citizens. Temporal processes and their material outcomes, we argue, are shaped by class, caste and religion, while also drawing on – and reproducing – gendered identities and inequalities. However, rather than being ‘passive’ patients of the state, we show how ordinary people draw on money, patronage networks and various performative acts in an attempt to secure their rights as citizens of India. © The Author(s) 2018.","citizenship; gender; India; paperwork; patronage; Time; waiting","bureaucracy; citizenship; ethnography; gender disparity; patron-client relations; spatiotemporal analysis; India",,,,,"SG151257; British Academy; University of Sussex","Appadurai, A., The capacity to aspire – Culture in terms of recognition (2004) Culture and Public Action, pp. 59-83. , Rao V., Walton M., (eds), Stanford, Stanford University Press, In:, (eds; Auyero, J., Patients of the state: An ethnographic account of poor people’s waiting (2011) Latin American Research Review, 46 (1), pp. 5-29; Auyero, J., (2012) Patients of the State: The Politics of Waiting in Argentina, , Durham, Duke University Press; Axelsson, L., Malmberg, B., Zhang, Q., On waiting, work-time and imagined futures: Theorising temporal precariousness among Chinese chefs in Sweden’s restaurant industry (2015) Geoforum, 78, pp. 169-178; Bissell, D., Animating suspension: Waiting for mobilities (2007) Mobilities, 2 (2), pp. 277-298; Carswell, G., De Neve, G., From field to factory: Tracing bonded labour in the Coimbatore powerloom industry, Tamil Nadu (2013) Economy and Society, 42 (3), pp. 430-454; Carswell, G., De Neve, G., T-shirts and tumblers: Caste, dependency and work under neoliberalisation in south (2014) India.

Given the rising incidence of dropout of private entrepreneurs causing premature closure of telecentres, it is important to understand and identify key variables that affect sustainability of the scheme. In appreciation of the difficulty associated with operationalisation of the term 'sustainability’ in this study we adopt ‘operational sustainability’ as an alternative to investigate the dynamics of sustenance. We have reviewed key literature about various dimensions of sustainability and their interrelationships in order to develop hypotheses about sustainability of the UDC and factors associated with it. Drawing on data collected from a survey of 538 private entrepreneurs and 41 interviews with government officials we show the extent to which various elements of the UDC eco-system contribute to its sustainability. The application of a structural equation model confirms that both financial and social outcomes of the UDC depend largely on inputs and contributions of various stakeholders. The paper concludes that effective engagement of private entrepreneurs is critical, as is governmental patronage, for ensuring operational sustainability of partnership-based telecentres like the UDC. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bangladesh; Digital divide; E-government; Sustainability; Telecentre","Behavioral research; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Government data processing; Bangladesh; Digital divide; E-governments; Government officials; Operational sustainability; Social outcomes; Structural equation modeling; Telecentre; Sustainable development",,,,,,"Abelson, P., Public Economics: Principles and Practices (2007), McGraw Hill Publishing Sydney; Abraham, W.T., Russell, D.W., Missing data: a review of current methods and applications in epidemiological research (2004) Curr.

The particularly harsh punishments meted out to these communities, in contrast to what has happened to other, otherwise similarly insubordinate local groups, calls for a specific explanation. This would seem to lie at least partly in the residents’ tactic of subversive archaism, in which residents, through a variety of performative acts, challenge the moral authority of bureaucracies modeled on Western prototypes and imbued with Western-derived and middle-class notions of order and style. While other elements (such as shifts in the distribution of patronage) may shed light on the selective character of the state’s reprisals, the threat that subversive archaism poses to the cultural legitimacy of state and municipal bureaucracies emerges as a broader way of accounting for the official deployment of violence against groups of people whose flamboyant traditionalism ostensibly represents them as the most fundamentally loyal citizens of all. © The Society for Ethnographic Theory.

Martha C. Ward’s even-handed account reveals the mechanisms-of politics, poverty, and public health policies-at work in the perpetual controversies surrounding reproductive rights and the delivery of health care services to the poor. Ward’s book begins in the early 1960s when Louisiana was among the most underdeveloped states and ranked at the bottom of all scales measuring illiteracy, illegitimacy, and infant mortality. Despite the free statewide Charity Hospital system, many routine preventive medical and public health services were not available to poor women and their children, particularly if they were black. But in the mid-1960s, a visionary group of doctors and health care practitioners began to clear the hurdles erected by law, church, and the medical-political establishment. By 1970 they had set up the first statewide family planning program for poor people in the United States. The Louisiana experiment was a spectacular success. The Ford, Rockefeller, and Kellogg Foundations poured millions of dollars into the program. The Great Society and War on Poverty programs placed a high priority on the health of poor mothers and infants. With the help of the population lobby-including Planned Parenthood and the Agency for International Development-the Family Health Foundation moved into Latin America and other developing areas. But in 1974, the bubble burst. Accusations of fiscal mismanagement, fraudulent statistics, patronage, and political payoffs led to federal indictments and jail sentences for top officials. Poor women and powerful men, the black and white communities, and the liberal and conservative medical factions were pitted against each other. With the collapse of the program, methods for handling the epidemic of adolescent pregnancies and the high infant mortality rate reverted to the state bureaucracies. Poor Women, Powerful Men is the first book-length account of the Louisiana experiment. In a clear and dispassionate voice, Ward demonstrates that many of the questions raised by the experiment persist. Is family planning an answer to the cycle of poverty, teenage pregnancies, and infant mortality? How can the conflict between private and public delivery of medical care be resolved? Where do the reproductive rights of women fit into governmentally supported birth control programs? We seem no closer today to answering these questions than the Louisiana Family Health Foundation was more than a decade ago. © 1986 Taylor & Francis.

It shows how the decline of first Mughal and then British patronage for Islamic learning, as well as the post-1857 British policy of non-interference in 'religious1 matters, opened up a space for Deobandi scholars to re-conceive the madrasa as a 'religious' institution rather than one engaged in the production of civil servants, to reimagine the lulama as stewards of public morality rather than professionals in the service of the state, and to reframe the knowledge they purveyed as 'religious' knowledge distinct from the 'useful' secular knowledge promoted by the British. The article treats this production of 'religious' knowledge and space as discourse of distinction similar to those explored elsewhere in this HSR Special Issue. © 2019 GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.

Communications liaisons stationed at garrisons and administrative seats compiled intelligence and news reports for supervising officials in distant locations. In Beijing, capital liaisons compiled documents into court gazettes and supervised the distribution of documents, seals of office, and imperial gifts to the provinces. Besides these responsibilities, capital liaisons acquired reputations for following personal and patronage agendas that undermined the integrity of the bureaucratic state. Longstanding financial and administrative inconsistencies within the Qing bureaucracy induced liaisons to misbehave. Still, characterizations of liaison malfeasance transformed over the course of the dynasty due to institutional developments including the implementation of new communications systems, the standardization of provincial administrations, and the expansion of office sales. Whereas liaisons in the early and mid-Qing periods were parties to political exchanges among the bureaucratic elite, by the dynasty's waning years, liaisons provided services for the larger population of bureaucratic personnel. The liaisons' transformation from spies into postmen, as seen through the eyes of official critics, offers an opportunity to evaluate the impact of major changes in the Qing bureaucracy upon some of its least known officeholders. © 2019 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","administrative crime; communications liaison; Qing bureaucracy; titang",,,,,,,"Bartlett, B.S., (1991) Monarchs and Ministers: The Grand Council in Mid-Ch'ing China, 1723-1820, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Bonk, J., (2014) Chinese Military Men and Cultural Practice in the Early Nineteenth Century Qing Empire (1800-1840), , PhD diss., Princeton University; Brunnert, H.S., Hagelstrom, V.V., (1912) Present Day Political Organization of China, , Shanghai: Kelly &Walsh; Tao, C., (1875) Tongzhi Zhongxing Jingwai Zouyi Yuebian (A Conspectus of Memorials of the Tongzhi Restoration), 8. , Beijing: Xiaoyou shanfang; Chi-Fa, C., (1979) Qingdai Zouzhe Zhidu (the Memorials System of the Qing Dynasty), , Taipei: Taipei gugong bowuyuan; Cole, J.H., (1986) Shaohsing: Competition and Cooperation in Nineteenth-Century China, , Tucson: University of Arizona Press; Qing, D., Huidian Shili (Collected Statutes and Precedents of the Qing Dynasty), , Guangxu edition (GX-HDSL ); Qing, D., Huidian Shili (Collected Statutes and Precedents of the Qing Dynasty, , Jiaqing edition (JQ-HDSL ); Qing, D., Huidian (Collected Statutes of the Qing Dynasty), , Kangxi edition (KXHD); Qing Huidian Zeli, D., (Collected Statutes and Precedents of the Qing Dynasty, , Qianlong edition (QL-HDZL ); De Weerdt, H., (2015) Information, Territory, and Networks: The Crisis and Maintenance of Empire in Song China, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Center; Jinjun, D., Qingmo gedi kaishe wenbaoju shiliao (sources on the establishment of document bureaus at the end of the qing dynasty) (1990) Lishi Dang'an (Historical Achives), 2, pp. 54-60; Elliott, M.C., The manchu-language archives of the qing dynasty and the origins of the palace memorial system (2001) Late Imperial China, 1, pp. 1-70; Fairbank, J.K., Teng, S.Y., On the transmission of ch'ing documents (1939) Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 1, pp. 12-46; Fairbank, J.K., Teng, S.Y., On the types and uses of ch'ing documents (1940) Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 1, pp. 1-71; Yanwu, G., (1980) Tinglin Wenji (Writings of Gu Yanwu). 6 Vols.

Ottoman presence and authority in the urban landscape was symbolised by modern secular bureaucratic buildings such as the government palace, the government house, the town hall, the revenue office, the post office, prisons, banks, schools, hospitals and military barracks in this era. Tanzimat Reforms also had bearings on the vernacular architecture in Mardin. The granting of a modern system of equal citizenship in this era paved the way for the city’s Christian communities to establish several new churches and renovate existing ones. Ottoman elites sent from the centre, or new bureaucrats appointed from local Muslim, Christian and Jewish communities, influential noble families, tradesmen and artisans have commissioned elaborate domestic buildings. While indigenous architectural types and decorative styles are observed mostly in the elite houses and religious architecture, official and municipal buildings, commissioned by the patronage of centrally appointed bureaucrats, display predominantly neoclassical arrangement, which is the favoured style of the government buildings of the Tanzimat and post-Tanzimat eras of Ottoman Empire. © 2018, Florida Gulf Coast University.

Naval elites, a social group formed by a part of the naval officer corps and midshipmen, are here defined as a historical instrument, the particular and intriguing features of which may be useful in the revision of some perspectives on social change. In particular, the authors analyse shifting power relationships through the reconsideration of naval patronage and bureaucracy, revisit the process of naval professionalization and the transformation of the concept of merit, and suggest that naval elites embodied new notions of social distinction and exclusiveness. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","eighteenth century; naval officers; patronage; professionalization; Social change; social distinction",,,,,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: HAR2013-48901-C6-1-R","Acerra, M., André, Z., (1997) L’essor des marines de guerre européennes: 1680–1790 [The Rise of the European Navies, 1680–1790], , Paris: SEDES; Acerra, M., Merino, J., Meyer, J., (1998) Les marines de guerre européennes, XVIIe-XVIIIe siécles [The European Navies, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries], , Paris: Presses Paris Sorbonne; Alfonsi, L., L’enseignement scientifique et technique au XVIIIe siècle, dans les écoles des Gardes de la Marine: le rôle essentiel d’Etienne Bézout (1730–1783) [Scientific and Technical Education in the Eighteenth Century in the Midshipmen Schools: the Essential Role of Etienne Bézout (1730–1783)] (2008) Espaces de l’enseignement scientifique et technique.

Governors are more likely to be promoted to higher salaried colonies when connected to their superior during the period of patronage. Once allocated, they provide more tax exemptions, raise less revenue, and invest less. The promotion and performance gaps disappear after the abolition of patronage appointments.

In this article, we argue that electoral coordination requires partisan control of patronage distribution by local bureaucracies. In electoral constituencies in which bureaucrats do not hold a monopoly over the distribution of patronage, we might see constituency-level electoral fragmentation. In constituencies in which the bureaucracy controls patronage, however, effective coordination yields Duvergerian equilibria. We formulate and test this argument through constituency- and precinct-level analysis of Pakistani elections and additional evidence from Indian elections. © 2018 City University of New York.

This article advances an alternative view that emphasizes their enabling effects. I argue that patron–client relations can be used to improve government performance by resolving principal–agent problems within political hierarchies. I substantiate this claim by examining how patronage networks shape economic performance of local governments in China. Using an original city–level panel data set between 2000 and 2011, and a new method that identifies patronage ties based on past promotions, I show that city leaders with informal ties to the incumbent provincial leaders deliver significantly faster economic growth than those without. I conduct additional analyses to rule out several important alternative explanations and provide evidence on the incentive-enhancing mechanism. These findings highlight the importance of informal institutions for bureaucratic management and authoritarian governance. ©2018, Midwest Political Science Association",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: SES-1560513; University of Pennsylvania, Penn; University of Chicago","Alchian, A.A., Demsetz, H., Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization (1972) American Economic Review, 62 (5), pp. 777-795; Ang, Y.Y., (2016) How China Escaped the Poverty Trap, , Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press; Arriola, L.R., Patronage and Political Stability in Africa (2009) Comparative Political Studies, 42 (10), pp. 1339-1362; Baker, G., Gibbons, R., Murphy, K.J., Relational Contracts and the Theory of the Firm (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (1), pp. 39-84; Barnard, C.I., (1968) The Functions of the Executive, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Bell, D.A., (2015) The China Model: Political Meritocracy and the Limits of Democracy, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Bendor, J., Glazer, A., Hammond, T., Theories of Delegation (2001) Annual Review of Political Science, 4, pp. 235-269; Blaydes, L., (2010) Elections and Distributive Politics in Mubarak's Egypt, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Boix, C., Svolik, M.W., The Foundations of Limited Authoritarian Government: Institutions, Commitment, and Power-Sharing in Dictatorships (2013) Journal of Politics, 75 (2), pp. 300-316; Brehm, J., Gates, S., When Supervision Fails to Induce Compliance (1994) Journal of Theoretical Politics, 6 (3), pp. 323-343; Breton, A., Wintrobe, R., (1982) The Logic of Bureaucratic Conduct: An Economic Analysis of Competition, Exchange, and Efficiency in Private and Public Organizations, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Brownlee, J., (2007) Authoritarianism in an Age of Democratization, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Cai, H., Treisman, D., Did Government Decentralization Cause China's Economic Miracle?

South Sudan has failed to institute functional institutions; institutions which could have initiated peace-guaranteeing conditions, ensure national cohesion, and spur economic development and prosperity. This has created war-enabling conditions and made peace and security almost impossible to realize. Some of the reasons advanced by experts, foreign diplomats and other stakeholders with intimate knowledge of South Sudanese history, include lack of political will, militarized mentality, political and economic patronage, tribalized politics, kleptocracy, and the general desire to amass wealth. While the mentioned causal factors have undermined state formation and institutional structures, this article contends that the current South Sudanese political quagmire stemmed from a lack of disciplined and conscientious leadership that could have dealt with the above mentioned problems. The chapter aims to show how the lack of leadership undermined nascent institutional structures and protocols as leaders failed (or didn’t know how) to give problems context, guide civil servants, and prescribe fact-based governance models. A sound leadership, notwithstanding lack of experienced local civil servants and nascent institutional structures, would have strategized in a manner that focuses on addressing state shortcomings in consistent, forward-looking modalities outlined in the South Sudan Development Plan (2011-2013). © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Steven C.

Shifting from universal-access social programs, like fuel subsidies, to targeted programs requires vesting authority with local politicians and bureaucrats, whom the state relies on to identify poor households and to deliver benefits. Where local governments are corrupt, citizens find promises to replace fuel subsidies with targeted spending less credible and resistance to reform is higher. Using household survey data from Indonesia, this article finds that corruption in the implementation of targeted transfer programs increases resistance to fuel subsidy reform among the poor citizens who consume the least fuel and who stand to benefit the most from targeted programs. Findings suggest that improving capacity within subnational governments to deliver social programs is important in developing public support for reform. © The Author(s) 2018.","corruption and patronage; fuel subsidies; Indonesia; social welfare programs; subnational politics",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Australian Agency for International Development, AusAID","(2013) Nigeria (Round 5), , http://afrobarometer.org/countries/nigeria-0, Retrieved from; Alderman, H., (2002) Subsidies as a social safety net: Effectiveness and challenges, , Washington, DC, The World Bank, (Social Protection Discussion Paper Series; Anderson, C., Tverdova, Y., Corruption, political allegiances, and attitudes towards governments in contemporary democracies (2003) American Journal of Political Science, 47, pp. 91-109; Arze del Granado, J., Coady, D., Gillingham, R., The unequal benefits of fuel subsidies: A review of evidence for developing countries (2012) World Development, 40, pp. 2234-2248; Auerbach, A., Clients and communities (2016) World Politics, 68, pp. 111-148; (2011) Pendataan Potensi Desa (Data on Village Potential), , Jakarta, Indonesia, Badan Pusat Statistik, [,]; Banerjee, A., Hanna, R., Kyle, J., Olken, B., Sumarto, S., The role of competition in effective outsourcing: Subsidized food distribution in Indonesia Journal of Political Economy, , (in press-a; Banerjee, A., Hanna, R., Kyle, J., Olken, B., Sumarto, S., Tangible information and citizen empowerment: Identification cards and food subsidy programs in Indonesia Journal of Political Economy, , (in press-b; Bardhan, P., Mookherjee, D., Decentralizing antipoverty program delivery in developing countries (2005) Journal of Public Economics, 89, pp. 675-704; Bates, R., (1981) Markets and states in tropical Africa: The political basis of agricultural policies, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Bayu, D.J., Distribution of Indonesia’s smart card reaches 70 percent (2016) Kompas, , http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2016/11/08/22563281/penyaluran.kartu.indonesia.pintar.capai.70.persen, November, 8, (,)., [,]., Retrieved from; Beaton, C., Lontoh, L., Wai-Poi, M., Indonesia: Pricing reforms, social assistance, and the importance of perceptions (2017) The political economy of energy subsidy reform, , Inchauste G., Victor D., (eds), Washington, DC, The World Bank, (Eds.), (Chapter 4; Bellemare, M., Rising food prices, food price volatility, and social unrest (2015) American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 97, pp. 1-21; Benes, K., Cheon, A., Urpelainen, J., Yang, J., (2016) Low oil prices: An opportunity for fuel subsidy reform, , http://www.theigc.org/blog/low-oil-prices-an-opportunity-for-fuel-subsidy-reform/, International Growth Center, Retrieved from; Bril-Mascarenhas, T., Post, A., Policy traps: Consumer subsidies in post-crisis Argentina (2015) Studies in Comparative International Development, 50, pp. 98-120; Burgoon, B., Globalization and backlash: Polanyi’s revenge?

Drawing on interview data with 100 research subjects in Vietnam’s real estate market, this article makes contributions to the literatures of economic sociology and development. First, looking at a diverse set of local, regional, and global investors, I theorize how market actors pursue different strategies to manage risky investments based on their proximity to state officials. Investors’ proximity depends on four processes: legal/regulatory, social ties, cultural matching, and stage of investment. Second, I highlight how multiple state–market relations can coexist within the same state. Investors’ varying levels of proximity to government officials shape their relationship with the state as one of patronage (predatory), mutual destruction (mutual hostage), or transparency (developmental). Heterogeneous state–market relations help account for the persistence of foreign direct investment in markets that display both a great deal of corruption and a great deal of legality and transparency. © American Sociological Association 2018.","development; economic sociology; emerging markets; globalization; law","corruption; economic development; foreign direct investment; globalization; housing market; risk assessment; state-business relations; Viet Nam",,,,,"Social Science Research Council, SSRC; University of California Berkeley, UC Berkeley","Abbott, A., (2016) Processual Sociology, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Abrams, P., Notes on the Difficulty of Studying the State (1988) Journal of Historical Sociology, 1 (1), pp. 58-89; Bandelj, N., The Global Economy as Instituted Process: The Case of Central and Eastern Europe (2009) American Sociological Review, 74 (1). , (,):128–49; Bandelj, N., Relational Work and Economic Sociology (2012) Politics and Society, 40 (2), pp. 175-201; Bandelj, N., Wherry, F., Zelizer, V., Introduction (2017) Money Talks: Explaining How Money Really Works, pp. 1-24. , Bandelj N., Wherry F., Zelizer V., (eds), Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press,,., –, edited by; Beauchamp, Z., How Donald Trump’s Kleptocracy Is Undermining American Democracy (2017) Vox, , https://www.vox.com/world/2017/7/31/15959970/donald-trump-authoritarian-children-corruption, July, 31, March, 5, 2018,,., Retrieved; Beresford, M., Doi Moi in Review: The Challenges of Building Market Socialism in Vietnam (2008) Journal of Contemporary Asia, 38 (2). , (,):221–43; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Buckley, P., Chen, L., Clegg, J., Voss, H., Experience and FDI Risk-Taking: A Microfoundational Reconceptualization (2016) Journal of International Management, 22 (2). , (,):131–46; Burt, R.S., (2005) Brokerage and Closure: An Introduction to Social Capital, , New York, Oxford University Press; Bussell, J., (2013) Varieties of Corruption: The Organization of Rent-Seeking in India, , Presented at the Westminster Model of Democracy Crisis? conference, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; Chan, C.S.-C., Invigorating the Content in Social Embeddedness: An Ethnography of Life Insurance Transactions in China (2009) American Journal of Sociology, 115 (3). , (,):712–54; Clemens, E.S., From City Club to Nation State: Business Netowrks in American Political Development (2010) Theory and Society, 39 (3-4). , (,):377–96; Cohen, M.S., Abernethy, J.S., Lee, S.N., Anti-Corruption Enforcement in Korea: Is an Old Law Coming of Age?

Specifically, it examines the everyday practices of local civil servants as they attempt to influence the distribution of such public resources as agricultural inputs and local government budgets. The article asks: how do local civil servants produce the authority necessary to get things done in the face of changing local government structures and rival authority claims from both wartime Maoist People's Governments and resurgent patronage politics in the post-war period? In a context characterized as 'ordinary extraordinary', the article suggests that local civil servants employ a form of practice that has been termed 'tactical government' and proposes three distinct forms of this practice. However, the article also argues that tactical practice tells only part of the story and that it can be insightful to enrich our understanding of tactical government with an analysis of more general life projects. Bureaucratic practices are also motivated by factors such as the significance of the contested resource and paternal ideas of 'the common good'. Such a suggestion is in line with recent work on everyday lives in situations of protracted violent conflict and insecurity, and on the role of culture in producing civil servants/services. Looking at these two forms of practice together, in particular their interconnections, gives us a fuller account of how authority is produced. Furthermore, it allows more nuanced and detailed perspectives into the complex process of state-making.

Why do some public servants—yet not others—work hard to deliver public services, misuse state resources, and/or participate in electoral mobilization? A classic answer comes from Weber: Bureaucratic structures shift behavior toward integrity, neutrality, and commitment to public service. Our study conducts the first survey experimental test of the effects of bureaucratic structures. It does so through a conjoint experiment with public servants in the Dominican Republic. Looking at merit examinations and job stability, we find that Weber was right—but only partially. Recruitment by examination curbs corruption and political services by bureaucrats, while enhancing work motivation. Job stability, by contrast, only decreases political services: Tenured bureaucrats are less likely to participate in electoral mobilization. Examinations thus enhance the quality of bureaucracy (motivation and lower corruption) and democracy (electoral competition); job stability only enhances the quality of democracy. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","bureaucracy; conjoint experiment; merit; patronage; tenure; Weber",,,,,,,"(2014) The political culture of democracy in the Americas, 2014: Democratic governance across 10 years of the AmericasBarometer, , http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/ab2014/AB2014_Comparative_Report_English_V3_revised_011315_W.pdf, Retrieved from; Andersen, L.B., What determines the behaviour and performance of health professionals?

The analysis juxtaposes two consecutive stages of the state-building process, which are marked by different degrees and forms of international involvement: the pre-independence period, 1999–2008; and post-independence period, 2008–2016. Evidence from the case suggests that during the pre-independence period, legal inconsistencies embedded in the internationally promulgated legislation enabled local actors’ formal and informal strategies to recruit political cronies in the newly created civil service system. The transfer of authority from international administrators to elected local authorities, especially after Kosovo’s declaration of independence in 2008, did not solve the problem of legal inconsistencies, and instead, served to consolidate governing parties’ strategies of control over recruitment in the state bureaucracy. More often than not, patron–client relationships that thrive at the borderline between formality and informality of political behaviour, continued to undermine external rule transfers. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","civil service system; European Union; informality; international intervention; Kosovo; Post-conflict state-building; recruitment; state capture; United  Nations",,,,,,,"Belloni, R., Hybrid peace governance: Its emergence and significance (2012) Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations, 18 (1), pp. 21-38; Beysoylu, C., Implementing Brussels agreements: EU’s Facilitating strategy and contrasting local perceptions of peace in Kosovo (2018) Southeast European and Black Sea Studies, 18 (2). ,  , : 203-218; Bodszynski, M., (2010) Regime change in the Yugoslav successor states, , Baltimore, MD: John Hopkins University Press; Boletini, B., Kalaja, B., (2014) Employment Party, , http://preportr.cohu.org/en/investigations/Employment-Party-65, Pristina: Kosovo Center for Investigative Journalism; Briscoe, I., Price, M., (2011) Kosovo’s new map of power: governance, crime and independence, , http://bit.ly/2ofoc4H, The Clingendael Institute, and,. 1–52; Capussela, A., (2015) State building in Kosovo: Democracy, corruption and the EU in the Balkans, , London: Tauris; Coelho, J., Building state failure in Kosovo (2015) Contemporary Southeastern Europe, 2 (2), pp. 7-15; Diamandouros, N., Larrabee, S., Democratisation in south-eastern Europe: Theoretical considerations and evolving trends (2000) Experimenting with democracy: Regime change in the Balkans, pp. 24-64. , Pridham G., Gallagher T., (eds), Abingdon: Routledge, and,. eds; Doli, D., Korenica, F., Rogova, A., The post-independence civil service in Kosovo: A message of politicization (2012) International Review of Administrative Science, 78 (4), pp. 665-691; Elbasani, A., (2009) EU administrative conditionality and domestic downloading: The limits of europeanization in challenging contexts, , KFG Working Paper 2, Free University Berlin; Elbasani, A., (2013) European integration and transformation in the western Balkans: Europeanization or business as usual?, , Abingdon: Routledge, (ed; Elbasani, A., State-Building or state-capture?

This article traces his appointment to his personal links with Hughes’ National Federation. The circumstances, hitherto obscure, of Sheaf’s early activities are established drawing in part on his extensive photographic archive. Despite his irregular preferment, Sheaf was a highly perceptive analyst of trading conditions in Asia and provided important market intelligence for the Australian government. However, insufficient use was made of his work by Australia’s still rudimentary trade bureaucracy. Following his government service, he was a frequent sojourner in Asia, but many of his discoveries had to be repeated by the 1930s trade service. © 2018 Australian Historical Association.","Asian engagement; Asian markets; Australian trade commissioners; E.T.

Male and female members of the central elite supported the construction of the shrines in order to advance their respective political ambitions. Discontented with court factionalism, the central elite wielded their support of the shrines as a shaming device against their opponents and/or corrupt officials, while Buddhist monks sought to gain social recognition and enhance their respective monastery's political caché by maintaining the shrines, and by performing Confucian commemoration rituals with royal support.

By triangulating quantitative and qualitative survey data from a sample of Chinese cadres (n=286), the authors aim to answer the research question: ‘What is the behavioral impact of the incentive structure the cadre management system helps to shape, and does the incentive matrix support a meritocratic work environment?'. The findings demonstrate that the promotion of local leading cadres is primarily based on their superiors’ recognition and appreciation. A principal-component analysis reveals that what impresses the superiors includes both patronage and merit factors, although patronage has a slight edge over merit. This study also suggests that good interpersonal skills are essential for both merit- and patronageoriented career advancement. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"bureaucracy; incentive; principal component analysis; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; skilled labor; survey; China",,,,,"National University of Singapore, NUS: R-603-000-071-720","Friedman, T.L., Our one-party democracy The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/opinion/09friedman.html, accessed 1 June 2017; Mahbubani, K., Is China’s slowdown just Western wishful thinking?

The bureaucracy was formally organized on the premise that it existed to serve the King. The staff was comprised of close relatives of the King and commoners who rose to high—ranking posts on their own merits or through the King’s personal patronage. Thai bureaucracy continued relatively unchanged until the second half of the 19th century. Threats from colonial powers forced first King Mongkut and then his son King Chulalongkorn (1868–1910) to make major changes to strengthen internal unity in order to face this external challenge. © Ronald U.

Throughout its tenure, the government has utilised its political power, state resources and legal bureaucracy to boost the number and organisational capacity of Islamic civil society groups. Today, Islamic non-governmental organisations and charities have become partners to the state in social welfare management, resource allocation, poverty alleviation, information politics, and education. Examining the mechanisms of clientelism and patronage that shape the state-civil society relationship in the AKP’s Turkey, the chapter highlights the ways in which authoritarian regimes strategically cultivate associational activity. The findings of the study suggest that, rather than functioning as a self-governing force that provides a counterweight to state power, Islamic civil society in Turkey has contributed to the consolidation of an authoritarian neo-liberal regime. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Palash Kamruzzaman.",,,,,,,,"Abdelrahman, M.M., (2004) Civil society exposed: The politics of NGOs in Egypt, , London: I.B.Tauris; Acar, F., Altunok, G., The ‘politics of intimate’ at the intersection of neo-liberalism and neo-conservatism in contemporary Turkey (2013) Women’s Studies International Forum, 41 (P1), pp. 14-23; Adaman, F., Bugra, A., Insel, A., Societal context of labor union strategy: The case of Turkey (2009) Labor Studies Journal, 34 (2), pp. 168-189; Akkoyunlu, K., Öktem, K., Existential insecurity and the making of a weak authoritarian regime in Turkey (2016) Southeast European and Black Sea Studies, 16 (4), pp. 505-527; Armony, A., (2004) The dubious link: Civic engagement and democratization, , Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press; Atalay, Z., Vernacularization of liberal civil society by transnational Islamist NGO networks (2016) Global Networks, 16 (3), pp. 391-411; Aytac, S.E., Onis, Z., Varieties of populism in a changing global context: The divergent paths of Erdogan and Kirchnerismo (2014) Comparative Politics, 47 (1), pp. 41-59; Berman, S., Civil society and the collapse of the Weimar Republic (1997) World Politics, 49 (3), pp. 401-429; Bermeo, N., Nord, P., (2000) Civil society before democracy: Lessons from nineteenth-century Europe, , Oxford: Rowman & Littlefield; Boratav, K., The Turkish bourgeoisie under neoliberalism (2016) Research and Policy on Turkey, 1 (1), pp. 1-10; Bruff, I., The rise of authoritarian neoliberalism (2014) Rethinking Marxism, 26 (1), pp. 113-129; Bugra, A., Savaskan, O., Politics and class: The Turkish business environment in the neoliberal age (2012) New Perspectives on Turkey, 46, pp. 27-63. , March; Carothers, T., The end of the transition paradigm (2002) Journal of Democracy, 13 (1), pp. 5-21; Cavatorta, F., (2012) Civil society activism under authoritarian rule: A comparative perspective, , London: Routledge; Celik, A., Trade unions and deunionization during ten years of AKP rule (2013) Perspectives Turkey, 3, pp. 44-48; Çelik, A., Turkey’s new labour regime under the Justice and Development Party in the first decade of the twenty-first century: Authoritarian flexibilization (2015) Middle Eastern Studies, 51 (4), pp. 618-635; Cizakca, M., (2000) A history of philanthropic foundations: The Islamic world from the seventh century to the present, , Istanbul: Bogazici University Press; Clark, J., (1991) Democratizing development: The role of voluntary organizations, , London: Lynne Rienner; Cohen, J.L., Arato, A., (1994) Civil society and political theory, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Diamond, L., (1999) Developing democracy, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; Diamond, L., Rethinking civil society: Toward democratic consolidation (1994) Journal of Democracy, 5 (3), pp. 4-17; Dinler, D.Ş., (2012) Trade unions in Turkey.

Two variable dimensions of the bureaucratic design profoundly affect both the extent of bureaucratic power and the administrative capabilities of a bureaucracy: duration in office and the qualifications of officeholders. Empowered officials are better administrators than powerless ones, provided they cannot become politically dominant. A relatively stable semipowerful bureaucracy has emerged in the UnitedStates during the last century as a result of its exceptional mixture of short-termers and professionalized careerists. This mixture has enhanced the regime's administrative capabilities while curtailing bureaucratic power. The countries that experienced few or no military coups made the transition to modem bureaucracy before experiencing a radical proliferation in the number of salaried officials. Patronage has been largely eliminated in contemporary parliamentary regimes infavor of careerist bureaucracies. © 1994 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass; Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., Mandates or Mandarins?

Using data from a large-scale executive survey from central government ministries and agencies in 18 European countries, the article provides a comprehensive cross-national and cross-organizational analysis of the autonomy-politicization conundrum and the drivers of the politicization of senior-level appointments. We find that national patterns of politicization correspond fairly well to country families as defined by administrative traditions, with some traditions being more coherent than others. At the organizational level, we find no evidence of efforts by politicians to compensate for extended autonomy by politicizing senior-level appointments, yet we provide evidence of differential effects of both formal and informal organizational characteristics on patterns of politicization. Our analyses show that politicization of senior appointments is lower in organizations with agency status, higher organizational social capital, higher financial autonomy and more extensive use of management tools. The article thereby not only offers comprehensive evidence of cross-country differences in politicization; it also adds to the literature on sub-national variation, by fleshing out an organizational perspective to the study of politicized appointments in the European context. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.","Agencies; patronage; political control; politicization; public sector reform; senior civil service",,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 266887",,,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,09520767,,,,"English","Public Policy Adm.",Article in Press,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047408289

Design/methodology/approach: The study used two country case studies that engaged with stakeholders including donors, civil society, politicians, and civil servants. Semi-structured interviews were used as the main data collection technique, which were complemented by document analysis. Findings: The study finds that government accounting reforms are decoupled and used in both countries as a façade which is caused, to a varying degree, by indigenous neo-patrimonial governance traits of informal institutions, patronage, and clientelism. And despite the relatively superior Ghanaian system, in terms of its functioning, compared to the Beninese, government accounting plays a more symbolic role in the former than in the latter. Originality/value: This is one of the very few theoretically informed empirical studies that examine the state of government accounting in the two major African settings – Anglophone and Francophone. The results inform policies more tailored to indigenous governance issues for better outcomes. © 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Benin; Corruption; Decoupling; Ghana; Government accounting; Neo-patrimonialism",,,,,,,"Abrahamson, E., Baumard, P., What lies behind organizational façades and how organizational façades lie: an untold story of organizational decision making (2008) The Oxford Handbook of Organizational Decision Making, pp. 437-452. , Gerard, G., Hodgkinson, P. and Starbuck, W.H. and,(Eds), Oxford University Press, Oxford; Adhikari, P., Mellemvik, F., The rise and fall of accruals: a case of Nepalese central government (2011) Journal of Accounting in Emerging Economies, 1 (2), pp. 123-143; Adoun, W.H., Awoudo, F.K., (2008) Benin: une démocratie prisonnière de la corruption, , Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, Cotonou; Akakpo, M., (2015) Démocratie financière en Afrique Occidentale Francophone, , Friedrich Ebert Stiftung-Benin, Cotonou; Akakpo, M.B., (2009) Réflexions sur la Gouvernance Financière au Bénin, , Transparency International, Cotonou; Albu, N., Albu, C.N., Bunea, S., Calu, D.A., Girbina, M.M., A story about IAS/IFRS implementation in Romania (2011) Journal of Accounting in Emerging Economies, 1 (1), pp. 76-100; Andrews, M., (2010) How far have public financial management reforms come in Africa?, , working paper, John F.

Citizen distrust in government and its institutions considerably affects the effectiveness and efficiency of public policies and their implementation. Since the independence, Sri Lanka has been regarded as a third world democracy with a strong welfare state system in which public institutions have played pivotal role in fostering democracy and citizen trust. Nevertheless, in the recent past, citizen trust in most public institutions has been alarmingly decreasing owing to politicization of public sector, service delivery, political and bureaucratic corruption, lack of transparency, accountability, ethnic prejudice and partiality in the working of the public institutions. In this backdrop, this paper examines the level of citizen trust in selected institutions and explores factors that influence on trust. The study adopted mixed method approach to explore the problem phenomenon. The study finds that ethnic majority has more trust in public institutions than that of minority, and identity, language of administration and lack of equal representation in bureaucracy are also considerably determine level of trust citizens have in public institutions. Further, political patronage in service delivery has subverted quality of public institutions and trust, interestingly, citizens those who support and being affiliated with ruling party tend to have more trust in government. Police and village-level officers are least trusted owing to endemic corruption. © 2017, © 2017 Association of Asia Scholars.","government institutions; quality of government; service delivery; Sri Lanka; Trust",,,,,,,"Ariely, G., Public administration and citizen satisfaction with democracy: Cross-national evidence (2013) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 79 (4), pp. 747-766; (2004) Annual Report, , Philiines, Manila; Askvik, S., Jamil, I., The institutional trust paradox in Bangladesh (2013) Public Organization Review, 13 (4), pp. 459-476; Bouckaert, G., Van de Walle, S., Quality of public service delivery and trust in government (2003) Governing networks: EGPA yearbook, pp. 299-318. , Salminen Ari, (ed), Amsterdam, IOS Press,.

Analysis of a large household survey evaluating PS echoes findings of other studies showing that user fee removal can be highly inequitable. 34 semi-structured interviews and 19 focus group discussions with people aged 60 and over were conducted in four regions in Senegal (Dakar, Diourbel, Matam and Tambacounda) over a period of six months during 2012. They were analysed to identify underlying causes of exclusion from/inclusion in PS and triangulated with the household survey. The results point to three steps at which exclusion occurs: (i) not being informed about PS; (ii) not perceiving a need to use health services under PS; and (iii) inability to access health services under PS, despite having the information and perceived need. We identify lay explanations for exclusion at these different steps. Some lay explanations point to social exclusion, defined as unequal power relations. For example, poor access to PS was seen to be caused by corruption, patronage, poverty, lack of social support, internalised discrimination and adverse incorporation. Other lay explanations do not point to social exclusion, for example: poor implementation; inadequate funding; high population demand; incompetent bureaucracy; and PS as a favour or moral obligation to friends or family. Within a critical realist paradigm, we interpret these lay explanations as empirical evidence for the presence of the following hidden underlying causal mechanisms: lacking capabilities; mobilisation of institutional bias; and social closure. However, social constructionist perspectives lead us to critique this paradigm by drawing attention to contested health, wellbeing and corruption discourses. These differences in interpretation lead to subsequent differential policy recommendations. This demonstrates the need for the adoption of a “multi-epistemological” perspective in studies of health inequity and social exclusion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Epistemology; Inequity; Older people; Senegal; Social exclusion; Universal health coverage; User fees","accessibility; elderly population; health services; household survey; social exclusion; social inclusion; adoption; adult; attention; drawing; epistemology; friend; funding; health insurance; household; human; middle aged; morality; poverty; semi structured interview; Senegal; social exclusion; social support; wellbeing; economics; fee; female; health care cost; health care delivery; information processing; knowledge; legislation and jurisprudence; maternal health service; pregnancy; qualitative research; questionnaire; Senegal; socioeconomics; standards; statistics and numerical data; Dakar [Dakar (RGA)]; Dakar [Senegal]; Diourbel; Matam; Senegal; Tambacounda; Adult; Delivery of Health Care; Fees and Charges; Female; Focus Groups; Health Expenditures; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Knowledge; Maternal Health Services; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Qualitative Research; Senegal; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 261440","Ba, M., Dkhimi, F., Ndiaye, A., L'impact des modalités d'allocation des ressources dans les mécanismes d'exemption sur l’équité: Plan Sésame, Sénégal (2015) Afr.

This paper addresses the research question, how did the diffusion of GIS technology occur in Uganda? Mixed methods were used for data collection, and analysis was performed using a theoretical framework called the diffusion of innovations (DOI). The results of the study showed that the adoption of GIS by institutions in Uganda occurred in a classic diffusion pattern consistent with diffusion theory. Adoption of GIS was promoted by its relative advantage over, and compatibility with, existing technologies. It was characterized by both heterophilous and homophilous communication channels, and influenced by change agents and champions. Its rate of adoption followed an S-shaped diffusion curve, and was hampered by bureaucracy, and patronage-based societal norms.

Why do some politicians deliver clientelistic goods to their electoral constituencies, and why do some voters demand them? This article focuses on the historical origins of trust in states and shows that they have a lasting impact on contemporary patterns of patronage. The shift to programmatic politics reflects a historical transition from personalized trust in politicians to trust in impersonal bureaucracies tasked by political parties to implement policy. Past experience with public bureaucracy informs the expectations of voters and parties regarding the performance of the state and its ability to provide public goods, which in turn shape the degree of clientelistic exchange across societies. To capture state capacity, the authors focus on the critical juncture before the expansion of women's suffrage, and use the ability of public bureaucracies to reduce infant mortality in the interwar period as a proxy for historical state capacity and as an instrument to predict trust. Macrodata from eightyeight electoral democracies and microdata from the most recent wave of the World Value Survey provide supportive evidence for the theory.

Drawing on the frame analysis of the street-level bureaucracy and judicial ethnography, I examine the transition between two different types of judicial bureaucracy from the perspective of the actors who implemented the reform. The study is based on in-depth interviews with officials and judges of both inquisitorial and adversarial courts, administrative managers of the new courts, and actors who designed the administrative reorganization of lower criminal courts. The study involved a three-month, weekly observation in an inquisitorial court in Santiago de Chile. The article emphasizes the specificity of the Chilean judiciary, where both inquisitorial and adversarial criminal courts still coexist. © 2016 American Bar Foundation.",,,,,,,,"Alvear, S., Blanco, R., (2010) Diálogos Sobre la Reforma Procesal Penal.

These differ dramatically in how they are organized, but the underlying causal mechanisms that create and sustain them are the same. Whether they are on the top or bottom of the heap, people attempt to be superior to some other persons or group. This is the root of Melvyn L. Fein's thesis presented in Human Hierarchies: A General Theory. Fein traces the development of changes from hunter-gatherer times to our own techno-commercial society. In moving from small to large communities, humans went from face-to-face contests for superiority to more anonymous and symbolic ones. Societies evolved from hunting bands where the parties knew each other through big-men societies, chieftainships, agrarian empires, patronage chains, caste societies, estate systems, and market-oriented democracies. Where once small groupings were organized primarily by strong forces such as personal relationships, the now standard large groupings are more dependent on weaker forces such as those provided by social roles. Bureaucracies and professional roles have become prominent. Bureaucracies allow large-scale organizations to maintain control of people by limiting the potential destructiveness of unregulated tests of strength and by clarifying chains of command. Their rigidity and unresponsiveness requires that they be supplemented by professional roles. At the same time, a proliferation of self-motivated experts delegate authority downward, thereby introducing a more flexible decentralization. This analysis is a unique and significant advance in both the sociology and anthropology of stratification among humans. © 2012 by Taylor & Francis.

Since 1996 Georgia has ended tenure for new hires and for those promoted to management positions. This chapter summarizes why it may make sense to end tenure in the US civil service. Tenure was originally developed mainly to protect the civil service from the depredations of the political parties. The traditional party organization (TPO) index developed by Mayhew denotes parties with substantial autonomy, stability, hierarchy, influence over candidate nominations, and reliance on material rather than purposive (idealistic) incentives. Even in an at-will employment environment, state and local politicians will not attempt to use for patronage high-capacity public agencies; indeed, the career executives of such agencies may have the political clout to resist such demands. Reform employs three variables that involve patronage demand variables and bureaucratic capacity: Corrupt, TPO, and grade point average. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Condrey, S.E., Reinventing state civil service systems: The Georgia experience (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22 (2), p. 114; Gossett, C.W., Civil service reform: The case of Georgia (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22 (2), p. 94; Lasseter, R.W., Georgia’s merit system reform 1996–2001: An operating agency’s perspective (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22 (2), p. 125; Kellough, J.E., Nigro, L.G., Pay for performance in Georgia state government: Employee perspectives on Georgia-Gain after 5 years (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22 (2), p. 146; West, J.P., Georgia on the mind of radical civil service reformers (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22 (2), p. 79; Bowman, J.S., Gertz, M.G., Gertz, S.C., Williams, R.L., Civil service reform in Florida: Employee attitudes 1 year later (2003) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 23 (4), p. 286; Barr, S., New personnel systems have much in common (2005) Washington Post, pp. C02. , February 13; Maranto, R., Rethinking the unthinkable: Reply to Durant, Goodsell, Knott, and Murray on “A case for spoils in federal personnel management,” (1998) Administration and Society, 30 (1), p. 3; Maranto, R., Thinking the unthinkable in public administration: A case for spoils in the federal bureaucracy (1998) Administration and Society, 29 (6), p. 623; Maranto, R., Turkey farm: Why we can’t delay civil service reform (1999) Washington Monthly, p. 27; Maranto, R., Praising civil service but not bureaucracy: A brief against tenure in the U.S. civil service (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22 (3), p. 175; Maranto, R., Turkey farm: Why we can’t delay civil service reform (1999) Washington Monthly, p. 27; Maranto, R., Rethinking the unthinkable: Reply to Durant, Goodsell, Knott, and Murray on “A case for spoils in federal personnel management,” (1998) Administration and Society, 30 (1), p. 3; Maranto, R., Thinking the unthinkable in public administration: A case for spoils in the federal bureaucracy (1998) Administration and Society, 29 (6), p. 623; Van Riper, P.P., (1958) History of the United States Civil Service, , Row, Peterson, Evanston, IL; Callow, A., (1965) The Tweed Ring, , Oxford University Press, London; Van Riper, P.P., (1958) History of the United States Civil Service, , Row, Peterson, Evanston, IL; Fowler, D.G., (1943) The Cabinet Politician: The Postmasters General, 1829–1909, , Columbia University Press, New York; Maranto, R., (2005) Beyond a Government of Strangers: How Career Executives and Political Appointees Can Turn Conflict to Cooperation, , Lexington, Lanham, MD; Morone, J.A., (1998) The Democratic Wish: Popular Participation and the Limits of American Government, , Yale University Press, New Haven, CT; Weko, T.J., (1995) The Politicizing Presidency, , University Press of Kansas, Lawrence; Maranto, R., Praising civil service but not bureaucracy: A brief against tenure in the U.S. civil service (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22 (3), p. 175; Maranto, R., (2005) Beyond a Government of Strangers: How Career Executives and Political Appointees Can Turn Conflict to Cooperation, , Lexington, Lanham, MD; Harris, R.A., Milkis, S.M., (1989) The Politics of Regulatory Change, , Oxford University Press, New York; Maranto, R., (1993) Politics and Bureaucracy in the Modern Presidency: Appointees and Careerists in the Reagan Administration, , Greenwood, Westport, CT; Dionne, E.J., Jr., (1991) Why Americans Hate Politics, , Simon & Schuster, New York; Hunter, J.D., (1991) Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America, , Basic Books, New York; Uslaner, E.M., (1993) The Decline of Comity in Congress, , University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor; Brewer, G.A., Maranto, R., Comparing the roles of political appointees and career executives in the U.S. federal executive branch (2000) American Review of Public Administration, 30 (1), p. 69; Uslaner, E.M., (1993) The Decline of Comity in Congress, , University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor; Maranto, R., (2005) Beyond a Government of Strangers: How Career Executives and Political Appointees Can Turn Conflict to Cooperation, , Lexington, Lanham, MD; Ginsberg, B., Shefter, M., (2002) Politics by Other Means, , 3rd ed., Norton, New York; Mackenzie, G.C., (2001) Innocent until Nominated, , Brookings Institution, Washington, DC; Mackenzie, G.C., Hafken, M., (2002) Scandal Proof: Do Ethics Laws Make Government Ethical?

Smith brings Mexican politics and art together, chronicling the turbulent relations between radical artists and the postrevolutionary Mexican state. The revolution opened space for new political ideas, but by the late 1920s many government officials argued that consolidating the nation required coercive measures toward dissenters. While artists and intellectuals, some of them professed Communists, sought free expression in matters both artistic and political, Smith reveals how they simultaneously learned the fine art of negotiation with the increasingly authoritarian government in order to secure clout and financial patronage. But the government, Smith shows, also had reason to accommodate artists, and a surprising and volatile interdependence grew between the artists and the politicians. Involving well-known artists such as Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and David Alfaro Siqueiros, as well as some less well known, including Tina Modotti, Leopoldo Mendez, and Aurora Reyes, politicians began to appropriate the artists' nationalistic visual images as weapons in a national propaganda war. High-stakes negotiating and co-opting took place between the two camps as they sparred over the production of generally accepted notions and representations of the revolution's legacy-and what it meant to be authentically Mexican. © 2017 The University of North Carolina Press.

This assumed lack of interest, a result of equating the supposed lack of sources with the absence of practice, is based on the assumption that music making did not represent any social value for the imaginary of the privileged estate. By means of the examination of unpublished sources and a review of previous publications related to the daily life and the material culture of these urban elites, this work contributes evidence that points toward a diametrically opposed phenomenon that allows us to reconsider the role and significance that music making had for this social group.","18th century; Chamber music; Musical patronage; Nobility; Spanish America",,,,,,,"Acker, Y., (2007) Musica Y Danza en El Diario de Madrid.

Among the Madurese people, alternative channels of travelling to Mecca are increasingly popular and informal; personal networks appear to be considered more reliable and accountable than the state's guidance. The Madurese people's strong desire to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca, local conceptions of migration in search of success and incomprehensible bureaucratic procedures in the official channels of migration and pilgrimage motivate people to circumvent state structures. Moreover, rumours about the 'Madurese mafia' in Mecca and the religious elite's connections to the 'Holy Land' strengthen religious and ethnic affiliations. Local loyalties challenge the state's sovereignty over actual practices of semi-legal approaches to migration and pilgrimage. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2017.","Bureaucracy; Hajj; Madura; Merantau; Patronage; Pilgrimage management; Umrah; Undocumented migration",,,,,,"Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg: 01uc1307","Abaza, M., More on the shifting worlds of islam.

The research showed that despite the original hypothesis, civil servants have a high enough level of labor motivation on the whole, irrelatively to salaries and carrier connections. Their labor motivation is based on carrying out assigned tasks on time and widely spread practice to work overtime and on weekends and holidays. The results of research allow to distinguish such factors of labor motivation as social status, stability and reliability of the occupation, if to compare with by far higher instability of employment in private business, self-realization and deserved carrier promotion (primarily for younger respondents) as heads of departments, or connection with something great - serving for the good of the country, social (civil) service. Under-pay for employees of the lowest and middle levels brings about staff flow (instability), thus decreasing the significance of motivation. Paradoxically though, this attracts people to pubic administration for whom salary does not matter much. At the same time high motivation and work ethics do not result in effective work and performance, especially when it concerns fulfilling tasks and directives.","Motivation for public service; Motivation of civil servants; Public administration; Salary",,,,,,,"Barabashev, A.G., (2013) Evolyutsiya Gosudarstvennoi Sluzhby Rossii: Itogi Desyatiletiya (2000-2010) [Evolution of the Russian Civil Service: Results of a Decade (2000-2010)], , Moscow: HSE; Brewer, G., Selden, S., Facer, R., Individual conceptions of public service motivation (2000) Public Administration Review, 60 (3), pp. 254-264; Gimpel'Son, V.E., Magun, V.S., (2005) Na Sluzhbe Gosudarstva Rossiiskogo: Perspektivy i Ogranicheniya Kar'ery Molodykh Chinovnikov [In the Service of the Russian State: Prospects and Limitations Careers of Young Officials], , Moscow: HSE; Magomedov, K.O., The requirement for a public servant - Professionalism (2013) Gosudarstvennaya Sluzhba, (4), pp. 23-27; Nezhina, T.G., Barabashev, A.G., Serving the country or serving thyself: The quest for prosocial motives of Russian MPA students (2017) Review of Public Personnel Administration, , (accessed: 13 September, 2017); Obolonsky, A.V., Barabashev, A.G., (2009) Gosudarstvennaya Sluzhba: Kompleksnyi Podkhod [Public Service: A Comprehensive Approach], , Moscow: Delo; Obolonsky, A.V., (2011) Krizis Administrativno-byurokraticheskogo Gosudarstva.

Despite significant differences in legal culture and administrative practices, not to mention self-representation, the Russian and Ottoman empires elaborated different models of relations between subjects and rulers in an era that witnessed the emergence of national movements, colonization, and mass politics. Wheeras the Ottoman Empire in 1856 had already legally equalized all subjects before the law, and in 1869 promulgated the principle of Ottoman citizenship, the Russian Empire did not acquire universal citizenship or subjecthood until 1917. Yet, these differences notwithstanding, in both the Ottoman and Russian empires ideas and practices of citizenship and subjecthood and attempts to rationalize them faced the fundamental problem of diversity. The gradual movement toward universal citizenship/subjecthood was accompanied by the preservation and development of particularism in regard to the relationship between different groups and the state. The authors conclude that there was never a single narrative of citizenship or subjecthood and that citizenship was often a claim to the position within the polity on the side of the ruled and an idea of patronage and pedagogy of the people on the side of bureaucrats and intellectuals. © 2017, Ab Imperio.

It argues that although Velasco's tenure (1571-1591) at the Council of the Indies saw a high point in the accumulation of historiographic knowledge and information about Castile's Spanish-American possessions, the structural peculiarities of the cosmographer-chronicler's office disposed Velasco to prudently eschew writing an official history of the Indies. To appreciate and understand those peculiarities, the article focuses on three interrelated factors: The patronage networks at the royal court and their relation to monarchical bureaucracy; the Council of the Indies administrative reforms that led to the creation of the chief cosmographer-chronicler's office; and the climate of secrecy and censorship regarding knowledge of the Indies during Philip II's reign. The overarching emphasis, however, entails a consideration of the relationship between knowledge about Castile's American territories and monarchical bureaucracy, from the perspective of the Habsburg royal court in Madrid. © Academy of American Franciscan History 2016.",,,,,,,,"Ravi Munford, J., Vertical Empire: The General Resettlement of Indians in the Colonial Andes (Durham; Imprudent King: A New Life of Philip II, , Duke University Press, 2012), 77; Geoffrey Parker, New Haven/London:; (2014) Yale University Press, p. 71; Lovett, A.W., A Cardinal's Papers: The Rise of Mateo Vázquez de Leca; (1973) English Historical Review, 88 (347), pp. 241-261. , 248; Juan de Ovando, 117. , Poole José de la Peña Cámara, ""Nuevos datos sobre la visita de Juan de Ovando al; (1935) Anuario de Derecho Español, 21, pp. 425-438. , Consejo de Indias 1567-1568 436-437; (1957) Anuario de Estudios Americanos, 14, pp. 363-423. , AntonioMuro Orej ón, Las ordenanzas de 1571 del Real y Supremo Consejo de las Indias.

Patronage provides many incumbents with governability and electoral advantage. What causes governments to forsake patronage in favour of civil service reform? This article reviews scholarly explanations. It finds that studies usefully identify diverse socioeconomic and political-institutional factors which can affect reform incentives. The causal effects of these factors – their weight, mechanisms and signs – are contested, however. This article partially resolves this contestation by considering which reform studies explain: different bureaucratic structures develop asynchronously and feature different determinants. To illustrate, political competition is argued to incentivize reform to ‘blanket in’ party appointees; or do the opposite by reducing expectations to reap longer-term state capacity benefits. Yet, ‘blanketing in’ necessitates bureaucratic job stability, while state capacity requires merit recruitment of skilled bureaucrats – two poorly correlated reforms. The causes of patronage reform thus depend on the type of civil service reform. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"bureaucracy; civil service; developing world; electoral system; employment; political economy; reform process",,,,,,"Andrews, M., (2013) The Limits of Institutional Reform in Development: Changing Rules for Realistic Solutions, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Arriola, L., Patronage and Political Stability in Africa (2009) Comparative Political Studies, 42 (10), pp. 1339-1362; Asare, B., Unitarism and Presidentialism: Political Institutions and Corruption in Public Management in Ghana (2012) Journal of Public Administration and Policy Research, 4 (2), pp. 32-41; Bearfield, D., What is Patronage?

It applies a delegation theory and a Public Service Bargain perspective and argues that partisan and professional determinants influence the bureaucratic tenure. Our survival analysis shows that partisan features matter, yet differently than suggested by existing research: top officials affiliated with the minister's party have a significant higher risk of dismissal than those affiliated to other parties and non-partisans. In contrast, the temporal proximity between ministerial and top official appointments has no significant effects on bureaucratic tenure. In addition, professional determinants shape bureaucratic survival. Whereas the minister's office experience is insignificant for bureaucratic survival, the top official's office experience has significant and negative effects on the risk of dismissal: individuals with prior experience in managing bureaucratic apparatuses survive longer than those without such office experience. We conclude that German ministers are more likely to dismiss senior civil servants due to their unsatisfying office experience than their incongruent or lacking partisan affiliation. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","bureaucratic tenure; civil service; Germany; patronage; politicisation; survival analysis",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Harvard University Press Cambridge; Andeweg, R., Collegiality and collectivity: Cabinets, cabinet committees and cabinet ministers (1997) The Hollow Crown: Countervailing Trends in Core Executives, pp. 58-83. , Weller H.

This study sets out to investigate the appointment of ministerial advisers from an historical institutionalist perspective emphasizing the influence of institutional legacies on current empirical patterns. Drawing on this perspective, it identifies three patterns of institutional stability, radical, and gradual change in terms of ministerial advisers' policy competence and political loyalty, which guide the empirical analysis. Empirical patterns are illustrated with data collected in Italy, based on an analysis of a combination of career pathways and expert interviews. The Italian case is noteworthy since it experienced an abrupt party system breakdown in the early 1990s. Yet, the empirical analysis reveals that the massive re-alignment of the party system has not implied a pattern of radical change in Italy. The legacy of stable administrative structures has only left room for gradual change to occur on the dimensions of ministerial advisers' policy competence and political loyalty. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","civil service reform; Italy; ministerial cabinets; patronage; politicization",,,,,,,"Agosta, A., Piccardi, C., I gabinetti ministeriali (1988) Le Relazioni Tra Amministrazioni e Partiti, pp. 73-145. , A.

In reaching these goals, however, proponents of decentralization reform have articulated concerns about whether government officials have sufficient capacity to implement decentralization policies, particularly at local level. This article asserts that in Cambodia, where decentralization has unfolded gradually since its adoption some 15 years ago, lack of capacity is not the main problem. Decentralization is designed and implemented as part of the ruling political party's strategy to strengthen its grip at the sub-national level rather than as an exercise for improving accountability and democracy. Although decentralization is unlikely to lead to democratic gains, it does provide an opportunity for the rejuvenation of a patronage-based party in ways that could increase state capacity and improve development outcomes.

This paper argues that ethnic representation in national bureaucratic governance in the Philippines primarily constitutes a means for political reallocation of space, as it is embedded in the government’s framework of asymmetric political autonomy. Mired in intersecting political and ethnic tensions (i.e. blurred ethnic distinctions/ethnic identity disputes and politico-ethnic conflicts), patrimonial forces could easily exploit the country’s bureaucratic representation policies as spaces for patronage and as superficial tokens to mollify interethnic factions of their share of the national polity. Thus, instead of facilitating equitable voice in bureaucratic governance, such policy framework could only hold ordinary indigenous and minority ethnic communities captive in the elite-dominated interethnic struggle for representation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Asymmetric autonomy; Ethnic representation in bureaucratic governance; Political reallocation of space; Politics of ethnic representation; Representative bureaucracy","autonomy; bureaucracy; ethnic minority; ethnopolitics; indigenous population; national politics; Philippines",,,,,,"(1998) Policy on Indigenous People, , Manila: Asian Development Bank; The Indigenous Peoples and the Universal Periodic Review: A Compilation of Situationers on the IPs Human Rights (2012) Submitted to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for the Universal Periodic Review of the Philippines (2Nd Cycle), , Makati: Ateneo Human Rights Center; (2012) Indigenous Peoples and Corporate Accountability in the ASEAN: A Report of the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact, , Chiang Mai: AIPP Printing Press; Alim, G., The Bangsamoro Struggle for Self-Determination (1995) Paper Presented at the European Solidarity Conference on the Philippines – Philippine Solidarity, 2000, pp. 23-25. , In Search of New Perspectives, Hoisdorf, Germany, June; Barsh, R., (1999) The World’s Indigenous Peoples, , Maryland: First Nations0020Development Institute/First Peoples Worldwide, Calvert Group; Bruce, A., Managing Diversity (2002) Position Paper for the Training Resources to Address Equality and Diversity, , TRED) Equal Project, October; Carino, J., (2012) Country Technical Notes on Indigenous Peoples’ Issues: Republic of the Philippines, , Manila: International Fund for Agricultural Development; Curry, G., West, C., (1996) The Affirmative Action Debate, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley/Basic Books; Daes, E.-I., Standard Setting Activities: Evolution of Standards Concerning the Rights of Indigenous People - New Development and General Discussion of Future Action (1995) United Nations Commission on Human Rights, , UN Doc.

One of winning team element which have little attention from scholars is bureaucrat. Although, normatively, bureaucrats are required to neutral in all type of general election, but in fact bureaucrats is very involved deeply in general elections. Based on empirical research in Sintang District and Ketapang District, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, we found that bureaucrats have a significant role as a winning team in pilkada (direct election for local leader). Patronage is a keyword to explain political relation between bureaucrats and candidate in pilkada. This situation was triggered by the fact that there are many candidates who have social background as civil servant and, consequently, have direct access to bureaucracy. Bureaucrats have high motivation to participate in pilkada as a broker due to protecting their vested interest. In our cases, the vested interest of bureaucrat is career stability which is promising additional personal revenue and social status. Consequently, staffing (circulation of position) within bureaucracy does not followed by auction mechanism (merit system), but following nepotism mechanism (spoil system). The winner of pilkada is socially pressured to accommodate all bureaucrats who has become their winning team. Finally, we discuss our finding and propose future agenda research to understanding this phenomenon. © 2016, Asian Social Science.

It analyses the Malawian Parliament’s oversight role during the critical junctures and draws conclusions on the prospects for it to play this role more effectively. A myriad of factors impede the objectivity and efficiency of parliamentary committees in countries like Malawi, including lack of technical expertise, inadequate resources and various types of pressure from administrative officials and party leaders. The strained executive-legislature relations impeded the functioning of the legislature in many ways like curtailed sittings of Parliament, and less frequent meetings of parliamentary committees. In a political system where patronage and clientelist practices are deeply imbedded, there are an abundance of opportunities for corruption in the bureaucracy and in wider political circles. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Dan Banik and Blessings Chinsinga.",,,,,,,,"(2014) Malawi Round 6 questionnaire, , http://www.afrobarometer.org/countries/malawi/malawi-round-6-questionnaire, Available at:, (accessed 19 February 2016); (2014) Cashgate: A summary report on the fi ndings arising from work carried out into Fraud and mismanagement of Malawi Government’s Finances, , National Audit Offi ce of Malawi, 1 April-30 September 2013; Barkan, J.D., Mattes, R., Mozzafar, S., Smiddy, K., (2010) The African Legislatures Project, , 1st fi ndings, Center for Social Research, University of Cape Town; Bolarinwa, J.O., Emerging Legislatures in Africa: Challenges & Opportunities (2015) Developing County Studies, 5 (5); House, F., (2012) Countries at the Crossroads, 2012 report, , https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2012/malawi, Available at:, (accessed 19 February 2016); Gilfillan, S., (2015) Report on visit to the Malawi National Assembly, , http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/abouttheparliament/53448.aspx, Assistant Chief Executive to Scottish Parliament, 19-27 March.

In a study of patronage in the broadest sense of the term, Linda Carroll draws on vast quantities of new archival information; and by reading the previously unpublished primary sources against each other, she uncovers remarkable and heretofore unsuspected coincidences and connections. She documents the well-known links between the increasingly fruitless trade to the north and the need for new investments in land (re)gained by Venice on the mainland, links between problems of governance and political networks. She unveils the significance and potential purposes of those who invited Ruzante to perform in what are interpreted as ""rudely"" metaphorical truth-telling plays for Venetians at the highest social and political levels. Focusing on a group of patrons of art works in S. Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, the first chapter establishes their numerous interrelated commercial and political interests and connects them to the content of the works and artists chosen to execute them. The second chapter demonstrates the economic interests and related political tensions that lay behind the presence of many high-ranking government officials at a scandalous 1525 Ruzante performance. It also draws on these and materials concerning previous generations of the Beolco family and Venetian patricians to provide an entirely new picture of Beolco's relationships with his Venetian supporters. The third chapter analyzes an important Venetian literary manuscript of the period in the Bodleian Library of Oxford University whose copyist had remained unknown and whose contents have been little studied. The identity of the copyist, a central figure in the worlds of theatrical and historical and, now, literary writing in early sixteenth century Venice, is clarified and the works in the manuscript connected to the cultural worlds of Venice, Padua and Rome. © 2016 Linda L.

The data was collected using the same methodology to compare patterns of patronage within countries, across countries and across world regions that are usually studied separately. The Note addresses three research questions that are at the centre of debates on party patronage, which is understood as the power of political parties to make appointments to the public and semi-public sector: the scope of patronage, the underlying motivations and the criteria on the basis of which appointees are selected. The exploration of the dataset shows that party patronage is, to a different degree, widespread across all regions. The data further shows differences between policy areas, types of institutions such as government ministries, agencies and state-owned enterprises, and higher, middle and lower ranks of the bureaucracy. It is demonstrated that the political control of policy making and implementation is the most common motivation for making political appointments. However, in countries with a large scope of patronage, appointments serve the purpose of both political control and rewarding supporters in exchange for votes and services. Finally, the data shows that parties prefer to select appointees who are characterised by political and personal loyalty as well as professional competence. © 2016 European Consortium for Political Research.","Clientelism; Patronage; Political appointments; Political parties",,,,,,,"Andrews, M., (2013) The limits of institutional reform in development: Changing rules for realistic solutions, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bearfield, D.A., What is patronage?

This is especially important for small businesses and entrepreneurial enterprises because they lack the requisite experiential treasure trove or elaborate corporate bureaucracies to accomplish this task typically available to established large firms. In fact, textbooks on international business are full of examples of business failures when consumer proclivities have been ignored by businesses. Informed by this admonition, this manuscript seeks to investigate the psyche of Chinese and Indian consumers of a global franchise system, McDonald's. It advances the premise of cultural convergence of Chinese and Indian consumers through the lenses of organizational socialization theory. We examine whether the franchise system's universal culture and the social values of egalitarianism and democratization enshrined in the system are linked to consumers' patronage of McDonald's in the world's two largest emerging markets. Using multivariate analysis of variance, we evaluate cross-country differences in perceptions of egalitarianism and democratization as well as patronage frequency. Both country-specific effects and cross-cultural effects are discussed, and managerial implications for franchisee-entrepreneurs in each country are outlined. © 2016 International Council for Small Business.",,,,,,,,"Abrams, D., Hogg, M.A., Comments on the Motivational Status of Self-Esteem in Social Identity and Intergroup Discrimination (2006) European Journal of Social Psychology, 18 (4), pp. 317-334; Ahlstrom, D., Bruton, G.D., An Institutional Perspective on the Role of Culture in Shaping Strategic Actions by Technology-Focused Entrepreneurial Firms in China (2002) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 26, pp. 53-69; Alden, D.L., Steenkamp, J.B.E.M., Batra, R., Consumer Attitudes toward Marketplace Globalization: Structure, Antecedents, and Consequences (2006) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 23 (3), pp. 227-239; Alon, I., Global Franchising and Development in Emerging and Transitioning Markets (2004) Journal of Macromarketing, 24 (2), pp. 156-167; Amaldoss, W., Jain, S., Conspicuous Consumption and Sophisticated Thinking (2005) Management Science, 51 (10), pp. 1449-1466; Ashforth, B.E., Saks, A.M., Socialization Tactics: Longitudinal Effects on Newcomer Adjustment (1996) The Academy of Management Journal, 39 (1), pp. 149-178; Au, K., Kwan, H.K., Start-Up Capital and Chinese Entrepreneurs: The Role of Family (2009) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 33 (4), pp. 889-908; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., Phillips, L.W., Assessing Construct Validity in Organizational Research (1991) Administrative Science Quarterly, 36 (3), pp. 421-458; Bao, Y., Zhou, K.Z., Zhou, N., Social Alienation in a Transitional Economy: Antecedents and Impact on Attitude toward Social Reform (2006) Journal of Business Research, 59 (9), pp. 990-998; Bates, T., A Comparison of Franchise and Independent Small Business Survival Rates (1995) Small Business Economics, 7 (5), pp. 377-388; Baucus, D.A., Baucus, M.S., Human, S.E., Consensus in Franchise Organizations: A Cooperative Arrangement among Entrepreneurs (1996) Journal of Business Venturing, 11 (5), pp. 359-378; Belk, R.W., Tumbat, G., The Cult of Macintosh (2005) Consumption Markets & Culture, 8 (3), pp. 205-217; Bell, K.S., Randall, R.F., Williams, K., Women in Management Accounting: Determined to Succeed (1995) Management Accounting, 77 (5), pp. 20-28; Bhattacharya, C.B., Sen, S., Consumer-Company Identification: A Framework for Understanding Consumers' Relationships with Companies (2003) Journal of Marketing, 67 (2), pp. 76-88; Brislin, R.W., Back-Translation for Cross-cultural Research (1970) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 1 (3), pp. 185-216; Budhwar, P., Doing Business in India (2001) Thunderbird International Business Review, 43 (4), pp. 549-568; Calantone, R.J., Schmidt, J.B., Song, X.M., Controllable Factors of New Product Success: A Cross-national Comparison (1996) Marketing Science, 15 (4), pp. 341-358; Cayla, J., Eckhardt, G.M., Asian Brands and the Shaping of a Transnational Imagined Community (2008) Journal of Consumer Research, 35 (2), pp. 216-230; Chakrabarti, A., Cullenberg, S., (2003) Transition and Development in India, , London: Routledge Press; Chen, A., Capitalist Development, Entrepreneurial, Class, and Democratization in China (2002) Political Science Quarterly, 117 (3), pp. 401-422; Chernev, A., Hamilton, R., Gal, D., Competing for Consumer Identity: Limits to Self-Expression and the Perils of Lifestyle Branding (2011) Journal of Marketing, 75 (3), pp. 66-82; Combs, J.G., Ketchen, D.J., Jr., Short, J.C., Franchising Research: Major Milestones, New Directions, and Its Future within Entrepreneurship (2011) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 35 (3), pp. 413-425; Cui, G., Liu, Q., Emerging Market Segments in a Transitional Economy: A Study of Urban Consumers in China (2001) Journal of International Marketing, 9 (1), pp. 84-106; Dana, L.P., Kentucky Fried Chicken (1999) British Food Journal, 101 (5-6), pp. 493-495; Dana, L.P., McDonald's Co.

Reacting to a rapid development of state employment, critics saw colonial expansion as a spillover effect of metropolitan administrative hypertrophy. Indochina was singled out in particular as a ""colony of functionaries,"" serving more as a job creation program for French ""déclassés"" than as a beacon of French grandeur. Criticism centered on the filling of government positions through political patronage, a system at which Indochina excelled. The state employee majority among the colony's French population likewise produced political distortions that cemented Indochina's reputation for bureaucratic excess and motivated reform efforts for decades. The well-known ascendancy of association policy in this period, which focused on Indochina, was primarily driven by the conflation of assimilation and direct administration with fonctionnarisme. Antibureaucratic ideology thus came to constitute an influential force shaping French politics in both metropole and empire.

In addition to questions of social (and geographical) mobility, the authors discuss the connections between service, economic entrepreneurship, personalized authority relationships, networks of patronage and protection, the salience of local conditions and relationships (and how they related to the center), the development of the Muscovite bureaucracy (especially questions of professionalization and the relationship between provincial and Moscow service), administrative effectiveness and corruption, and finally the ongoing motif of regular government. On the whole, the reader will see how an ambitious family navigated the “system,” what they did to survive and thrive, how they struggled, how social mobility more broadly could be achieved, how crucial economic success was to success in service and to the process of ennoblement, and how servitors experienced the Table of Ranks and other Petrine reforms. The authors show that upward mobility did not depend entirely on statist or tsarist mechanisms. By highlighting the multiple mechanisms and pathways to mobility that the Shagarovs worked and experienced, this article demonstrates how individuals and/or families (in this case family solidarity was a critical factor in success) could take charge of their own future and take advantage of the changing conditions and opportunities that arose. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Despite all the international undertakings, some 2.1 billion people (i.e. around 30 per cent of the world’s population) drink “dangerous” water that presents health risks.1 In consequence, managing to supply everyone with this essential good is not just a matter of friendly discussion between specialists, but challenges the foundations of collective action and water policies. How do we explain why, in a world where billions of dollars are invested in the entertainment or armament industries, it is not possible to develop (and finance) programmes that will bring improvements to countries where this essential good is lacking? A central hypothesis of this book is that in order to understand the problems of the water sector, the obstacles preventing its proper functioning and the inequalities that arise from them, we need to move away from debates about the legal status of the water operators - public versus private - and consider their actual practices. What do the protagonists of the water sector actually do? What actions do they undertake? Under what institutional arrangements? Both economic history and research on firms show that some companies are driven by profit, but others innovate and bring progress for a “fair” return. There may be public bureaucracies overstaffed due to patronage and clientilist practices, but also public enterprises that are competent and efficient. Ultimately, the results are explained by internal properties (professionalism) and the capacity of the protagonists to establish institutions that provide incentives and points of equilibrium between the interests concerned. In other words, one needs to focus on the practices, the frameworks in which they are embedded and the conditions of their implementation. In order to develop this line of research, we begin with two cases which, in many respects, stand at the antipodes of economic doxa: the Chongqing joint venture and the Salt River Project in Arizona. In China, the sector remains dominated by public operators, whereas in the USA one expects to find private companies; and yet both of these cases are structured around partnerships between public and private actors. The book then goes on to present four cases which, in different ways, are seen as exemplars of the theme of public-private conflict (Buenos-Aires, Paris, Berlin, Nagpur), but which prove to be much more complex in their logic. A final section is dedicated to small technical systems and to the conditions under which they develop. The aim is to see, on the one hand, what they contribute that the existing system was unable to do, and on the other, whether they offer lasting solutions. The cases studied teach us that, for progress to take place, the right skills need to be available. Although the water sector is not one of the new technological industries, it demands expertise at multiple levels, even in small decentralized systems, and the responses provided make all the difference after a few years. The overstaffing in Buenos Aires’ public company or, conversely, the results of the La Paz-El Alto cooperatives or of the small technical systems in Maputo and Ouagadougou are testament to this often forgotten factor. However, for operators - whether public or private - to be able to apply their skills, they need a legal framework and a minimum level of trust, so that they can tackle the problems and adapt their policies to the context; the urban environments in which they operate are always characterized by change, be it in demographics, the economic base or spatial characteristics. The difficulty of the exercise, moreover, is that it takes place in a situation of monopoly, which reinforces the asymmetry in the skills between firms and municipal authorities. Unless it is assumed that the operators are naturally virtuous, trust - which is necessary to action - has to be managed. This problem of rules or the regulation of the relations between public authorities and operators is at the heart of performance. The balance sought is fragile: an insufficiency of rules can encourage opportunistic behaviour, while too many can hamper action and lead to crises. This chapter will present three main outcomes of the combinatory perspective developed throughout the case studies. First, the articulation between these different factors contributes to the development of water policies and the approaches employed by operators - what we refer to as “water regimes”. Second, it sheds light on the origins and characteristics of controversies and conflicts about water; while it is true that culture (or informal institutions) explains a great deal in terms of the spontaneous acceptance or rejection of various systems, it is equally important to deconstruct institutions in order to reveal “second-rank institutions” that explain the evolution of controversies: the role of contracts, calculation mechanisms, types of report; spheres of expression, coalitions. Third, with regard to the much-discussed subject of the possible “pathways to progress” for developing countries and the choice between large and small technical systems, the cases studied cover a wide range of context-dependent solutions. © 2016 Dominique Lorrain and Franck Poupeau, selection and editorial matter; individual chapters, the authors.",,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,,,,,9781317211921; 9781138668201,,,"English","Water Regimes: Beyond the public and private sector debate",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104167325

This article aims to shed light on this issue. By examining the social demographics of political elites in Russia's multi-ethnic regions and major trends in their evolution, we argue that social background can be accepted as the key indicator for such analysis. We provide extensive data on how it influences the process of shaping the elites and the work of those who belong to this social group. Our study is based on comprehensive empirical research of political elites we conducted in Buryatia, Sakha (Yakutia) and Tuva in 2004-2010. During the Soviet period, the political elites, due to the ideology of the cadre policy, were primarily of proletarian or peasant background. In the postSoviet period, as attested by numerous researchers, the share of people with such backgrounds has significantly decreased. The current elites of Buryatia, Sakha (Yakutia) and Tuva are largely the descendants of intelligentsia and civil servants and are closely linked by birth to their regions. A large part of these elites were born in the countryside. The current system of recruitment and promotion of government officials, like the Soviet one, places crucial emphasis on informal selection mechanisms, including such factors as social background, kinship, territorial community, personal loyalty, patronage, etc. This is also indicated by the survey of the members of political elites of the three regions. Our study has shown that career promotion is heavily influenced by the experience of working side-by-side with the region's 'first persons', personal loyalty, patronage, kinship or 'homeboy' networks. © 2016 New Reaearch of Tuva.

We passed concrete and plywood homes and small shops, while navigating around livestock and the deteriorating open drains that bisect many of the walkways. There are only a few roads in the community that are large enough for vehicles, so residents generally travel by way of the labyrinth of paths that wind through the densely populated neighbourhoods. Nima and Maamobi, although not officially separate municipalities, joined together to become a self-designated human rights city. In addition to their status as a human rights city, the two neighbourhoods are united by the fact that they are often perceived by outsiders as being distinct from the surrounding city. In contrast to the rest of Accra, which is largely Christian and relatively wealthy, Nima and Maamobi have a large Islamic population and many residents are significantly poorer than other Accra residents. The neighbourhoods of Nima and Maamobi are unplanned and have long carried the reputation of being migrant communities. In 1973, Grindal estimated that 90 per cent of the communities’ population ‘is ethnically non-indigenous, consisting of northern tribesmen and a significantly large proportion of non-Ghanaians from northern Togo and Upper Volta’ (1973: 335). Some residents feel that the ethnic, religious, and economic diversity of the area has led them to be treated by policy makers as non-indigenous and transitory, and therefore less worthy of much-needed development funds. In this chapter, I argue that the status of the Nima and Maamobi human rights city (as a ‘city within a city’ (White 2011: 275)) poses unique challenges for local human rights activists. One of the primary challenges faced by local activists is how to pursue large-scale community development projects using the human rights framework rather than the system of political patronage, which is prevalent in Ghana. Although common across Ghana (Hasty 2005; Lentz 1998; Nugent 1995), strong patronage relationships are particularly prevalent in unplanned communities where residents often find difficulty accessing things like employment, credit, and government officials (Fox 2014). © Cambridge University Press 2016.

The backwardness of Mexico’s education sector has persisted into the twenty-first century. Public education has exhibited a jarring lack of transparency as monitoring and evaluation systems have, at least until recently, been extremely weak. The sector has displayed major teacher payroll irregularities, chronic teacher absenteeism, and patronage-based practices in teacher hiring and management. In 2014, The Economist reported that 13 percent of the teacher payroll - or 298, 000 teachers - did not show up for work. In the state of Nayarit, a local boss of the teachers” union and his family members simultaneously held positions as salaried classroom teachers, school principals, and district supervisors - and enjoyed a sizable income stream - without performing any of the duties that these positions entailed (del Valle 2014c). These types of practices have contributed to the low quality of public schools. National and international standardized tests show that Mexican public school students have not learned basic skills in reading, math, and science. Mexico had the lowest average score of all OECD countries in those subjects on the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). While socio-economic status heavily influenced these results (OECD 2013), the politicization of schools has surely also impacted achievement. The political clout of the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE) helps to account for the backwardness of public education and the inability of governments to enact significant changes in policy. Since the union was founded in 1943, SNTE has incrementally expanded its patrimonial power over the public school system. According to Max Weber, patrimonial power is a traditional form of domination in which a leader, who is not constrained by legal-rational rules, uses his or her official power to serve personal ends (Weber 1968). Embodying the concept of patrimonialism, union leaders exerted influence over the appointment of high-level officials in the education bureaucracy, placed union loyalists in significant administrative positions in schools, and influenced teacher hiring and promotion up the salary scale. Only in 2013, after the implementation of landmark education laws that reasserted the state’s authority over the education sector, were there signs that the union’s political power may have reached its limits. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,,,,,,"Hernández, A., Carlos, J., La Alianza por la Calidad de la Educación: Modernización de los Centros Escolares y Profesionalización de los Maestros (2009) Centro de Estudios Sociales y de Opinión Pública., , Documento de Trabajo Núm. 74; Arnaut, A., La Federalización de la Educación Básica y Normal (1978-1994) (1994) Política y Gobierno, 1 (2), pp. 237-274; Baranda, A., Acusan Alteración de la Ley Educativa (2014) Reforma, , April 16; Barrera, I., Myers, R., (2011) Estándares y Evaluación Docente en México: El Estado del Debate, , Serie Documentos No. 59.

First of all, the suffrage is contemplated as a mercantilist element. That is, as a good of exchange used by some civil servants and ambitious men to be successful in the administration or in personal businesses. This behaviour reveals a practice of the vote usually guided by patronage. Secondly, this analysis addresses other factors, which were also relevant in the emission of the suffrage in the lower House. The political representative considered electorate's interests, he was constrained by political parties' influence and he also valued ideology in his decisions. This approach introduces parliamentary dynamics not only ruled by patronage, but also regulated by a multiplicity of factors, which made liberal politics a more complex reality than the one represented by a particular profit.","Liberalism; Political Parties-Member of Parliament; Spanish Parliament; Vote",,,,,,,"Santirso, M., (2008) Progreso y Libertad: España en la Europa Liberal, 1830-1870, , Ariel, Barcelona; Presno Linera, M.A., (2013) Leyes y Normas Electorales en la Historia Constitucional Española, , Iustel, Madrid; Estrada Sánchez, M., (1999) El Significado Político de la Legislación Electoral en la España de Isabel II, , Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Cantabria, Santander; Fernández Domínguez, A., (1992) Leyes Electorales Españolas de Diputados a Cortes en el Siglo XIX: Estudio Histórico y Jurídico-político, , Civitas, Madrid; Moreno Luzón, J., Teoría del clientelismo y estudio de la política caciquil (1995) Revista de Estudios Políticos, 89, pp. 191-224; Clapham, C., (1982) Private Patronage and Public Power: Political Clientelism in the Modern State, , Francis Pinter, London; Peyrou, F., (2006) La Comunidad de Ciudadanos: El Discurso Democrático-Republicano en España, 1840-1868, , Edizioni Plus-Pisa University Press, Pisa; Carasa, P., (1997) Élites Castellanas de la Restauración: Una Aproximación al Poder Político en Castilla, 2, p. 14. , Junta de Castilla y León/Consejería de Educación y Cultura, Salamanca; Inarejos Muñoz, J.A., (2008) Ciudadanos, Propietarios y Electores en la Construcción del Liberalismo Español: El Caso de Las Provincias Castellano-manchegas (1854-1868), , Biblioteca Nueva, Madrid; Pons Altés, J.M., (2002) Moderats i Progressistes a la Lleida del Segle XIX (1843-1868), , Pagès, Lleida; Díaz Marín, P., (1998) Después de la Revolución: Centralismo y Burguesía en Alicante, 1844-1854, , Generalitat Valenciana/Instituto de Cultura Juan Gil-Albert, Valencia/Alicante; Cabrera, M.A., La investigación y el concepto de cultura política (2010) Culturas Políticas: Teoría e Historia, pp. 20-21. , M.

Baca as sheriff of Los Angeles County, comparing and contrasting his leadership, ensconced in new age terminology, with that of his predecessors, Sherman Block and Peter J. Pitchess. Of immediate concern were his personal decisions, in particular the appointment of Paul Tanaka to be his under sheriff after many years serving as his campaign treasurer. What was considered a marginally functional merit-based promotional system was transformed into a political patronage model, with the attendant loss of organizational legitimacy and tarnished public reputation. The chapter will compare and contrast life within the ""car as the term is commonly used within the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and life outside the car, through first-hand accounts, testimony from the Citizen's Commission on Jail Violence, depositions, and published reports. Using the concept of representative bureaucracy, I will track organizational diversity as a performance measure using the relative inclusion of all employee groups in the rank structure of the department and how each group fared under the Baca/Tanaka administration. In conclusion, this chapter will present different coping mechanisms utilized by employees confronting serious corruption issues that impacted them directly, and indirectly through the organization.

Mickevičiaus g. 37, Kaunas, LT-44240, Lithuania","The paper focuses on the conceptualization of party patronage. The analysis of the usage of the term party patronage reveals several challenges: scholars from different fields use different definitions of party patronage, in addition same phenomena can be described by different concepts making it difficult to compare data from different surveys or analysis. Furthermore the term itself must be revised continuously as it can become out dated due to changing aspects of party patronage in modern world. To clarify the usage of term party patronage it is important to define contiguous phenomenon such as clientelism, politicization, state capture, pork barrel and corruption. Hence this paper suggests slightly modified conceptualization used by Kopecky et al.: party patronage as power of political parties to make personnel decisions in the public sector for Lithuanian social sciences. Party patronage is defined by three dimensions: who makes the decision, what are the decisions and where those decisions are made? In case of party patronage political parties acts as collective patrons and they make decisions of the personnel matter (hiring, promoting and transferring of public servants) in public sector. This conceptualization enables to show differences between party patronage and contiguous phenomenon. In short clientelism should be understood as an electoral resource of the political party, while party patronage should be understood as an organizational and governmental resource. Concept of politicization is closely connected to party patronage, however politicization is more suitable for public administrative studies as it is directed to the separation of bureaucrats and politicians while party patronage in political science puts attention on the political power of parties to make personal decisions. State capture is defined as systematic influence of business to government in order to obtain favorable legal and regulatory decisions. Pork barrel politics means direction of funding and legislation towards certain constituency or geographical region. Corruption should be understood as abuse of authority and power for personal gain.","Clientelism; Conceptualization; Party patronage; Politicization; Pork barrel.; State capture",,,,,,,"Aceituno-Montes, J.M., Robles-Egea, A., (2011) An Impossible Democracy Political Clientelism and Corruption in Andalusia, , ECPR General Conference.

However, patronage has been conventionally associated with the distribution of jobs in public administration aiming to reward services rendered to the party in government. This is not entirely satisfactory. The growing complexity of governance processes, together with the growing influence of the upper echelons of the civil service in policy making has prompted politicians to search for new ways of controlling the bureaucracy.

There was a strict jury to select from the submitted works and to recommend what to exhibit and what to buy. The Spring Exhibition opened on 20 April 1957 in all rooms of the Kunsthalle was different. The exhibits were not selected by a state-delegated jury but by four juries delegated by the artists themselves and everyone was free to submit their painting, sculpture, print to any of the four.The selection was also widely different from the 'socialist realist' works of the earlier spring exhibitions, representing a rich assortment of styles from naturalist to abstract and surrealist. The Greek sculptor Agamemnon Macris, who immigrated to Hungary and was immediately accepted and acknowledged by the art community, was entrusted with the organization of the exhibition; he arranged the selection by stylistic trends, each given a room of its own. The Spring Exhibition was received by a meticulously organized volley of criticism. It was reviled by the dailies and - under the pretext of a debate - the newly launched literary weekly, Élet és Irodalom [Life and Literature] carried a series of disparaging articles.It was their coordinated opinion that under the motto ""let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools compete"" the Spring Exhibition was a misinterpreted copy of the ongoing Chinese cultural campaign and, in short, it was petty bourgeois anarchy incarnate.The experience of a free choice of style, unrestricted self-presentation and the intensive attack of abuse left a deep imprint on the memory of the artists.The same applies to art historical writing. The author is a researcher of the history of the Fine Arts (from 1968 Arts) Fund. In the four decades of socialism this institution was in charge of organizing the subsistence of artists: the companies under its aegis did everything from casting sculptures to art trade, from grounding canvas to printing picture-postcards, and from the income the fund gave the artists old-age pension, medical care, sick pay and occasional allowances, and even interest-free loans. Several documents have been found scattered among the files of the Federation of Hungarian Artists and the Ministry of Culture found in the National Archives, which refer to the 1957 Exhibition. Excerpts are given from them in the Appendix. The picture that they help reproduce provides explanation to the nervousness with which the political leadership that rose to power with the support of the intervening Soviet troops after the 1956 revolution responded to the Spring Exhibition. The documents reveal: the Spring Exhibition was not only an attempt to restore the artists' intellectual autonomy, but also - and most importantly - to regain their financial independence. The four juries were also the cores of four possible artists' groups, and the members of the Artists' Federation and the Arts Fund would have been rallied in the ""salons"" they represented.Each of these salons would have owned a company which they hoped to set up on the material and personal resources of the art trading company of the Fund called Képcsarnok, and of the creative communities active with permission since the autumn of 1953. Splitting up Képcsarnok into smaller companies was originally proposed by the Arts Fund director and the leaders of the art division of the Ministry of Education in summer 1956 and not by the Federation. It was hoped that when a single company was replaced by several, and each management included a few prominent artists, then the grumbling painters and graphic artists protesting against the hegemony of the only art trading company's only jury and the only top leader of the jury could be pacified. The director's plan was discussed by the artists several times in summer and autumn, but then the revolution broke out on the 23rd, veering the story into a new direction. The Executive Committee formed from the Revolutionary Committee of the Federation of Artists and the ministerial commissioner Agamemnon Macris who headed the Federation put the plan in the focus of the reform of the Federation they jointly worked out. The four economic units called ""salons"" converted from the planned four small companies would have been held together by a new independent Artists' Federation Association shedding the patronage of the state. The membership of the ""salons"", with their leadership of prominent artists and juries answerable to them, and with the Arts Fund to be put under their control, wished to take their own destiny in hand, eliminating the so-far dictating bureaucratic apparatus: the party centre and the ministry. The Spring Exhibition would have been the debut of this reorganized Association and the enterprises that would have ensured its financial autonomy. No doubt about it, this could not be put up with either by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party or the government officials. The Kádárian leadership driven by the logic of the violent recapture of power refused to yield the safest means of control: the material resources and supervision of the access to them. Consequently, it deployed all possible means to checkmate the artists' plan. In the forums of publicity the pluralism of the Spring Exhibition was vehemently attacked, while the office took ""administrative"" measures to thwart the working of the Association trying to reorganize itself in a new spirit and on new grounds.It was therefore in vain for Macris to visit György Aczél, the newly appointed deputy cultural minister to tell him his assessment of the situation and to advise on it, for no one listened to him. The working of the Association was suspected, the reform plans discarded and they tried to erase even the memory of the Spring Exhibition.","Agamemnon macris; Artists federation; Arts fund; György Aczél; Nóra Aradi; Spring exhibition; Style pluralism",,,,,,,"György, H., A Müvészek Bevonulása.

In the last three years, possibly even since the passage of India’s Right to Information Act of 2005, anti-corruption has had an unrivalled appeal across the political spectrum, and nearly everyone has wanted a piece of it. The Congress-led anti-corruption reports argued that the colonial bureaucracy therefore had mapped onto a range of traditional relationships that failed to embrace the ‘modern’ principles of governance being espoused by the ruling regime. The notion of corruption as a decline in political morality then, also appeals to parties who have sought to revive the moral impulses of ŉational’ unity. Anti-corruption movements and public discussion about corruption, for example, are naturally more common around times of electoral contest. © 2016, 2018 selection and editorial matter, Knut A.

Yet was this sufficient to bringing the demanded change and meeting people’s expectations? In several Arab countries, citizens are offered patronage through public sector employment, subsidies, and limited taxation (Razzaz and Razzaz, 2012). The social contract imbalance offers little support to citizen voice and representation of all segments of society in holding governments accountable. Given the numerous challenges ranging from an overinflated bureaucracy resulting from the guaranteed employment since Nasser’s era, to the declining quality of the available pool of workers and to regulations that hinder its development, capacity building of would pose as one of the least costly areas of potential quick reform (Beissinger et al, 2013; El Baradei and Newcomer, 2008; ETF, 2011; Radwan, 2012; World Bank, 2013). Public management literature implies that a political will and government-endorsed reforms tend to have a higher rate of success (Meyer-Sahling 2011; Nakroŝis, 2014). This reflects on the organizational willingness and commitment to training and training transfer (Lim and Morris, 2006; Nakroŝis, 2014). Based on previous research in the field that links institutional enabling factors and a committed political will to effective capacity building (Adetunji, 2012; Lim and Morris, 2006; Majeed, 2010; Meyer-Sahling 2011; Nakroŝis, 2014; Newcomer et al., 2010; OECD, 1997, Rondineli, 2004) this research will examine the institutional challenges to capacity building in Egypt post the Arab Spring. The methodology utilized depends on a literature review of primary and secondary sources for grounded theory qualitative research on capacity building and institutional enabling factors. The findings are linked to a qualitative analysis to probe the perceptions of public service mid-career managerial level professionals and to identify their perceived expectations of whether training institutions would be effective in transforming public service. Managerial levels were selected to enable probing the commitment of institutions. Two empirical tools were utilized: interviews and surveys. The first tool was a number of in-depth face-to-face structured interviews conducted with 24 informed sources representing senior managerial level public service managers. The second tool was a survey which was distributed both online and in hard copy. The survey targeted a purposive sample of 350 mid-managerial level public service managers of which 324 were received. Thus, exceeding the critical sample size of 200 identified by Joseph Hair and his colleagues (1998) in deciding about the sufficient sample size for empirical research. Data collection took a total of seven months, from June to December 2013, and was approved by the American University in Cairo Institutional Review Board. © The Author(s) 2014.","Capacity building; Egypt; Institutional challenges; Managers; Public service",,,,,,,"Adetunji, J., Civil service training strategy cuts '‘massive duplication’' (2012) The Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/blog/2012/jun/29/central-government-civil-service, 29 June.

Political influence can harm competence because it lowers the incentives of bureaucrats to invest in competence. Politicians then want to adopt institutions that insulate the bureaucracy because this establishes a commitment to reward competence. Political leaders insulate the bureaucracy if public good provision is important compared to rent extraction or when political competition forces the political elite to internalize the welfare loss caused by patronage. Through this channel political reforms can lead to reforms of the bureaucracy. The theoretical findings are illustrated with existing empirical studies and data on central bank independence. © by De Gruyter 2015.","bureaucracy; competence; insulation; patronage; political institutions; rent extraction",,,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Ticchi, D., Vindigni, A., Emergence and persistence of inefficient states (2010) Journal of the European Economic Association, 9, pp. 177-369; Acemoglu, D., (2005) Constitutions, Politics and Economics: A Review Essay on Persson and Tabellini's the Economic Effect of Constitutions, , NBER Working Paper, 11235; Aghion, P., Tirole, J., Formal and real authority in organizations (1997) Journal of Political Economy, 105, pp. 1-29; Alesina, A., Baqir, R., Easterly, W., Public goods and ethnic divisions (1999) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114, pp. 1243-1284; Alesina, A., Tabellini, G., Bureaucrats or politicians?

However, institutional barriers - such as the requirement for legislative confirmation - exist that may make pursuing a strategy of responsive competence difficult, if not impossible. Here, I examine a model of bureaucratic appointments that allows for informationally imperfect agencies. I show that when legislative assent is required, trade-offs between ideology and either patronage or agency performance - or both - are often required to ensure legislative confirmation. The same dynamics are not present for unilateral appointments. Finally, using a data set that incorporates the ideologies of federal program managers, the performance of federal programs, and whether program managers were patronage appointees, I conduct a series of empirical tests that support the model's predictions. © 2014 The Author.

As such, it is commonly seen as an obstacle to (or as a stopgap for) effective administration; as a feature that is in some respects compatible with (and may aid) democracy; and as behaviour that is quite simply different from practice within Weberian bureaucracies. I wish to point this debate along a slightly different path. I suggest that a more nuanced approach (and one closer to everyday experience) is yielded when patronage is recognized as an aspect of social relationships. Viewed in this light, there is more than enough material in the existing literature to reveal a link between patronage, formal organizations and democracy. I then go on to discuss briefly why relationships modulate such that certain aspects are brought to the fore; and to consider the implications of this explanation for existing views on patronage and the genesis of organizations and democratic patterns. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Corrruption; Democracy; Government; Organizations; Patronage; Social relationships",,,,,,,,,,"Springer New York LLC",,,,,01472011,,,,"English","Society",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939994423

Such states often continue failing because of the very presence of mafias and their collusion with politicians and civil servants. This happened in western Sicily in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with the development of a modern market economy that was left without protection and created a demand for alternative protection. Men skilled in the use of violence and loosely organized in autonomous, informal, local groups, called mafias, enforced alternative, nonstate (""criminal"") protection. Following the abolition of feudalism and the confiscation of church domains, vast landed estates (latifundia) came up for sale. The reforms increased the number of absentee landlords and widened the gaps between them and the peasants left without compensation for the lost user rights on the estates. Mafiosi operated as powerbrokers between absentee landlords and a growing peasant proletariat. The expansion of the suffrage in the twentieth century reinforced existing power relations based on patronage. Once more, a democratic innovation favored mafia structures, organized as political machines to gather votes and keeping at bay a barely controlled class war. Mafia presence was particularly strong in western Sicily: in and around Palermo and in its vast and desolate hinterland of large cereal-pasture holdings and isolated agro-towns on hilltops that separated the peasants from the land. The near absence of mafia in the eastern part of Sicily coincides with a less colonial and a less ""feudal"" past, resulting in a more equal distribution of land, more intensive and diversified cultivation patterns, an advanced infrastructure, and more democratic institutions, similar to areas in the northern parts of Italy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This article examines the impact of these initiatives and demonstrates that participatory local governance faces a number of challenges in Bangladesh, in particular, absence of democratic culture and tradition and disengagement of citizens, asymmetric distribution of patronage and weak institutions. In theory, political elites and bureaucrats in Bangladesh advocate democracy, accountability and local-level participation, but in practice, they have an affinity for power and centralised authority. Their reform initiatives seem half-hearted and disjointed restricting the growth of democratic culture and participatory local governance at the local level in Bangladesh. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Bangladesh; Governance; government; local; participatory",,,,,,,"(2004), http://www.developmentfunds.org/pubs/UNCDF_Bangladesh.pdf; Akkerman, T., Political responsiveness and public participation (2003) Public participation and local governance, pp. 85-102. , Font J., (ed), Barcelona: Institut de Ciencies Politiques i Socials; Alam, Q., Teicher, J., The state of governance in Bangladesh: the capture of state institutions (2012) South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies, 35 (4), pp. 858-884; (2007) Statistical yearbook of Bangladesh 2006, , Dhaka: Ministry of Planning, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh; Beynon-Davies, P., Models for e-government (2007) Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 1 (1), pp. 7-28; Bingham, L.B., Nabatchi, T., O’Leary, R., The new governance: practices and processes for stakeholder and citizen participation in the work of government (2005) Public Administration Review, 65 (5), pp. 547-558; Blair, H., Participation and accountability at the periphery: democratic local governance in six countries (2000) World Development, 28 (1), pp. 21-39; Brett, E.A., Participation and accountability in development management (2003) Journal of Development Studies, 40 (2), pp. 1-29; Chandler, J., A rationale for local government (2010) Local Government Studies, 36 (1), pp. 5-20; Cole, R.L., Caputo, D.A., The public hearing as an effective citizen participation mechanism: a case study of the general revenue sharing program (1984) The American Political Science Review, 78 (2), pp. 404-416; Cooper, T.L., Bryer, T.A., Meek, J.W., Citizen-centered collaborative public management (2006) Public Administration Review, 66 (s1), pp. 76-88; Cornwall, A., Spaces for transformation?

What, therefore, explains the adoption of non-prison sentences across the region? Using Brazil as a case study, this article claims that sentencing reform is a consequence of the growing autonomy of bureaucrats who manage the criminal justice system. Insulated from patronage networks and granted broad mandates to pursue solutions to pressing penal crises, these policy elites use their position in the state to develop new rules and facilitate their approval despite popular opposition to measures that limit the state's punitive capacity. The findings point to the importance of bureaucratic autonomy for the enactment of policies that can benefit the underprivileged but do not enjoy widespread support from voters.

Between 1250 and 1500, western Europe witnessed the birth and coming of age of diplomatic, military, financial, navigational, technological, devotional, artistic, and educational practices that were to mold and shape the early modern world. We cannot, I would contend, understand the Renaissance world without some awareness and appreciation of what preceded it. Knowledge of the later Middle Ages – an allegedly epidemic-wracked, war-torn, and strife-ridden epoch – is vital to our understanding of Renaissance culture because it offers us striking visual evidence of a novel kind. For the first time since the end of the Roman Empire, images that look as if they represent the features of living individuals appear in western art. As ever, sculpture had led the way towards verisimilitude during the thirteenth century – in the West Choir of Naumburg cathedral (c. 1240-50) and in the works of the brothers Pisano (1258-1319). But it is only in the early fourteenth century that recognizable, identifiable portraits begin to emerge, first of all in devotional art, namely in wall paintings, altarpieces, and Books of Hours. Much of this artistic patronage stemmed from the very highest echelons of society, although it was not entirely confined to them. Much of it was associated with the courts of rulers. The princely households of the later Middle Ages formed, at the very least, the seedbed from which the courts of the Renaissance were to grow. Courts, great and small, were populated by highstatus patrons, clerical and secular, drawn from the ranks of both hereditary and more recent nobility, and from the growing legal and financial bureaucracies of the age. As power centers, filling the space around the person of the prince, the courts of Europe acted as forums of many kinds, above all as a means whereby images of rulers and their immediate entourages were presented. In the iconography of power, the court played a fundamental role. It is the purpose of this chapter to trace some of these developments into the Renaissance and to consider the legacy of later medieval civilization and its princely courts to the world of humanism, individualism, princely power, and the “new” monarchies of the sixteenth century. © 2007 Selection and editorial matter, John Jeffries Martin; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,"Adamson, J., (1999) The Princely Courts of Europe: Ritual, Politics and Culture under the Ancien Régime, 1500–1750, , London; Armstrong, C.A.J., The Golden Age of Burgundy: Dukes that Outdid Kings (1977) The Courts of Europe.

As a bureaucrat and historian of Iranian provenance, he lived in a very turbulent period of the Ottoman-Aqquyunlu, Ottoman-Mamluk and Ottoman-Safavid rivalry [rivalries] at the end of the 15th century and at the beginning of the 16th century. He established relationships at different times with each of these four dynasties which were hostile to each other. Although he is remembered for being under the patronage of Bayezid II and Selim I, in fact he attempted to seek patronage of different dynasties in this political atmosphere. No doubt one of the potential patrons was Shah Ismail. In the light of a recently discovered document this article discusses Bidlîsî’s aim to find a new patron in the person of the Shah, an idea he conceived in Istanbul after leaving Bayezid II’s patronage, during his sojourn in Mecca where he travelled for realizing this aim. © 2015, ISAM, Turkish Religious Foundation Centre for Islamic Studies.

The declining quality of the Australian 'political class' is a major factor underlying the decline in public trust and confidence in federal parliamentarians. Major parties in Australia are weakened by voter-party dealignment, factional divisions, falling trust and declining membership. They gradually abandon the systematic recruitment and grooming of leaders, attempting instead to pick emerging leaders and vote winners: factional loyalists, media celebrities, and skillful party functionaries. This trend is aggravated by relentless media exposés that undermine the system of political recruitment by skewing it towards the selection of party bureaucrats, demagogues, celebrities and PR experts. © Jan Pakulski and Bruce Tranter, 2015.",,,,,,,,"Adorno, T.W., Frenkel-Brunswik, E., Levinson, D.J., Sanford, R.N., (1950) The Authoritarian Personality, , New York: Harper & Row; Aldrich, J.H., Rational choice and turnout (1993) American Journal of Political Science, 37 (1), pp. 246-278; Alford, D., Alford, L., (1959) The Case of the Sleeping People: Finally Awakened by Little Rock School Frustrations, , Little Rock, AR: The Alfords; Allport, G., (1958) The Nature of Prejudice, , New York: Doubleday, Anchor; Anderson, K., The little rock school desegregation crisis: Moderation and social conflict (2004) The Journal of Southern History, 70, pp. 603-636; Anderson, K., (2010) Little Rock: Race and Resistance at Central High School, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Arendt, H., Reflections on little rock (1959) Dissent, 6 (1), pp. 45-56; Gazette, A., (1959) Crisis in The South: The Little Rock Story, , Little Rock, AR: Arkansas Gazette; Avery, J.M., The sources and consequences of political mistrust among african americans (2006) American Politics Research, 34 (5), pp. 653-682; Baldwin, J., (1993) Nobody Knows My Name, p. 1961. , New York: Vintage; Baldwin, J., (1963) The Fire Next Time, , New York: Dial; Bartley, N.V., Looking back at little rock (1966) Arkansas Historical Quarterly, 25, pp. 47-54; Bartley, N.V., (1969) The Rise of Massive Resistance: Race and Politics in the South during the 1950’s, , Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press; Bartley, N.V., Interposition, moderation, and the federal government (1995) The New South: 1945-1980, 11, pp. 223-260. , A History of the South.

In a masterful reconceptualization of the functioning of empire, Erik Lars Myrup’s Power and Corruption in the Early Modern Portuguese World argues that beneath the surface of formal government, an intricate web of interpersonal relationships played a key role in binding together the Portuguese empire. Myrup draws on archival research in Portugal, Spain, Brazil, and China to demonstrate how informal networks of power and patronage offered a crucial means of navigating-or circumventing-the serpentine paths of the governmental hierarchy. The decisions of the Overseas Council, which governed Portugal's imperial holdings, reflected not only the merits of the petitions that came before it, but also the personal and institutional affiliations of the petitioner. In far-flung areas such as São Paulo and Macau, where the formal bureaucracy was weak, local cultural and economic factors held as much sway over the agents of the colonial state as did the dictates of the imperial court at Lisbon.Populated by a host of colorful characters, from backland explorers to colonial magistrates, Power and Corruption in the Early Modern Portuguese World demonstrates how informal social connections both magnified and diminished the power of the colonial state. If such systems contributed to corruption and fraud, they also facilitated effective cross-cultural exchange and ensured the survival of empire in times of crisis and decline. Myrup has produced a trul global study that sheds new light on the influence of interpersonal networks on the administration of a vast overseas empire. © 2015 by Louisiana State University Press.

Through interviews with village elites, we found that highly uneven village voting patterns were strongly influenced by varying patterns of patronage distribution. The winning candidate (the son of the incumbent) used a state-centred form of patronage involving pork barrel and club goods that proved more effective than gifts distributed through social, specifically religious, networks. Also critical were effective and trustworthy community-level brokers to deliver patronage, with retail vote-buying especially vulnerable to broker predation. Among the four categories of brokers we identified, state brokers-notably village heads-were especially effective at marshalling votes. Our findings underline the importance of patronage in Indonesian elections and the centrality of brokers in clientelistic systems generally. They also help explain the domination of former bureaucrats in electoral contests in regional Indonesia. © 2015 Edward Aspinall and Muhammad Uhaib As'ad.","brokerage; clientelism; elections; patronage; pork barrel; vote-buying",,,,,,,"Allen, N.W., (2012) Diversity, Patronage and Parties: Parties and Party System Change in Indonesia, , PhD dissertation, University of British Columbia.]; Aspinall, E., A nation in fragments: Patronage and neoliberalism in contemporary Indonesia (2013) Critical Asian Studies, 45 (1), pp. 27-54; Aspinall, E., Parliament and patronage (2014) Journal of Democracy, 25 (4), pp. 96-110; Aspinall, E., When brokers betray: Clientelism, social networks and electoral politics in Indonesia (2014) Critical Asian Studies, 46 (4), pp. 545-570; Aspinall, E., Fealy, G., (2003) Local Power and Politics in Indonesia: Democratisation and Decentralisation, , Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies; Berenschot, W., (2015) Comparing Patronage Networks: Party, State and Notable in Indonesia and India', , [Unpublished paper.]; (2004) Tanah Laut Dalam Angka 2003, , BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik) Pelaihari: Badan Pusat Statistik Tanah Laut; (2012) Tanah Laut Dalam Angka 2011, , BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik) Pelaihari: Badan Pusat Statistik Tanah Laut; (2013) Kalimantan Selatan Dalam Angka 2012, , BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik) Banjarmasin: Badan Pusat Statistik Kalimantan Selatan; Buehler, M., The rising importance of personal networks in Indonesian local politics: An analysis of direct government head elections in South Sulawesi in 2005 (2009) Deepening Democracy in Indonesia: Direct Elections for Local Leaders (Pilkada), pp. 101-124. , M.

The resultant neopatrimonial state is often blamed for the social, political, and economic ills plaguing these societies. This essay challenges conventional wisdom and argues that neopatrimonialism is a process of hybrid state formation that has its origins in the cultural politics of colonial state building. This is achieved by drawing on a comparative study of British Malaya and the American Philippines, which offers contrastive trajectories of colonialism and state formation in Southeast Asia. Because of the precariousness of state power due to local resistance and class conflicts, colonial state building involved the deepening of patron-client relations for political control and of rational-legal bureaucracy for social development. In the process, local political relations were marked and displaced as traditional patrimonialisms distinguished from the new modern center. Through native elite collaborators and paternal-populist discourses, new patron-client relations were institutionalized to connect the colonial state to the native periphery. However, colonial officials with different political beliefs and ethnographic world views in the center competed over native policy and generated cyclical crises between patron-clientelist excess and bureaucratic entrepreneurship. Instead of the prevailing view that postcolonial states are condemned to their colonial design, and that authoritarian rule favors economic development, my study shows that non-Western state formation is non-linear and follows a cyclical pattern between predation and developmentalism, the excesses of which could be moderated.

In this paper I concentrate on the historical antecedents of this state of affairs. Focusing on the Igbo-speaking south-east of the country, I argue that an understanding of contemporary Nigeria must be based on a syncretic analysis: that is, a combination of influences from pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. Despite this, the colonial era should not be downplayed as an influence, as some have sought to argue. In particular, I argue that the imposition of warrant chiefs in previously acephalous communities with participatory governance engendered a belief that government did not belong to local people. © 2014 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","bureaucracy; colonialism; governance; historical syncretism; Igbo; Nigeria","anthropology; bureaucracy; colonialism; corruption; ethnic conflict; ethnic group; governance approach; historical geography; political instability; Nigeria",,,,,,"Achebe, C., (1960) No Longer at Ease, , Oxford: Heinemann; Achebe, C., (2001) Home and Exile, , New York: Random House; Afigbo, A.E., (1972) The Warrant Chiefs: Indirect Rule in Southeastern Nigeria, 1891-1929, , London: Macmillan; Afigbo, A.E., The indigenous political systems of the igbo (2005) Igbo History and Society: The Essays of Adiele Afigbo, , in T.

It uses the example of patronage jobs in the U.S. local governments to provide empirical support for this claim. It shows that the number of public employees is higher for elected chief executives. This difference is stronger in public services with bigger private-public wage differential and it increases during election years. It also finds that the number of public employees increases with the age of bureaucrats while there is no such relationship in the case of politicians, which is consistent with younger bureaucrats having stronger career concerns. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bureaucrats; Career concerns; Patronage; Politicians; Targeted redistribution",,,,,,,"Akhmedov, A., Zhuravskaya, E., Opportunistic political cycles: test in a young democracy setting (2004) Q.

While the literature on state institutions suggests they are best built under local ownership, this article shows how international actors in collaboration with local actors managed to build two effective state bureaucracies in postwar Kosovo: the police force and the customs service. Contrary to the article’s Hypothesis 1 on local ownership, international actors insulated the effective bureaucracies from political and societal influences in order to prevent them from becoming sites of patronage. Thus, these institutions built on meritocratic recruitment and promotion. Employing a comparative research design, the article utilizes national survey data as well as data from 150 semistructured interviews conducted during ten months of fieldwork in Kosovo. By contrasting the state’s constituent bureaucracies, which vary in effectiveness, and thus avoiding the reduction of the state to a unitary abstract actor, this research offers a fresh perspective on postwar state building. Furthermore, it contributes three innovative sets of indicators to measure effective bureaucracies: mission fulfillment, penalization of corruption, and responsiveness to the public. © 2015 Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.","International organizations; Kosovo; State building",,,,,,,"Thakur, R.C., Responsibility to Protect redefines sovereignty as the responsibility of a government to protect its population.

While modern states in the region struggle for coexistence, imperial authorities, especially Ottoman, was relatively successful to endure its rule over different identities as minority across region. It is recorded that the Ottomans' long history as imperium is supported by their ability to develop and implement system to incorporate different identities under their rule known as millet system. Historical exploration as used in this paper suggests that the concept was adopted from Islamic teologic tradition in respond to the reality of mixture society in newly conquered territories which resembles the character of the Ottomanism itself since Suleyman. The mundane aspect of the millet system can be seen from the way of the Ottomans' rulers handling the major minority groups such as Greeks and Jews based on their personal or social and economic capabilities. One of the obvious beneficial relations with the groups is the ability to do trading and fill positions in foreign services that lead particular group to enjoy better position in bureaucracy and society. The differences, in fact, have influenced the arrangement and treatment of the Ottoman rulers towards them over time which were also heavily affected by political changing in the case of the Greeks for example. Therefore, the arrangements of the minority groups are based on mutual benefit that suits both objectives which was able to last for centuries. However, it is also found that the Greeks and Jews' ability to survive is heavily based the character of Ottoman bureaucracy which is patrimonial. In that case, patronage relation is important and acknowledgement on merit and achievement is rarely found. © 2012, Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies.Salah satu aspek yang membuat kawasan Timur Tengah berbeda adalah keberadaan identitas-identitas yang bersifat sektarian bersamaan dengan dibangunnya lembaga-lembaga modern, seperti negara bangsa. Sementara konsep negara terkini di kawasan itu berjuang untuk mempertahankan kehidupan ssecara bersama, penguasa-penguasa kerajaan seperti Ottoman, dapat dikatakan berhasil mempertahankan kekuasaannya atas kelompok-kelompok masyarakat kecil dengan identitas yang berbeda di berbagai wilayah. Tercatat bahwa sejarah panjang Ottoman sebagai sebuah kerajaan didukung oleh kemampuan mereka untuk membangun dan menerapkan sebuah cara yang dikenal dengan millet untuk menerima dan menyerap identitas yang berbeda di bawah kekuasaan mereka. Penelusuran sejarah seperti yang dilakukan di dalam tulisan ini menyarankan bahwa istlah millet itu diambil dari tradisi teologi Islam sebagai tanggapan terhadap realitas kemajemukan masyarakat di daerah-daerah yang baru ditaklukkan dan ini pada dasarnya menggambarkan ciri khas dari cara pandang Ottoman sejak Suleyman. Unsur keduniaan dari sistem tersebut dapat dilihat dari cara penguasa-penguasa Ottoman menangani kelompok-kelompok minoritas yang utama seperti Yunani dan Yahudi yand didasarkan atas kemampuan perorangan ataupun kelebihan ekonomi dan sosialnya. Salah satu contoh nyata hubungan yang saling menguntungkan dengan mereka adalah kemampuan untuk berdagang dan mengisi jabatan-jabatan di kantor hubungan luar negeri yang membuat sebagian dari mereka menikmati posisi yang lebih baik di pemerintahan maupun masyarakat. Perbedaan-perbedaan itu, pada kenyatannya, telah mempengaruhi pula penanganan dan perlakuan penguasapenguasa Ottoman terhadap mereka dalam jangka waktu yang lama yang juga dipengaruhi oleh perubahan politik seperti yang terjadi pada kelompok Yunani. Karenanya, penanganan yang berbeda terhadap kelompok-kelompok minoritas itu pada dasarnya saling menguntungkan dan hal itu sesuai dengan kebutuhan kedua belah pihak dan mampu bertahan dalam kurun waktu berabad-abad. Selain itu, tulisan ini juga mengungkap bahwa kemampuan kelompok Yunani dan Yahudi untuk mempertahankan posisi mereka di hadapan penguasa bergantung kepada karakter birokrasi Ottoman sendiri yang bersifat patrimonial. Dalam kasus ini, hubungan yang bersifat patronase menjadi penting dan pengakuan terhadap prestasi dan pencapaian kerja dapat dikatakan jarang ditemukan. © 2012, Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies.","Greeks; Jews; Millet system; Minority groups; Ottoman; Patrimonialism",,,,,,,"Barkey, K., ""Islam and Toleration: Studying the Ottoman Imperial Model,"" International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society, 19 (1-2), pp. 5-19. , The New Sociological Imagination II (Dec., 2005); Benbassa, E., (1995) The Jews of the Balkans: the Judeo-Spanish Community, 15th to 20th Centuries, , Oxford: Blackwell; Blumi, I., ""Contesting the Edges of Ottoman Empire: Rethinking Ethnic and Sectarian Boundaries in the Malesore, 1878-1912"" (2003) International Journal of Middle East Studies, (35); Braude, B., Lewis, B., (1980) Christians and Jews in the Ottoman Empire: the Functioning of a Plural Society, , New York: Holmes & Meier Publishers; Cohen, H.J., (1973) The Jews of the Middle East 1860-1972., , Jerusalem: Israel University Press; Findley, C.V., (1996) ""The Administrative Legacy and Modern Middle East"", pp. 155-169. , Brown, Carl L.

In order to combat the age-old skepticism about government intervention that emanated from the Jeffersonian tradition in American politics (i.e. that government is best which governs least), the Progressives used their positions in academe, journalism, and government to wage a crusade against the spoils system whereby the managers of government enterprises were typically political patronage appointees (Rothbard 1995). In its place, they argued, should be an army of professionally trained (by Progressive intellectuals) bureaucrats who would in theory serve only the public interest, especially if civil service regulations could protect them from political pressures and firings, granting them effective lifetime tenure in their jobs. No longer would the management of government enterprises change hands with every election cycle. That would supposedly assure that government employees would serve the public interest and not private political interest. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

The time has come to look more critically at the view still prevalent in the social sciences that patronage is ‘a perverse and backward political practice, which prevails only where modern states fail’ (Introduction, 3). This limited view presumes a bureaucratic model of a ‘legal rational’ ideal-type, as prescribed by Max Weber. Interestingly, Weber himself saw the bureaucracies which emerged before World War I, and the business corporations which sprung up alongside, as the purest examples of this type (Constas 1958). Sociological research since Weber has shown the vast distance between formal and actual functioning of these institutions. After the economic crises of the 1970s, governments handed over large areas of economic life to the corporate sector. Other types of social provision, too, have been increasingly modified on what are seen as ‘market principles’, these mimetic efforts resulting in strange, parastate institutional hybrids like quasi-autonomous nongovernmental organisations (QUANGOs). © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107296930; 9781107056084,,,"English","Patronage as Politics in South Asia",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011357027

These morally ambiguous figures have had a chequered history in studies of everyday life in South Asia, and beyond. In this literature, their penchant for turning social relations into a means to accumulate status, political power and capital often overshadows their ability to extend help or represent the interests of their clients in the face of market forces or the quagmires of state bureaucracies. Their know-how and know-who, many have argued, contribute to the (re)production of social hierarchies and inequalities, thus coming in the way of democratic participation and free market exchange. This chapter traces the ways in which modes of connectedness in Kerala-from the extended family to networks held together by the well-known figure of the broker or go-between-articulate with styles of networking in the Gulf, and especially with the Arab system of wasta, or ‘advantage via social connection’. By considering the role of connectedness and mediation in the everyday life of migrants and would-be migrants to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries of West Asia-for long a popular destination for hundreds of thousands of Keralan migrants-I aim to unsettle abstract moral evaluations which often inform distinctions drawn between the figures of patron and broker. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: 113210/1",,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107296930; 9781107056084,,,"English","Patronage as Politics in South Asia",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011343080

After the Theodosian Code, Libanius stands out as the single most important source for the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire (PLRE) or ‘Who’s Who’ of the EasternRoman Empire in the fourth century ad. The principal source for documenting the network is the collection of some 1,544 extant letters: 1,269 written in the decade 355–65, 250 in the period 388–393. Nearly 700 people appear in the letters, including court officials of all ranks from the emperor on down, prefects and governors, lawyers and doctors, army generals and sophists, city councillors, old schoolmates and both present and former pupils. The letters suggest a world constantly travelling and making and maintaining connections. Due to the difficulty of Libanius’ Greek and the absence of a complete translation (cf. Chapter 7), the breadth of his connections, and the relative absence of up-to-date scholarly aids, the letters, which are the richest source for patronage studies fromthe ancient world, remain little studied. After an eighteen-year absence for study and teaching, Libanius returned to his native Antioch in 354, never again to journey a major distance from the city gates. Antioch would become the centre of his social world and geographical hub of his personal network. It was an excellent place from which to develop and maintain a far-flung network: cosmopolitan and wealthy, it was often in the fourth century an imperial residence, and at mid-century it was headquarters not only to the governor of Syria, but also to the comes Orientis (Count of the East) and the praefectus praetorio Orientis (Praetorian Prefect of the East).It was thus a city top-heavy with government officials and a magnet for people in pursuit of social and political advancement. © 2014, Cambridge University Press.

Variously referred to as dalaals, pyraveerkars or, more denigratingly, as chamchas or taporis, these brokers have acquired a key role in the flow of information and resources between state institutions and India’s citizens, and have accordingly been described as ‘lubricants’ or ‘enablers’ of India’s democracy (Reddy and Haragopal 1985; Manor 2000). While the often-lucrative nature of their work attracts derogatory comments about the selfishness of the ‘services’ (seva) which they provide, political fixers are generally indispensable for both citizens and power holders. They channel the demands of citizens to alien and often unresponsive state institutions and supply government officials with the information necessary to implement policies and uphold regulation. They also help politicians to trade access to state resources for electoral support. Such brokers are central to many post-colonial democracies, but it has been argued that they play a more prominent role in India than anywhere else (Manor 2000, 817). Given the centrality of political fixers to the everyday functioning of India’s democracy, there are surprisingly few studies devoted solely to them. They make regular appearances in writings on other subjects, like the literature on India’s political parties, which highlights how in India’s ‘patronage democracy’ brokers help politicians convert state resources into electoral support. They also appear in writings on governance and service delivery, which show how networks of politicians and political fixers interfere with state policies (Mooij 1999; Veron et al. 2003; Baud and de Wit 2008). © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107296930; 9781107056084,,,"English","Patronage as Politics in South Asia",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925600849

Over the course of the 20th century, these elites have come to occupy a somewhat lower social position. In this paper, the fascist era and the first years of the Republic are discussed. The first law on senior civil servants was not adopted until 1972, and even then it had limited scope. Since the 1993-1998 period, when contracts were introduced for civil servants and then senior officials, those in senior management positions continued to be too close to the world of politics, and a system of patronage was introduced. In the absence of any proper training, new public management is only a superficial notion, and the average age of senior officials is still high, despite an intake of young people who have been recruited after doing competitive training courses.","Age; Culture; Elite; Innovation; Italy; Politics; Senior civil servants; Senior officials",,,,,,,"ASTRID, Vandelli, L., (2012) Il Governo delle Regioni: Sistemi Politici, Amministrazioni, Autonomie Speciali, , dir., Bologna, Il Mulino; Cassese, S., L'amministrazione dello stato liberale-democratico (1974) La Formazione Dello Stato Amministrativo, pp. 12-13. , S.

Why did the political and socio-economic elites choose collaboration in Sweden and violent confrontation in Spain? This article underlines an overlooked intervening factor: the organization of the bureaucracy. In the late 19th century, semi-authoritarian Sweden created a meritocratic autonomous bureaucracy. In contrast, Spain-where executive and administrative positions were frequently accountable to parliamentary dynamics-built a patronage-based administration. The result was that the ruling Swedish Left could not offer public offices to core supporters and had to restrict its policies to satisfy the (more collaborationist) demands of its ""policy-seekers,"" while the ruling Spanish Left, thanks to the ample margin of maneuver it enjoyed to appoint and promote state officials, could satisfy the (more confrontational) demands of its ""office-seekers."" © The Author(s) 2013.","civil war; patronage; public administration; quality of government",,,,,,"Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, RJ: M2206-0760","Åmark, K., (1992) Creating Social Democracy: A Century of the Social Democratic Labor Party in Sweden, pp. 56-77. , Misgeld K.Molin K.A°mark K., ed.;, University Park: Pennsylvania University Press; Beevor, A., (2002) The Spanish Civil War, , (1st ed.).

Three organizational actors include presidents, sponsoring government departments, and the concerned quangos. Although results vary by executive position, the findings of the empirical analysis with multinomial probit and generalized linear mixed models support the idea that the appointment of quango executives is not the result of presidential choice but that of the interactions among the key organizational actors, with different incentives and resources, on the appointment.

It places political clientelism in the theoretical framework of a democratic political system characterized by internal differentiation in government and bureaucracy, party politics and a politically relevant public. Against the background of existing research on the link between democracy and political clientelism, it uses Luhmann's concept of power and more specifically his model of the formal and the informal power cycle to point out parallels and differences between a political system based on expectations with regard to policies and a political system in which clientelistic expectations prevail. Democratic political systems are based on formal, legally codified power and informal power. Clientelistic power is a special form of informal power affecting this interplay, as the example of democratization in Mexico shows. Political systems with clientelistic expectations differ from those with a policy orientation with regard to the complexity of policies, the generalization of political support, the bases for personalization, the pattern of interest articulation and the most prominent external influences on the system. © The Author(s) 2013.","democracy; differentiation; Mexico; patronage; political clientelism; political system; power; welfare state",,,,,,,"Albright, J.J., The multidimensional nature of party competition (2010) Party Politics, 16 (6), pp. 699-719; Auyero, J., (2001) Poor People's Politics: Peronist Survival Networks and the Legacy of Evita, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Banck, G.A., Personalism in the Brazilian body politic: Political rallies and public ceremonies in the era of mass democracy (1998) European Review of Latin American and Carribean Studies, 65, pp. 25-43; Barkey, K., Parikh, S., Comparative perspectives on the state (1991) Annual Review of Sociology, 17, pp. 523-549; Brans, M., Rossbach, S., The autopoiesis of administrative systems: Niklas Luhmann on public administration and public policy (1997) Public Administration, 75 (3), pp. 417-439; Buenker, J.D., Sovereign individuals and organic networks: Political cultures in conflict during the Progressive Era (1988) American Quarterly, 40 (2), pp. 187-204; Chubb, J., (1981) Political Clientelism, Patronage and Development, pp. 57-90. , Eisenstadt SNLemarchand R, ed.;, Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Chubb, J., (1981) Political Clientelism, Patronage and Development, pp. 91-124. , Eisenstadt SNLemarchand R, ed.;, Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Collier, D., Levitsky, S., Democracy with adjectives: Conceptual innovation in comparative research (1997) World Politics, 49 (3), pp. 430-451; Cox, G.W., Thies, M.F., The cost of intraparty competition: The single, nontranferable vote and money politics in Japan (1998) Comparative Political Studies, 31 (3), pp. 267-291; Ertman, T., (1997) Birth of the Leviathan: Building States and Regimes in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Esping-Andersen, G., van Kersbergen, K., Contemporary research on social democracy (1992) Annual Review of Sociology, 18, pp. 187-208; Ferrera, M., The 'southern model' of welfare in social Europe (1996) Journal of European Social Policy, 6 (1), pp. 17-37; Fox, J., The difficult transition from clientelism to citizenship: Lessons from Mexico (1994) World Politics, 46 (2), pp. 151-184; Fox, J., (2007) Accountability Politics: Power and Voice in Rural Mexico, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Gal, J., Is there an extended family of Mediterranean welfare states?

This approach, albeit slow and occasionally cumbersome, is generally assumed to be the most meritocratic method of recruitment. However, while some applicants may have skills suited for a specific position, they may not perform best in a general examination. As long as the system is not abused, a more flexible recruitment process based on, for example, interviews and CV screening, may be more meritocratic. It is therefore necessary to weigh the risk of abuse against the potential gains from more flexibility. Formal civil service examinations are hypothesized in this article to be the most meritocratic way to recruit civil servants only in countries where the risk for patronage is high.

The formation of business groups by controlling families can bring additional agency problems which do not exist in Anglo-Saxon countries, particularly in the US and UK corporations. The expanded control over a number of listed member firms made possible by business groups increases the chances of expropriation of minority shareholders. The more complicated the structure of the business group, the more serious the problem may be. This is especially true in Malaysia where it is widely known that the controlling families of many business groups, particularly the large ones have close relationship with influential senior politicians or government officials. The relationship provides political patronage and protection to facilitate the expropriation activities by the owner-managers. The principal-principal problems can therefore, be more serious. Thus, more understanding of the agency problems facing family-controlled firms can be achieved by examining the business group affiliation issue in some detail. © Medwell Journals, 2014.","Agency problem; Corporate governance; Expropriation; Family-controlled business groups; Pyramidal structure",,,,,,,"Almeida, H.V., Wolfenzon, D., A theory of pyramidal ownership and family business groups (2006) J.

This article explores, from patronage records and private papers, the factors sustaining preferment in the gift of secretaries of state and their governors, rather than by resorting to examinations. Its conclusions are that the practice was associated with class status among senior civil servants, gradually mitigated by promotions from within colonial establishments. Patronage was burdensome to manage centrally and had to be devolved to governors, as colonial establishments expanded, creating a pool of talent among senior officials for secretaries of state to draw on. This trend is evident in establishment statistics from the late 1840s to1871. It supports the Colonial Office claim that the service was 'professional' according to its own criteria of learning through experience in political accommodation with local notables and dealing with emergencies. Thus, the department justified its opposition to competitive examinations for appointments overseas, while tolerating them for junior posts at home, and the practice survived till the end of the century and after. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,"(1855) Appointments for Merit discussed in Official Answers to Official Objections to the Abolition of Patronage, , Administrative Reform Association, Official Paper No.4, London, London,: Gale Cengage Learning, Bodleian Libraries, Oxford, from source library, Harvard Law School Library; Bourne, J.M., The Civil and Military Patronage of the East India Company, 1784-1878 (1977) PhD diss, , University of Leister; Burroughs, P., Imperial Institutions and the Government of Empire (1999) The Oxford History of the British Empire, 3. , In: Porter Andrew, editors The Nineteenth Century, edited by, Oxford, Oxford,: Oxford University Press; Cohen, E.W., (1965) The Growth of the British Civil Service 1780-1939, , London, London,: Frank Cass; Cohn, B.S., Recruitment and Training of British Civil Servants in India, 1800-1860.'

This strand of thinking argues that the state's direction toward ""reform"" is not as coherent as commonly believed, a relevant model for examining the role of the state-owned print and online press as an arm of Vietnam's post-communist marketization project. It argues that Party leaders, facing a breakdown of consensus across the spectrum of political and business elites, are using the press in an attempt to manage a growing number of voices in the political system, but that reporting on many political and corruption scandals has simply become unmanageable for state leaders. Under this paradigm, policy debates between ""reformers"" and ""conservatives"" in Vietnam fall short of explaining press censorship. This semidemocratic concept of the media's role opens up room for a wider understanding of civil society under transitional regimes in Asia. This paper draws on twenty-nine interviews with Vietnamese journalists, editors, media executives, Vietnamese and foreign journalism trainers, and government officials from 2010 to 2011, as well as an analysis of press coverage and internal newsroom documents. © The Author(s) 2013.","Communist Party; Internet and media censorship; journalism; marketization; Vietnam",,,,,,,"Abuza, Z., (2001) Renovating Politics in Contemporary Vietnam, , London: Lynne Rienner; Brown, D., Vietnam's Press Comes of Age (2012) Asia Times Online, , http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/NB18Ae02.html, [Hong Kong], February18, (accessed June 20, 2012); Cheshier, S., (2009), Hanoi; Cohen, J., Arato, A., (1992) Civil Society and Political Theory, , Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press; (2012) Attacks on the Press in 2011: Vietnam, , http://cpj.org/2012/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2011-vietnam.php, Committee to Protect Journalists, (accessed July 5, 2012); (2013) Attacks on the Press in 2012: Vietnam, , http://www.cpj.org/2013/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2012-vietnam.php, Committee to Protect Journalists, (accessed September 20, 2013); Dixon, C., (2004) Rethinking Vietnam, pp. 25-31. , McCargo Duncan, ed.;, London: RoutledgeCurzon; Doan, D.Q., A Review of the Media Communication and Key Tasks in the Future (2012) Ta{Dot below}P Chí Cô{Dot below}Ng Sa{Hook above}N (Communist Review), 15, p. 1. , 6/818; (2013) Freedom of the Press 2013.

The assumptions of disorder and a lack of institutional strength that mark understandings of the postcolonial African state may thus appear appropriate to the analysis of the negotiation of power and authority within the Zimbabwean state. A focus on a politics of disorder does not, however, further our insights into the practical and conceptual place of law and judicial institutions in Zimbabwe. Examining the dynamics within one state institution, the Attorney General's office, I explore the circumstances under which, and the manner in which, the office was politicised, and how those working in or with the office made sense of this process. Officials invoked two registers, one of corruption and politicisation and another of professionalism and 'justice', to explain their experiences with, and expectations of, the Attorney General's office. These views highlight the centrality of contestations over the nature of the judiciary in the imagination of Zimbabwe's state by civil servants, rather than simply demonstrating a weakened, disordered, or hollowed-out state institution. © 2013 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.",,"corruption; political relations; political system; post-colonialism; power relations; Zimbabwe",,,,,,"Comaroff, J.L., Colonialism, Culture and the Law: A Foreword (2001) Law and Social Inquiry, 26 (2), pp. 305-314; Chanock, M., (1985) Law, Custom and Social Order: The Colonial Experience In Malawi and Zambia, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Falk, M.S., (1986) Social Facts and Fabrications: Customary Law On Kilimanjaro, 1880-1980, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Mann, K., Roberts, R., (1991) Law In Colonial Africa, , eds, London, James Currey; Merry, S.E., Legal Pluralism (1988) Law and Society Review, 22 (5), pp. 869-896; Zimudzi, T.B., African Women, Violent Crime and the Criminal Law in Colonial Zimbabwe, 1900-1952 (2004) Journal of Southern African Studies, 30 (3), pp. 499-517; Cooper, F., Stoler, A.L., (1997) Tensions of Empire: Colonial Cultures In a Bourgeois World, , London, University of California Press; Berman, B., Structure and Process in the Bureaucratic States of Colonial Africa (1992) Unhappy Valley: Conflict In Kenya and Africa, p. 141. , in B.

We employed ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares regressions to analyze the effects of state ownership on firm performance. We go beyond existing research on state ownership by carefully disentangle investment objectives of state-controlled financial institutions. Such state ownership can be classified as profit-oriented and non-profit-oriented, in which the former consider return on investment to be the primary investment objective, whereas the latter prioritizes socio-economic development. We found that profit-oriented state ownership is an effective corporate governance mechanism and provides political patronage to the firm in the form of firm's specific resources and credit financing. Although non-profit-oriented state ownership firms also receive similar political patronage, they tend to be associated with inefficiencies such as the free-rider problems, bureaucracies and political intervention in firm management. We conclude that state ownership consists of heterogeneous entities with respect to corporate governance and firm performance.","Corporate governance; Firm performance; Institutional ownership; Ownership structure; State ownership",,,,,,,"Ang, J.S., Ding, D.K., Government Ownership and the Performance of Government-Linked Companies: The Case of Singapore (2006) Journal of Multinational Financial Management, 16 (1), pp. 64-88; Bliss, M.A., Gul, F.A., Political Connection and Cost of Debt: Some Malaysian Evidence (2012) Journal of Banking & Finance, 36 (5), pp. 1520-1527; Bayrakdaroglu, A., Ersoy, E., Citak, L., Is There a Relationship between Corporate Governance and Value-Based Financial Performance Measures?

In many Asian countries, accelerated economic development, industrialization and urbanization have been accompanied by a growing acceptance that decentralization (the devolution of central state powers, responsibilities and resources to the sub-national scale)4 can lead to more effective and responsive governance in state, provincial, city and regency jurisdictions. This trend toward decentralized governance in Asia has often, but not always, been precipitated by a transition away from authoritarian regimes to more democratic forms of governance. Discourses about the desirability of democratic decentralization have typically emphasized the devolution of central state authority as the preferred means by which to empower communities and to increase the voice and participation of ordinary citizens in governmental decision-making processes that affect their lives and livelihoods. Thus, decentralization policies in urbanizing Asia have aimed to encourage the active involvement of urban residents in addressing shared dilemmas concerning issues such as environmental sustainability, public service delivery, community building and socio-political stability in often densely concentrated and ethnically diverse populations. At the same time, however, decentralization within the contexts of globalization and privatization may circumvent critical aspects of democratic procedure if sub-national government officials use their increased access to state power and resources to nurture clientelistic networks of patronage and/or to tap into wider circles of regional or global economic activity at the expense of local urban development. © Pacific Affairs.

Through a case study of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), I examine the selection problem facing the ruling party. Within the CCP, special training academies, also known as party schools, serve as a pipeline to higher party and government posts. An examination of selection patterns for these schools reveals that there exists a mix of political and professional factors which determine invitation to a party school training program, suggesting the coexistence of patronage and meritocratic processes in promotion for higher office. Empirical analysis of these selection processes takes three parts. Individual-level characteristics, such as party membership, frequency of interaction with superiors, and educational background, are significant predictors of selection for a party school program. Second, to control for selection bias, I employ a matching procedure and find that the ""treatment"" of enrollment in a party school training program significantly increases the likelihood that an individual will be promoted to a higher rank in comparison to those without party school training experience. Third, additional tests indicate that these schools serve a screening function for the party, thus providing an organizational means for CCP leaders to manage who enters the highest ranks of political leadership. In this sense, the training process itself serves an informational function for party authorities, beyond the ritual these organizations are long thought to embody. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bureaucracy; China; Patronage; Ruling party organization; Selection problem; Single-party dictatorship","authoritarianism; bureaucracy; election; empirical analysis; leadership; party politics; China",,,,,,"Alpermann, B., The post-election administration of Chinese villages (2001) China J, 46, pp. 45-67; Ang, Y.Y., (2007) Public employment as redistribution in China: Fiscal games, mass clientelism, or risk management?, , Paper presented at the Midwest Political Science Association, Chicago; Ang, Y.Y., Counting cadres: a comparative view of the size of China's public employment (2012) China Q, 211, pp. 676-696; Arrow, K.J., Higher education as a filter (1973) J Public Econ, 2, pp. 193-216; Becker, S.O., Ichino, A., Estimation of average treatment effects based on propensity scores (2002) Stata J., pp. 1-19; Blaydes, L., (2011) Elections and Distributive Politics in Mubarak's Egypt, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bo, Z., The institutionalization of elite management in China (2004) Holding China Together: Diversity and National Integration in the Post-Deng Era, pp. 70-100. , B.

Drawing on the methodologies of middle range theory and grounded theory, qualitative data are gathered from the case of Cambodia and then analyzed. The result is the proposition that a specific constellation of reform-inhibiting factors explains the slow progress of public administration reform in Cambodia. At the center of the constellation is patronage. The cluster of surrounding and interrelated factors includes weak accountability, hegemonic political regime, high and legitimate power distance, low wages, and bureaucratic dysfunction. The chances of reform success increase with the removal or absence of these inhibiting factors. The analysis emphasizes the importance of political economy factors in determining the success or failure of public administration reform. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Asia bureaucracy; Building theory; Bureaucracy; Cambodia; Public administration reform","accountability; administrative framework; bureaucracy; hegemony; political economy; public administration; reform process; theoretical study; Cambodia",,,,,,"(2003) Democracy in Cambodia-2003: A Survey of the Cambodian Electorate, , Asia Foundation.

Among all public administration careers, that of expert in public policies and government management (EPPGM) is an exemplary case, since its creation brings the idea of constituting a stable bureaucracy in face of discontinuities in government, able to prepare and manage public policies in a continued flow, something which justifies studying it. Through various sources related to the career evolution, the profile, and training of these managers, and their distribution in the federal Executive Power, we demonstrate that the very training of these public officials ended up undergoing government interferences according to government guidance and that allocating these EPPGMs to jobs of Superior Management and Advisement (SMA) of the federal Executive has reconciled meritocratic principles with a certain relaxation of appointments, restricting, in theory, the spaces for political patronage.","Bureaucracy; Career; Government management; Public administration; Public policy",,,,,,,"Aberbach, J., Putnam, R., Rockman, B., (1981) Bureaucrats et policians westerns democracies, , Massachuts: Harvart University Press; Abrúcio, F., Trajetória recente da gestão pública brasileira: Um balanço crítico e a renovação da agenda de reformas (2007) Rev. de Adm.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on government reports, reports of international bodies, and the data produced for various governance indicators, as well as scholarly analysis of performance management and new public management. Findings – After the 1997 Asian financial crisis, many Asian countries, including developed and developing, have introduced a variety of performance management systems into their bureaucracies. This has been encouraged by international agencies as part of their “good governance” agendas. Despite this, the goal of achieving efficient and workable public administration has still not been realized in many cases. Anti-corruption measures are not effective, and efficiency and service delivery in public organization has not significantly improved. However, political leaders must recognize that the building of rational legal bureaucracy in which patronage influence is reduced, creating networked governance, allowing engagement with civil society, and fostering high employee motivation, are the other prerequisites for achieving efficient and accountable government. Only then will performance management contribute to this aim. Originality/value – The value of this paper is to show that within the context of Asian bureaucracies, performance management is not a panacea to guarantee improvements in public administration. Other requirements are necessary, as indicated above, especially the creation of rational legal bureaucracy. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Administrative reform; Asia; Corporate governance; Corruption; Good governance; Institutionalization; New public management; Performance (public administration); Performance management; Public administration",,,,,,,"(2007) APEC Economic Policy Report, , www.apec.org/Groups//media/Files/Groups, available at: / EC/07_ ec_AEP_Fnl. ashx (accessed 26 February 2011); (2007) The Philippines: annual programme performance update 2006-2007, , www.auaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/phil_appr_2007.pdf, available at: (accessed 26 February 2011); Berman, E.M., Public administration in Southeast Asia: an overview (2011) Public Administration in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Macao, , in Berman, E.M.

Each year, the Chief fills positions within that bureaucracy, designating Article III judges to various specialty courts and appointing such officers as the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Although critics worry that the Chief may use his appointment role to shape Third Branch policy unduly, scholars view the role as constitutionally benign. This Article questions the Chief's role. The Constitution authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of inferior officers in the ""courts of law"" but not the Chief Justice. History teaches that this was a deliberate choice (to curtail the corrupting influence of patronage powers) and one to which the nation's first Chief, John Jay, scrupulously adhered. After tracing the decline of the early practice, the Article proposes the return to a court-based appointment model. © 2013 by James E.

Together with other trends, such as globalisation in general and a growing European-wide legalism, the European Economic Area (EEA) has already had a strong impact on Icelandic politics. The EEA is largely about delegation without accountability, which means that there has been a significant loss of sovereignty to EU institutions. However, the EEA has also meant a move towards a clearer demarcation of political roles, which has in fact increased the autonomy of the parliament (the Althing) vis-a-vis the cabinet. The separation of roles between cabinet ministers and civil servants has also become more clear-cut. In sum, while the Iccland-EU relationship Lends to make national politics more diffuse, the EEA has also made some of the domestic principal-agent relationships more transparent. © 2000 Frank Cass & Co.

These were the years of resurgent nationalisms across the Soviet Union. Karimov, during pub lic meetings, presented himself as a leader of the whole nation who would stand above of any ‘clan’ or regional patronage network. Karimov also denounced clan politics and swore to fight and eradicate these from Uzbekistani reality. In a book that he published in 1997, Karimov listed regionalism and clans among the seven mostimportant threats to the country’s security. Karimov therefore acknowledged that the phenomenon of ‘clans’ had not disappeared after years of anti-corruption campaigns during the Soviet period (1997: 59). What Karimov did not add was that, as a politician and head of the state, he was himself the product of ‘clan’ politics. During his brief tenure as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan, Karimov established himself as a leader capable of meeting the expectations and hopes of various informal elite factions in the pursuit of key negotiations with Moscow. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Karimov’s election to the presidency, his government gained control over the most important economic resources, including cotton, precious and non-ferrous metals and other minerals. Once independence was proclaimed, Karimov also presided over the rehabilitation of Sharaf Rashidov and the amnesty of dozens of other government officials and regional elites who had been arrested and jailed in connection with Moscow’s anti-corruption cam paigns in the middle and late 1980s (Carlisle 1995). A number of local officials associated with Sharaf Rashiov and his patronage networks were also granted key positions in the government. This was the case for Shukrullo Mirsaidov and Timur Alimov, two key members of the Tashkent ŉetwork’, who respectively became Prime Minister and Presidential Adviser; Ismail Jurabekov who repres ented the Samarkand-Jizzak region was also appointed Deputy Prime Minister, a position that involved control over water management and agriculture. Karimov, how ever, soon distanced himself from factional groups and even assumed the posture of a referee, as Moscow used to do. This enabled him to manipulate inter-factional rivalries so as to promote a ‘divide-and-rule’ strategy. As he strengthened his grip over power, Karimov’s dependency on previous allies and partners loosened. Karimov, how ever, did not use this opportunity to build and enforce democratic and legal institutions that would have curbed the spread of neopatrimonialism. He strengthened instead his personal rule through neopatrimonial practices and by playing factions off one another. The outcome was a kind of check-and-balance system that remained, how ever, limited to the sphere of informal relationships within the executive government. The elimination of old ‘clan’ leaders was supplemented by limitations installed on the capacity of local elites to get access to the profitable mining and cotton sectors (Ilkhamov 2004: 1). Step by step, major export resources became concentrated in the hands of the central government and fell under the personal supervision of Karimov. The seizure of major national resources went along with the preservation of a command economy. The introduction of elements of free market in the economy remained limited and highly selective. As had been the case during the Soviet period, the planned economy and the monopoly exercised over power by a single political grouping created a favourable turf for the re-emergence of ‘clan’ formations and inter-clan rivalries. So as to diminish the sway of regional leaders, Karimov adopted a pol icy of frequent rotations of the regional hokims (governors), ousted from their posts every three years on average as estimated for the period between 1993 and 2002 (Ilkhamov 2004: 170). The reason invoked for these dismissals was usually the corruption of the office holders. In a number of cases, dismissals were also followed by criminal charges brought against the ousted hokim. Despite the frequent occurrence of these corruption charges, nothing was done to reform the system and reduce the opportunities for abuse of power among local governors. The regional hokims kept being appointed by the President himself and were employed to strengthen the repressive apparatus and surveillance over local governments, institutions and population. What such a policy also achieved was a reduction of the likelihood of conspiracies plotted by local hokims against Karimov himself - who also happened to have been one of them in the past. Minimizing the risk of conspiracy by the local hokims coincided with the rise of influence of a new type of patronage networks within key ministries in the central government. Structures responsible for security, law enforcement, tax collection, custom, finances and export procurement became particularly powerful. Thus, fierce competition grew between the Interior Ministry and the National Security Services, a rivalry tacitly encouraged by the President, as part of the same check-and-balance system. The power of these two administrations stemmed from wielding almost unchecked coercive power, as much as from the acquisition of considerable economic power. Much of this was achieved by gaining informal control over spheres of economic activity that range from export trade, retail and catering businesses to drug trafficking. This pattern still remains unchecked today, perhaps because President Karimov sees it as a retribution for loyalty and an opportunity to keep the respective patronage leaders on leash by threatening them to the use of compromising evidence collected while tracing their corrupt deeds. Law enforcement agencies have also actively contributed to the enrichment of the presidential family. Building familial wealth has become quite an extensive business, resulting in the emergence of what may be described as a kind of ‘mega-clan’, centred on the Presidential family. Usage of this term to de scribe a phenomenon observed in several other post-Soviet authoritarian regimes, enables to stress the existence of a hierarchy that combines personal rule and patronage through access to administrative structures and support from other resource affluent ‘clans’. Karimov’s daughter, Gulnara Karimova, until recent times was considered as one of most probable candidates to his succession. She also played a key role in the creation and expansion of this ‘mega-clan’. From the late 1990s onwards, the growth of Gulnara Karimova’s business empire was spectacular, both in terms of economic might and political clout. Thanks to the support of her father, and backing up from the administrative apparatus of law enforcement and the security agencies as well as some ‘clan’ groupings, business structures reportedly associated with Gulnara Karimova acquired one asset after another. Early in 2011, she featured among the 300 richest people in Switzerland where her assets were estimated around US$600 million.8 This ‘mega-clan’ phenomenon highlights a key distinction between Karimov style of neopatrimonial rule and Stalin’s. Unlike Stalin, Karimov has, like other post-Soviet rulers, embraced the market economy, albeit in a very selective and ‘kleptocratic’ manner. He clearly had little concern for the egalitarian ideals which were putting certain limits to the egoistic aspirations of office holders in Soviet times. This also gives a clue to the specific slant of Karimov’s neopatrimonial rule, namely the combination of two mutually supportive factors, namely the hyper-centralization of the administrative system due to exceptional control of power as sumed by the President, and, secondly, the selective adoption of market economy and its institutions so as to allow the ruling elite to legalize its capture of resources and capital. This mix between monopolistic patterns of political control and elements of market economy is the hallmark of Uzbekistan’s brand of neopatrimonialism. Such a pattern, needless to say, represents one of major obstacle to the economic, political and institutional development of the country. © 2012 Selection and editorial matter, Daniel C.

It appears to be a highly politicised structure in which its senior officers are personal appointees of the President who will resign as soon as the chief executive leaves office. The system therefore appears to have stagnated in the early nineteenth century and resembles, apart from its size, the pre-Northcote-Trevelyan bureaucracy of Britain. It is, however, often presumed that an advantage of this structure is that it ensures the obedience of the bureaucracy to the elected chief executive. These perceptions are misleading. The bureaucracy of the United States may be very different from those of Europe but it is also far removed from early-nineteenth-century patterns of patronage. The country has developed a bureaucratic system that is highly modern and efficient in the context of a system of government based on very different principles from European parliamentary systems that are founded on cohesive party structures. © 1990 J.E.

Focusing on the relationship between power brokers and cultural institutions under conditions of state patronage, Pamela Kachurin lays to rest the myth of the imposition of control from above upon a victimized artistic community. Drawing on extensive archival research, she shows that Russian modernists used their positions within the expanding Soviet arts bureaucracy to build up networks of like-minded colleagues. Their commitment to one another and to the task of creating a socially transformative visual language for the new Soviet context allowed them to produce some of their most famous works of art. But it also contributed to the “Sovietization” of the art world that eventually sealed their fate. © 2013 by Northwestern University Press.",,,,,,,,"Archival sources; Moscow; Gosudarstvennyi arkhiv Rossiiskoi Federatsii (GARF); f. 130 (Council of People's Commissars), op. 5, d. 635; f. 150 (Council of People's Commissars), op. 5, d. 602; f. 1250 (All Russia Central Executive Committee), op. 1, d. 1, 55; f.

Modern Middle East Authoritarianism: Roots, Ramifications, and Crisis undertakes this task by addressing not only the mechanisms that allowed Middle Eastern regimes to survive and adapt for decades, but also the obstacles that certain countries face in their current transition to democracy.This volume analyzes the role of ruling elites, Islamists, and others, as well as variables such as bureaucracy, patronage, the strength of security apparatuses, and ideological legitimacy to ascertain regimes’ life expectancies and these factors’ post-uprisings repercussions. Discussing not only the paradigms through which the region has been analyzed, but also providing in-depth case studies of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran, the authors arrive at critical conclusions about dictatorship and possibilities for its transformation.Employing diverse research methods, including interviews, participant observation, and theoretical discussions of authoritarianism and political transition, this book is essential reading for scholars of Middle East Studies, Islamic Studies and those with an interest in the governance and politics of the Middle East. © 2014 Noureddine Jebnoun, Mehrdad Kia and Mimi Kirk.",,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,,,,,9780203734186,,,"English","Modern Middle East Authoritarianism: Roots, Ramifications, and Crisis",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920427420

Founded by Paul III and originally aimed to eradicate Protestant heresy, it followed medieval antecedents but went beyond them by becoming a highly articulated centralized organ directly dependent on the pope. By the late sixteenth century the Roman Inquisition had developed its own distinctive procedures, legal process, and personnel, the congregation of cardinals and a professional staff. Its legal process grew out of the technique of inquisitio formulated by Innocent III in the early thirteenth century, it became the most precocious papal bureaucracy on the road to the first ""absolutist"" state. As Thomas F. Mayer demonstrates, the Inquisition underwent constant modification as it expanded. The new institution modeled its case management and other procedures on those of another medieval ancestor, the Roman supreme court, the Rota. With unparalleled attention to archival sources and detail, Mayer portrays a highly articulated corporate bureaucracy with the pope at its head. He profiles the Cardinal Inquisitors, including those who would play a major role in Galileo's trials, and details their social and geographical origins, their education, economic status, earlier careers in the Church, and networks of patronage. At the point this study ends, circa 1640, Pope Urban VIII had made the Roman Inquisition his personal instrument and dominated it to a degree none of his predecessors had approached. © 2013 University of Pennsylvania Press.

The person of Hmong descent who has attained the highest elected office to date is Mee Moua, winning election as the first Hmong American state senator in Minnesota in 2002. After serving two terms, Moua announced in 2010 that she would not run for a third term. Meanwhile, in California in 2006, Blong Xiong won election as the first Hmong American member of the Fresno City Council. These public servants followed a path in politics set by Choua Lee, who was elected to the school board in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1991, and Joe Bee Xiong, city councilman in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, from 1996 to 2000. In view of the relative recency of the Hmong refugees' settlement in America and their modest financial resources, what explains these electoral successes? Analyzing Mee Moua's first election campaign, Yoshikawa (2006) demonstrated that Hmong voters can be mobilized through clanbased social organization in the Hmong community. But successful Hmong candidates have used dual mechanisms of mobilization-gaining support of traditional leaders and access to voters through existing Hmong social organizations-while also reaching outward across racial-ethnic lines to attract support from voters outside Hmong ethnic enclaves. To extend understanding of opportunities and challenges for Hmong political engagement, I examine in this study how Hmong Americans themselves describe the nature of their interest in American politics. Interviews of Hmong firstgeneration immigrants reveal a high regard for political engagement as an avenue to improve the lives of Hmong in the United States. In addition, first-generation immigrants tend to hold aspirations for their children to pursue careers as government officials. There are precedents in American ethnic history for a new ethnic group choosing politics rather than business enterprise as its route for group advancement. Irish Americans found their way into mainstream social life through politics, constructing urban party machines that provided services and employment to constituents in exchange for their votes. As Daniel Boorstin describes, Irish American politicians adapted village-style patronage politics learned in the homeland to American city life, turning themselves into a ""personal service agency"" for immigrant constituents (1973, 259). Not a small factor in their success was the lack of legal restrictions on voting by noncitizens until 1926. Somewhat similarly, Hmong Americans found a fast path to citizenship at the turn of the twenty-first century. Lobbying Congress with success for the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000, Hmong American men who had served on the side of the U.S. military during the Vietnam War (and soon afterward their wives) gained the opportunity to use English translators when taking citizenship tests. It is clearly possible for new immigrant groups to take the political route to economic opportunity and social inclusion, but the Irish and Hmong American cases suggest that lowering barriers to immigrant voting are probably prerequisites. At the same time, new immigrant groups benefit from adapting traditional political values and practices customary in the homeland to the host society's environment. © 2013 University of Hawai'i Press.

The essay begins with a brief discussion of the state of affairs in Fujian and Taiwan under officials appointed by the Kangxi Emperor. It then turns to the Yongzheng Emperors efforts to revitalize what he perceived to be a moribund bureaucracy in the region through the pursuit of a case of corruption. The trial that resulted from a censors accusation revealed a complex web of patronage, manipulation, malfeasance, and mutual recrimination among officials and provides us a glimpse into the workings of Qing field administration under pressure from a reformist emperor. The corruption case in Taiwan was important to the emperor not on its own merits, but as an object lesson in proper political behavior and bureaucratic accountability. © 2013 Academy of East Asian Studies.","Bureaucracy; China; Factionalism; Qing; Taiwan; Yongzheng emperor",,,,,,,"Fuge, (1984) Tingyu congtan [A collection of talks while listening to the rain], , Beijing: Zhonghua shuju; Liangbi, L., (1958) Chongxiu Fujian Taiwan fu zhi, p. 74. , [Newly revised gazetteer of Taiwan prefecture, Fujian].

On the basis of these assertions, scholars have tended to equate the number of state jobs with cases of patronage. By doing so, they have neglected the crucial issue of the scope of appointments effectively controlled by political parties. This article applies an innovative empirical inquiry to measure the extent of party patronage, assessing where, how deeply, and to what extent parties reach into the Argentine federal state structures. While the results by and large confirm the widespread notion of the broad scope of political appointments in Argentina, they re- fute the conventional hypothesis of a state thoroughly colonized by parties. Overall, the results suggest that parties' distribution of public jobs in the Argentine federal state is oriented less to mass-style patronage than to gaining effective and broad control over state institutions. © 2013 by the Latin American Studies Association.",,,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., Civil Servants and Policymakers: Neutral or Responsive Competence?

The development and sustenance of effective land registry is vital for creation of free movement of interests in land. The land registry provides ready access to up-to-date land information and ensures confident dealings in property and security of title. One of the goals of land registry in developing economy and in Nigeria in particular, is to render services to users in satisfactory ways. This study therefore aimed at examining the users' performance evaluation of Akure Land Registry. One hundred and fifty (150) users of the Akure Land Registry, in Ondo state, Nigeria, comprises of professionals in the built environment were randomly selected and a structured questionnaire was administered on them. Data collected were rated on a five-point Likert scale and analyzed using factor analysis by principal component. The result of the factor analysis reduced the variables necessary for optimum performance of Akure Land Registry which may influence users' patronage of service into four factors: namely environmental factor and impact of bureaucracy; staff strength and competence; Users' friendliness of service provided; and organizational structure suitability. The four factors produced a cumulative loading of 73.84%. Therefore, the registry should pay attention to these factors to enhance the success in their service delivery to the users.","Factor analysis; Land Registry; Performance evaluation","bureaucracy; development economics; facility location; factor analysis; landownership; organizational framework; performance assessment; Nigeria; Ondo",,,,,,"Abdi, H., Factor Rotations in Factor Analysis (2003) Encyclopedia for Research Methods for Social Sciences, pp. 792-795. , In M.

The country's battle for independence, and its history of military dictatorships and dysfunctional democracy, have brought challenges in terms of establishing a sound system of governance. The five pillars of public governance have posed formidable obstacles to establishing and reforming key institutions, refining processes and strategies of management and guiding the country towards a more efficient and effective system. Here we analyse the backgrounds of legislators elected to parliament in 1991, 1996 and 2001, legislative accountability, functional mechanisms, and the constraints of regulatory, administrative and economic institutions in order to examine how poor governance practices have created high levels of patronage in return for short-term political gains. We argue that state institutions have been captured by members of a powerful nexus who have developed a symbiotic relationship with the state, affecting its institutional capacity to reduce corruption, strengthen transparency and accountability, and allow the judiciary and public bureaucracy to work professionally. © 2012 South Asian Studies Association of Australia.","Bangladesh; corruption; Governance; institutions; patronage; politicisation","accountability; bureaucracy; corruption; democracy; governance approach; state role; Bangladesh",,,,,"Ministry of Finance, MOF","Weiss, L., Global governance, national strategies: How industrialized states make room to move under the wto (2005) Review of International Political Economy, 12 (5), pp. 723-749; Weiss, L., The state-augmenting effects of globalisation (2005) New Political Economy, 10 (3), pp. 345-353; Stoker, G., Governance as a theory: Five propositions (1998) International Social Science Journal, 50 (155), pp. 17-28; Pierre, J., Guy Peters, B., (2000) Governance Politics and the State, p. 67. , London: Palgrave Macmillan Press; Hirst, P., Democracy and governance (2000) Debating Governance: Authority, Steering and Democracy, p. 14. , Jon Pierre (ed.), New York: Oxford University Press; Ved, P., Nanda, The ""good governance' concept revisited (2006) The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 603 (1), pp. 269-283; http://mirror.undp.org/magnet/policy/, accessed 24 July 2012; Weiss, L., Developmental states in transition: Adapting, dismantling, innovating, not normalizing (2000) Pacific Review, 13 (1), pp. 21-55; Brinkerhoff, D.W., Goldsmith, A.A., (2000) Participation in Macroeconomic Policy: Experience and Implications for Poverty Reduction Strategies, , Washington DC: World Bank, Oct; Brinkerhoff, D.W., Goldsmith, A.A., Institutional dualism and international development: A revisionist interpretation of good governance (2005) Administration and Society, 37 (2), pp. 199-224; Elias Sarker, A., The new mode of public governance and public accountability in developing countries: An analysis with particular reference to bangladesh (2009) International Journal of Public Administration, 32 (13), pp. 1101-1123; Husain Khan, M., (2009) Building Growth-romoting Governance Capabilities, Background Paper for the Least Developed Countries Report, pp. 1-31. , New York and Geneva: UNCTAD, 2008-09; Alam, Q., The nature of the bangladesh state in the post 1975 period (1993) Contemporary South Asia, 2 (3), pp. 311-325; Alam Majumdar, B., Who got elected to the ninth parliament?

Research was widely perceived as providing solutions to emerging social problems. That generosity came under increased contest in the late 1970s. Although these trends held true for all of the social sciences, this essay explores the various ways by which economists in particular reacted to and resisted the patronage cuts that were proposed in the first budgets of the Reagan administration. Economists' response was three fold: to engage in joint lobbying with other social scientists, to tap into their authority as a respected policy player, and to influence the types of research financed by the patron. With interviews of the former lobbyist for the social scientists, the former director of the Economics program for the National Science Foundation, and a review of the archival records of economists and their scholarly society, we discuss how economists have claimed entitlement to patronage in the closing decades of the twentieth century. We observe a dynamic and productive relationship between politicians and researchers mediated by the National Science Foundation, where civil servants, lobbyist and public minded scientists, and self-serving grantees trade roles. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Economics of science; History of social science; Patronage; Public representations of science",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Bureau of Economic Research, NBER; National Science Board, NSB; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation, NSF","Abella, A., (2008) Soldiers of Reason: The RAND Corporation and the Rise of the American Empire, , Orlando: Harcourt; Amadae, S.M., (2003) Rationalizing Capitalist Democracy: The Cold War Origins of Rational Choice Liberalism, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Funding of Economic Research (1977) American Economic Review, 67 (1), pp. 469-470. , American Economic Association; Report of Committee on Federal Funding of Economic Research (1980) American Economic Review, 70 (2), pp. 479-484. , American Economic Association; Minutes of the annual meeting, December 29, 1981 (1982) American Economic Review, 72 (2), pp. 399-400. , American Economic Association; Bush, V., (1945) Science, the Endless Frontier: A Report to the President, , Washington DC.: US Government Printing Office; Calvert, J., What's special about basic research?

As such, it assesses not only the practice of patronage but also its scope, logic, and style, in order to better understand how democratization, the evolving nature of the Portuguese state and bureaucracy, as well as its parties and party system dynamics, have potentially impacted on the nature of patronage in Portugal. © Petr Kopeckỳ, the estate of Petr Mair, and Maria Spirova 2012.

The evidence presented indicates that meritbased appointments are indeed a large part of the story. It is not the only one, however. In fact, the results indicate that a fairly sharp line can be drawn between the civil service on the one hand, and executing institutions and auxiliary institutions, such as councils and committees, on the other. In the former, the minister's role is circumscribed and influence appears to be exercised on professional rather than political terms. In the latter, some sectors present a more blurry picture, as political motives blend with professional criteria without replacing them. Moreover, it is notable that politics is most evident in appointments to auxiliary institutions. Finally, potential historical and institutional explanations for the existing balance between parties and the state in Denmark are discussed. © Petr Kopeckỳ, the estate of Petr Mair, and Maria Spirova 2012.

It argues that party patronage reaches into all areas of the public sector. Political appointments are relatively more important for the ministerial bureaucracy than for executive agencies and executing institutions such as state-owned enterprises. They are more common at the top of institutions, predominantly for the sake of politically controlling the policy process. The chapter shows that party patronage varies across sectors. Three patterns are distinguished. They are labelled as 'captured sectors' such as the Media, 'partially disciplined sectors' such as Finance and Economy, and 'partially insulated sectors' such as the Judiciary. The chapter concludes that party patronage contributes to the stabilization of parties and party systems in Hungary. Yet patronage increases corruption risks in the public sector, breeds popular distrust in political parties, and hence runs the risk of being self-defeating for the parties that rely on it. © Petr Kopeckỳ, the estate of Petr Mair, and Maria Spirova 2012.

Normatively, it is suggested that it is simply unfair for white, middle-aged males to dominate decision-making structures. Instead it has been argued that representative diversity can enhance the legitimacy of political institutions and processes, whilst improving the quality and inclusivity of policy-making. Although most of these arguments have been applied to elected institutions and their bureaucracies, they are also germane in the context of appointments to the boards of public bodies, as the work of these bodies and the decisions made by their board members impacts upon the everyday lives of citizens. Drawing upon original research conducted in the UK, this article argues that the capacity of political actors to make appointments to public boards offers an as yet unrealized democratic potential by offering more opportunities for social engagement and participation in public governance. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"decision making; democracy; election; electoral system; policy making; political system; recruitment (population dynamics); United Kingdom",,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/H021280/1","Bearfield, D., 'The Demonization of Patronage: Folk Devils and the Boston Globe's Coverage of the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks' (2006) American Public Service: Radical Reform and the Merit System., pp. 101-120. , in J.S.

Interpreting the findings from a range of models evaluating 4,210 organizations in 70 districts, and drawing on in-country interviews with NGO leaders and workers, government officials, and politicians, it finds that sub-national NGO location corresponds to an area's objective level of need, as well as the convenience of the location for accessing beneficiaries, donors, and elite goods. Contrary to dominant theories of African political economy, political factors like patronage appear to have little or no significant influence. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Geographic placement; Kenya; Location; Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); Politics","nongovernmental organization; political economy; Kenya",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Indiana University, IU; University of California Berkeley, UCB","Barkan, J.D., Geist, J.K., Ng'ethe, N., (2003) Kenya in transition, , The World Bank, Washington DC; Barr, A., Fafchamps, M., Owens, T., The governance of non-governmental organizations in Uganda (2005) World Development, 33 (4), pp. 657-679; Bayart, J.-F., (1993) The state in Africa: The politics of the belly, , Longman, New York; Bielefeld, W., Murdoch, J.C., Waddell, P., The influence of demographics and distance on nonprofit location (1997) Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 26 (2), pp. 207-225; Bielefeld, W., Metropolitan nonprofit sectors: Findings from NCCS data (2000) Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 29 (2), pp. 297-314; Bielefeld, W., Murdoch, J.C., The locations of nonprofit organizations and their forprofit counterparts: An exploratory analysis (2004) Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 33 (2), pp. 221-246; Boulding, C., Gibson, C., Supporters or challengers?

The hypothesis of this article is that there are three broad historical factors that influence outbreaks of violence and their resolution: patronage, control of land and preservation of local autonomy. Each element is in dynamic tension, and today the character of their inter-relationship has been altered by narco-profits, foreign military intervention and Afghan Government officials seeking to maximize their local power. The prospects for the province are linked intrinsically to these elements, so that, while foreign forces aim to provide a transition to Afghan Government control and security, there is every likelihood that traditional areas of dispute will reassert themselves. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

On the one hand, these states feature the universal characteristics of modern states, while on the other, seemingly traditional patterns such as patronage, cronyism, etc. are an integral part of their administrations. Furthermore, the states and bureaucracies are fairly stable and able to provide a framework for rapid economic development. This article combines a neo-institutionalist perspective that allows us to 'decouple' organizational structures from action structures, and thus take into account the discrepancy between the modern form and supposedly 'Asian' content of the states. It also considers the facts in the light of concepts such as 'multiple modernities' and 'contested institutionalism'. Thus, different modernization processes that lead to universalism are present, resulting from the interdependency of organizations within a global organizational field, as well as particularism which enables diversity in action. Thailand and Myanmar are taken as case studies, because Thailand has always followed a strategy of international integration, in contrast to isolationist Myanmar. © 2011 Duncker & Humblot GmbH.",,,,,,,,"Berner, E., Kollektive Strategien, Herrschaft und Widerstand.

Perhaps more worryingly, sometimes the cure has been more damaging than the disease. Judicial prosecution has rarely resulted in visible and lasting results, mostly because of low capacity and corruption in the judiciary - typical of postconflict states. Likewise, the establishment of anti-corruption agencies, probably the most common executive anti-corruption approach in peacebuilding contexts, has obtained only meagre results (see John Heilbrunn’s contribution to this volume). In Afghanistan, Kosovo and Sierra Leone, not a single ‘big fish’ has been convicted by an anti-corruption agency. In some extreme cases, anti-corruption agencies are nothing more than another layer of corrupt bureaucracy (de Sousa 2009). It is in this context that policy makers and analysts have turned to civil society hoping to deal more effectively with fighting corruption than current executive-driven strategies (Bolongaita 2005: 13). This chapter acknowledges that civil society can play a positive role in anti-corruption activities, in particular by monitoring the behaviour of public authorities in the unstable and corruption-ridden transition from war towards peace and democracy, and also in providing a ‘voice’ to citizens’ demands for accountability and change. However, the relationship between civil society and corruption is not limited to the former fighting the latter. Civil society organisations in post-conflict states commonly incorporate and reflect the broader political and institutional context in which they operate. Where such a context is dominated by patronage, clientelism and corruption, as is regularly the case in post-conflict settings, civic associations also tend to replicate those vertical bonds. Thus, as this chapter will argue, civil society plays a dual role. At its best, civil society organisations are at the forefront of anti-corruption activities. Media reports of both civil society work and intimidation against whistleblowers confirm how the determination of individuals and groups is essential to exposing corrupt activities. At the same time, many civil society organisations are part of a broader network of patron-client relationships. © 2012 Christine S.

All state plans are promised futures which create a contested dialogue between bureaucrats and citizens. Neoliberal governance makes these interactions particularly ambiguous and opaque, because it relies on decentralized, speculative planning and the stimulation of public-private partnerships. These produce diverse, behind-the-scenes negotiations whose outcome is entirely different from the schemes initially outlined in textual state promises. It also places low-level bureaucrats in a liminal, Janus-faced role, in which they act both to create and to cross a boundary between public and private action. This new mode of rule is particularly problematic in settings such as the Hooghly River, where informality dominates in labor relationships. Bureaucrats deploy practices previously associated with ""corruption"" and patronage in order to enfold networks of unprotected labor into the revenue streams and plans of the state.","Informality; International debt; Liberalization; Neoliberalism; Public deficit; State planning",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/F029233/1, RES-451-26-0456","Adam, B., Groves, C., 1950-2000 Board Meetings of the Calcutta Port Trust, , Calcutta: Port Trust Press; Adam, B., Groves, C., 2001-2006 Board Meetings of the Kolkata Port Trust, , Kolkata: Port Trust Press; Adam, B., Groves, C., (2007) Future Matters: Action, Knowledge, Ethics, , Leiden: Brill; Bear, L., (2007) Lines of the Nation: Indian Railway Workers, Bureaucracy, and The Intimate Historical Self, , New York: Columbia University Press; Breman, J., Guérin, I., Prakash, A., (2009) India's Unfree Workforce: Of Bondage Old and New, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Corbridge, S., Harriss, J., (2000) Reinventing India: Liberalization, Hindu Nationalism and Popular Democracy, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Dash, K., India's International Monetary Fund Loans: Finessing win-set negotiations within domestic and international politics (1999) Asian Survey, 13 (6), pp. 884-907. , November-December; Dev, S.M., Mooij, J., Social sector expenditure in the 1990s: Analysis of central and state budgets (2002) Economic and Political Weekly, pp. 853-866. , 2 March; Elyachar, J., (2005) Markets of Dispossession: NGOs, Economic Development, and The State In Cairo, , Durham: Duke University Press; Ghosh, A., Pathways through financial crisis: India (2006) Global Governance, 12, pp. 413-429; Gupta, A., Blurred boundaries: The discourses of corruption, the culture of politics, and the imagined state (1995) American Ethnologist, 22 (2), pp. 375-402; Gupta, A., Sharma, A., Globalisation and post-colonial states (2006) Current Anthropology, 47 (2), pp. 277-307; Gupta, A., Sivaramakrishnan, K., (2011) The State In India After Liberalization: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, , London: Routledge; Harriss-White, B., (2003) India Working: Essays On Society and Economy, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Hull, M., The file: Agency, authority, and autography in an Islamabad bureaucracy (2003) Language and Communication, 23, pp. 287-314; Hull, M., Ruled by records: The expropriation of land and the misappropriation of lists in Islamabad (2008) American Ethnologist, 35 (4), pp. 501-518; Miyazaki, H., The temporalities of the market (2003) American Anthropologist, 105 (2), pp. 255-265; (2000) Status Paper On Private Sector Participation In the Port Sector, , MOST (Ministry of Surface Transport, India), New Delhi; Roitman, J., (2005) Fiscal Disobedience: An Ethnography of Economic Regulation In Central Africa, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Roy, A., (2002) City Requiem, Calcutta: Gender and The Politics of Poverty, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Roy, A., Nezar, A., (2003) Urban Informality: Transnational Perspectives From the Middle East, Latin America, and South Asia, , Lanham, Md.: Lexington Books; Swyngedouw, E., Governance innovation and the citizen: The Janus face of governancebeyond-the-state (2005) Urban Studies, 42 (11), pp. 1991-2006; van Gennep, A., (1960) The Rites of Passage, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul",,,,,,,,09201297,,,,"English","Focaal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862643714

The data were collected from five groups, 694 total samples from 42 government departments. The instruments were five rating-scale (1-5 level) questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and focus group interviews. Data was analyzed by ANOVA and the content analysis. The results indicated that overall, the average HiPPS administration of the government departments were fairly strength level in grade B (X- = 3.37).

In this part of India, Dalit lives and physical surroundings are quite literally shaped by the state and encounters with state officials in various guises are frequent. I argue that Dalits' dealings with the state have led them to a view which is essentially pragmatic: they see the state in terms of what they can extract from it. While their experiences with local bureaucracy are often frustrating and sometimes humiliating, they nevertheless regard the state as a resource which potentially can be tapped for their advance. Indeed, in light of the disintegration of patronage and heightened caste conflict, they are forced to turn to the state for assistance. The conflict between the two major Dalit castes themselves and between Dalits and the dominant castes over reservations also shows how central state resources are to Dalits' sense of identity. Contrary to much of the literature, then, I suggest that many of the most marginalised believe the state can assist their advance and demand that their political representatives harness state power to work in their interests. ©2011 Taylor & Francis.","Andhra Pradesh; Dalits; Reservations; State","bureaucracy; caste system; ethnic group; political power; racial identity; state role; Andhra Pradesh; India; Harness",,,,,,"Alkire, S., Foster, J., Counting and multidimensional poverty measurement (2008) QEH Working Papers, , Oxford: University of Oxford; Balagopal, K., A tangled web: Subdivision of SC reservations in AP (2000) Economic and Political Weekly, 35 (13), pp. 1075-1081. , (25th March); Balagopal, K., Justice for Dalits among Dalits (2005) Economic and Political Weekly, 40 (29), pp. 3128-3133. , (16th July); Brass, P., (1997) Theft of An Idol: Text and Context In the Representation of Collective Violence, pp. 3128-3133. , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Chaudhury, P., The creamy layer: Political economy of reservation (2004) Economic and Political Weekly, 39 (20), pp. 1989-1991. , (15 May); Corbridge, S., Competing inequalities: The scheduled tribes and the reservations system in India's Jharkhand (2000) Journal of Asian Studies, 59 (1), pp. 62-85; Corbridge, S., Williams, G., Srivastava, M., Veron, R., (2005) Seeing the State: Governance and Governmentality In India, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Das, V., The signature of the state: The paradox of illegibility (2004) Anthropology In the Margins of the State, pp. 225-252. , ed.

Like the colonial systems before them, these centralized bureaucracies have not functioned effectively. One of the main problems is a loose coupling between the formal bureaucratic structure of these states and the informal patrimonial elements, mainly patronage, that came to permeate them. Many scholars thus referred to these states as neopatrimonial. Over the past two to three decades, many governments have begun to replace centralized bureaucracies with different forms of partially patrimonial systems, including various forms of decentralization and partial privatization. This article uses both Weber and contemporary agency theory to evaluate the success of these new forms of partially patrimonial administration and to suggest ways in which they could be made more effective.","Decentralization; Patrimonialism; Semiautonomous revenue authorities; Tax administration",,,,,,,"Julia, A., Principals and agents, colonialists and company men: The decay of colonial control in the Dutch East Indies (1996) American Sociological Review, 61 (1), pp. 12-28; Robert, B., Donald Lien, D.-H., A note on taxation, development and representative government (1985) Politics & Society, 14 (1), pp. 53-70; Jean-Francois, B., Ellis, S., Hibou, B., (1999) The Criminalization of the State in Africa; Becker, G., Stigler, G., (1974) Law Enforcement, Malfeasance, and Compensation of Enforcers, , Oxford: James Curry; Journal of Legal Studies, 3 (1), pp. 1-18; Richard M, B., The administrative dimensions of tax reform in developing countries (1989) Tax Reform in Developing Countries, pp. 315-346. , ed.

This paper examines the accounting dimension of reforms designed to achieve enhanced administrative efficiency and greater economy in the operation of government departments. A growing interest in the role of accounting within British government during the second quarter of the nineteenth century is elucidated, and prevailing ideas concerning how accounting within government departments and accountability from the executive to parliament might be performed more efficiently and effectively are uncovered. The battle between divergent pressure groups concerning who should possess jurisdiction over accounting work is explored, and the solution to this problematic is found to connect with the nature of a central government accounting system that was itself undergoing significant change. Consistency between the Northcote-Trevelyan recommendations and ongoing internal initiatives designed to ensure the competence of clerks recruited to undertake accounting work and subsequently applying for promotion to a higher grade is demonstrated. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,,"BPP 1829, vi(a), 1.

In 2005, Afghanistan remained the source of 87% of the world's illicit opium, in spite of ongoing efforts by the Afghan government, the United States, and their international partners to combat poppy cultivation and drug trafficking. U.N. officials estimate that in-country illicit profits from the 2005 opium poppy crop were equivalent in value to 50% of the country's legitimate GDP, sustaining fears that Afghanistan's economic recovery continues to be underwritten by drug profits. Across Afghanistan, regional militia commanders, criminal organizations, and corrupt government officials have exploited opium production and drug trafficking as reliable sources of revenue and patronage, which has perpetuated the threat these groups pose to the country's fragile internal security and the legitimacy of its embryonic democratic government. The trafficking of Afghan drugs also appears to provide financial and logistical support to a range of extremist groups that continue to operate in and around Afghanistan, including remnants of the Taliban regime and some Al Qaeda operatives. Although coalition forces may be less frequently relying on figures involved with narcotics for intelligence and security support, many observers have warned that drug related corruption among appointed and newly elected Afghan officials may create new political obstacles to further progress. The initial failure of U.S. and international counternarcotics efforts to disrupt the Afghan opium trade or sever its links to warlordism and corruption after the fall of the Taliban led some observers to warn that without redoubled multilateral action, Afghanistan would succumb to a state of lawlessness and reemerge as a sanctuary for terrorists. Following his election in late 2004, Afghan president Hamid Karzai identified counternarcotics as the top priority for his administration and since has stated his belief that ""the fight against drugs is the fight for Afghanistan."" In 2005, U.S. and Afghan officials implemented a new strategy to provide viable economic alternatives to poppy cultivation and to disrupt corruption and narco-terrorist linkages. According to a U.N. survey, these new initiatives contributed to a 21% decrease in the amount of opium poppy cultivation across Afghanistan in the 2004-2005 growing season. However, better weather and higher crop yields ensured that overall opium output remained nearly static at 4,100 metric tons. Survey results and official opinions suggest output may rise again in 2006. In addition to describing the structure and development of the Afghan narcotics trade, this report provides current statistical information, profiles the trade's various participants, explores alleged narco-terrorist linkages, and reviews U.S. and international policy responses since late 2001. The report also considers current policy debates regarding the role of the U.S. military in counternarcotics operations, opium poppy eradication, alternative livelihood development, and funding issues for Congress..

Following the new paradigm of famine analysis where focus is placed on political failures, the article addresses three groups of political dynamics that together contributed to the starvation deaths: (i) political triggering mechanisms; (ii) underlying political dynamics; and (iii) village specific political dynamics. The article finds that the government's escalating conflict with the Maoists turned a situation of chronic food insecurity into an acute hunger crisis, which was not mitigated by effective public policies at the local level due to extensive political patronage and a politicisation of the bureaucracy. Amlashol suffered disproportionally from this due to the village's affiliation with a weak and politically marginalised panchayat. Within Amlashol, the casualties of starvation came primarily from one particular Scheduled tribe, the Sabars, due to issues of social stigmatisation, political exclusion and eroding livelihoods. The article provides a testament to the importance of addressing disaggregated political dynamics in contemporary starvation analysis. © 2011 SAGE Publications India Private Limited.","Amlashol; local political dynamics; Starvation deaths; West Bengal",,,,,,,"Five Die in Belpahari Village Due to Starvation and Malnutrition (2004) Anandabazar Patrika, , (loosely translated).10 July; Buddha Orders Inquiry on Starvation Deaths and 30 Doctors Despatched to Amlasol (2004) Anandabazar Patrika, , Minister (Maheswar Murmu) Given the Charge but is yet to Start Probe (loosely translated). 11 July; Party and Administration Desperate to Hide Truth; and Starvation Situation in Amlasol, Admits Buddha (2004) Anandabazar Patrika, , (loosely translated). 12 July; How can We Recognise You, do You Come to Our Village; We dont have Food, Give us Food, Amlasol Tells Minister Maheswar; and The Minister Visits Amlasol for the First Time after the News of Starvation Deaths (2004) Anandabazar Patrika, , (loosely translated). 13 July; (2006) India Human Rights Report 2006-West Bengal, , http://www.achrweb.org/reports/india/AR06/WB.htm, Asian Centre for Human Rights.

The society consists of rich and poor. The rich are initially in power, but expect to transition to democracy, which will choose redistributive policies. Taxation requires the employment of bureaucrats. By choosing an inefficient state structure, the rich may be able to use patronage and capture democratic politics, so reducing the amount of redistribution in democracy. Moreover, the inefficient state creates its own constituency and tends to persist over time. Intuitively, an inefficient state structure creates more rents for bureaucrats than would an efficient one. When the poor come to power in democracy, they will reform the structure of the state to make it more efficient so that higher taxes can be collected at lower cost and with lower rents for bureaucrats. Anticipating this, when the society starts out with an inefficient organization of the state, bureaucrats support the rich, who set lower taxes but also provide rents to bureaucrats. We obtain that the rich-bureaucrats coalition may also expand the size of bureaucracy excessively so as to generate enough political support. The model shows that an equilibrium with an inefficient state is more likely to arise when there is greater income inequality, when bureaucratic rents take intermediate values, and when individuals are sufficiently forward-looking. © 2011 by the European Economic Association.",,,,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Politics and Economics in Weak and Strong States (2005) Journal of Monetary Economics, 52, pp. 1199-1226; Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J.A., Inefficient Redistribution (2001) American Political Science Review, 95, pp. 649-662; Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J.A., (2006) Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, , Cambridge University Press; Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J.A., Persistence of Power, Elites and Institutions (2008) American Economic Review, 98, pp. 267-293; Acemoglu, D., Ticchi, D., Vindigni, A., (2006), Emergence and Persistence of Inefficient States.""

In 2005, Afghanistan remained the source of 87% of the world's illicit opium, in spite of ongoing efforts by the Afghan government, the United States, and their international partners to combat poppy cultivation and drug trafficking. U.N. officials estimate that in-country illicit profits from the 2005 opium poppy crop were equivalent in value to 50% of the country's legitimate GDP, sustaining fears that Afghanistan's economic recovery continues to be underwritten by drug profits. Across Afghanistan, regional militia commanders, criminal organizations, and corrupt government officials have exploited opium production and drug trafficking as reliable sources of revenue and patronage, which has perpetuated the threat these groups pose to the country's fragile internal security and the legitimacy of its embryonic democratic government. The trafficking of Afghan drugs also appears to provide financial and logistical support to a range of extremist groups that continue to operate in and around Afghanistan, including remnants of the Taliban regime and some Al Qaeda operatives. Although coalition forces may be less frequently relying on figures involved with narcotics for intelligence and security support, many observers have warned that drug related corruption among appointed and newly elected Afghan officials may create new political obstacles to further progress. The initial failure of U.S. and international counternarcotics efforts to disrupt the Afghan opium trade or sever its links to warlordism and corruption after the fall of the Taliban led some observers to warn that without redoubled multilateral action, Afghanistan would succumb to a state of lawlessness and reemerge as a sanctuary for terrorists. Following his election in late 2004, Afghan president Hamid Karzai identified counternarcotics as the top priority for his administration and since has stated his belief that -the fight against drugs is the fight for Afghanistan. In 2005, U.S. and Afghan officials implemented a new strategy to provide viable economic alternatives to poppy cultivation and to disrupt corruption and narco-terrorist linkages. According to a U.N. survey, these new initiatives contributed to a 21% decrease in the amount of opium poppy cultivation across Afghanistan in the 2004-2005 growing season. However, better weather and higher crop yields ensured that overall opium output remained nearly static at 4,100 metric tons. Survey results and official opinions suggest output may rise again in 2006. In addition to describing the structure and development of the Afghan narcotics trade, this report provides current statistical information, profiles the trade's various participants, explores alleged narco-terrorist linkages, and reviews U.S. and international policy responses since late 2001. The report also considers current policy debates regarding the role of the U.S. military in counternarcotics operations, opium poppy eradication, alternative livelihood development, and funding issues for Congress.

During the visit, litter of various components is generated. While the management of litter on beaches should be of concern, from the existing literature in Nigeria and other developing world, little is known about it. To this end, this study is aimed at investigating how litter generated on beaches in Lagos, Nigeria is managed. Data for the study reported in this chapter were obtained from two stakeholders (the visitors and beach managers) on a third of the identified beaches. Incidental sampling technique was utilized to obtain information from the visitors. Information was also obtained from two operators/managers in each of the selected beaches. Upon subjecting the data collected from these stakeholders to analysis, the study provided information that 86% of the visitors to the beaches were between the ages of 20 and 55 years and 51.7% were tertiary school leavers. Furthermore, while 43.3% of the visitors patronized beaches on Saturday and Sunday, 45.3% of the visitors who were from diverse occupations were in the low income class earning less than 15000 Naira per month; (155 Naira = $1.00). The most important reason for visiting the beaches was recreational while religious activities ranked third. Distance to homes did not contribute significantly to decisions on a beach to visit. Multiple payments may be made to multiples people who may include beach touts, beach managers and local government officials from rate department per visit. Measuring litter generated on the four beaches through Waste Generation Index (WGI), packaging materials was considered by visitors as the most important component generated. This chapter also reported that both the methods of litter storage and disposal on the four beaches were not environmentally friendly. The method of disposal especially, arranged in order of importance include burning, dumping into the ocean and leaving the litters on where they were generated. The study found that patronage of the beaches will be higher if they have better environmental quality through effective litter management that could evolve through the provision of improved environmental amenities. The study concluded that the framework to evolve effective and efficient litter management can form part of a comprehensively beach management policy guidelines employable in nations with beaches and with similar social, economic, cultural and political situations with Lagos, Nigeria. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In 2005, Afghanistan remained the source of 87% of the world's illicit opium, in spite of ongoing efforts by the Afghan government, the United States, and their international partners to combat poppy cultivation and drug trafficking. U.N. officials estimate that in-country illicit profits from the 2005 opium poppy crop were equivalent in value to 50% of the country's legitimate GDP, sustaining fears that Afghanistan's economic recovery continues to be underwritten by drug profits. Across Afghanistan, regional militia commanders, criminal organizations, and corrupt government officials have exploited opium production and drug trafficking as reliable sources of revenue and patronage, which has perpetuated the threat these groups pose to the country's fragile internal security and the legitimacy of its embryonic democratic government. The trafficking of Afghan drugs also appears to provide financial and logistical support to a range of extremist groups that continue to operate in and around Afghanistan, including remnants of the Taliban regime and some Al Qaeda operatives. Although coalition forces may be less frequently relying on figures involved with narcotics for intelligence and security support, many observers have warned that drug related corruption among appointed and newly elected Afghan officials may create new political obstacles to further progress. The initial failure of U.S. and international counternarcotics efforts to disrupt the Afghan opium trade or sever its links to warlordism and corruption after the fall of the Taliban led some observers to warn that without redoubled multilateral action, Afghanistan would succumb to a state of lawlessness and reemerge as a sanctuary for terrorists. Following his election in late 2004, Afghan president Hamid Karzai identified counternarcotics as the top priority for his administration and since has stated his belief that ""the fight against drugs is the fight for Afghanistan."" In 2005, U.S. and Afghan officials implemented a new strategy to provide viable economic alternatives to poppy cultivation and to disrupt corruption and narco-terrorist linkages. According to a U.N. survey, these new initiatives contributed to a 21% decrease in the amount of opium poppy cultivation across Afghanistan in the 2004-2005 growing season. However, better weather and higher crop yields ensured that overall opium output remained nearly static at 4,100 metric tons. Survey results and official opinions suggest output may rise again in 2006. In addition to describing the structure and development of the Afghan narcotics trade, this report provides current statistical information, profiles the trade's various participants, explores alleged narco-terrorist linkages, and reviews U.S. and international policy responses since late 2001. The report also considers current policy debates regarding the role of the U.S. military in counternarcotics operations, opium poppy eradication, alternative livelihood development, and funding issues for Congress. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The reform bull Pastoralis officii (1513) permanently reserved benefices at the Church of Ss. Celso and Giuliano in Rome, where de' Grassi served as archpriest. Between 1524 and 1551 ceremonialists endowed three private chapels at Ss. Celso and Giuliano; in 1578 another ceremonialist established a chapel at the Church of San Lorenzo in Lucina, where a personal monument did not reference or depend on de' Grassi's legacy. The construction of memorial chapels at Ss. Celso and Giuliano allowed ceremonialists to establish both individual and collected corporate identities and reveals the continued entwining of private and institutional goals in both patronage and the papal bureaucracy.","Church of San Lorenzo in Lucina; Church of Ss.

The Politics of Presidential Appointments examines in depth how and why presidents use political appointees and how their choices impact government performance--for better or worse. One way presidents can influence the permanent bureaucracy is by filling key posts with people who are sympathetic to their policy goals. But if the president's appointees lack competence and an agency fails in its mission--as with Katrina--the president is accused of employing his friends and allies to the detriment of the public. Through case studies and cutting-edge analysis, David Lewis takes a fascinating look at presidential appointments dating back to the 1960s to learn which jobs went to appointees, which agencies were more likely to have appointees, how the use of appointees varied by administration, and how it affected agency performance. He argues that presidents politicize even when it hurts performance--and often with support from Congress--because they need agencies to be responsive to presidential direction. He shows how agency missions and personnel--and whether they line up with the president's vision--determine which agencies presidents target with appointees, and he sheds new light on the important role patronage plays in appointment decisions. © 2008 by Princeton University Press.

From these two separate registers, some anthropologists explain the recurrence and spread of the phenomenon of corruption by a common historical phenomenon of entrenchment of separate registers normative. In other words the principles of the court society precolonial were added, without removing them, the principles of the functioning bureaucracy set up by the French colonization. However, analysis of archives in the area of Bandiagara in Mali shows, on the contrary, the colonial power was never put in place rules of a game.

In 1811, the Kongs were scandalized by revelations that officials of their estate had been accepting contributions of silver from a popular religious association decried as ""heterodox"" by the Qing state. This study of the subsequent investigation reveals the bureaucratic dynamics of anti-corruption cases; provincial officials drove the interrogations to increasingly violent extremes in the search for silver. The unusual arrangement linking the Kong estate to a sectarian organization is also suggestive. While the declining fortunes of the Kongs contributed to an increased motivation to forge patronage relationships with alternative social networks, it also weakened the Kong duke's ability to protect his mansion bureaucracy from intrabureaucratic attack. © 2010 Project MUSE®.",,,,,,,,"Agnew, C.S., (2006) Culture and Power in the Making of the Descendants of Confucius, 1300-1800, , Ph.D. diss., University of Washington; Bartlett, B.S., (1991) Monarchs and Ministers: The Grand Council in Mid-Ch'ing China, 1723-1820, , Berkeley: University of California Press; (1937) Da Qing Li Chao Shi Lu (Veritable Records of the Successive Reigns of the Great Qing), , Xinjing: Da Manzhou diguo guomu yuan; Dan, S., An account of the preliminary organization of the archives of the Kong mansion of Qufu (1956) Wen Wu Cankao Ziliao, 10, pp. 25-27; Dubois, T.D., (2005) The Sacred Village: Social Change and Religious Life in Rural North China, , Honolulu: University of Hawaii; Gaustad, B., Prophets and Pretenders: Inter-sect Competition in Qianlong China (2000) Late Imperial China, 21 (1), pp. 1-40; Harrell, S., Perry, E.J., Syncretic Sects in Chinese Society (1982) Modern China, 8 (3), pp. 283-303. , July; Hummel, A., (1944) Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period, , Washington: US Government Printing Office; (2000) Jiaqing Daoguang Liangchao Shangyu Dang (Archive of Imperial Edicts from the Reigns of Jiaqing and Daoguang), , Ed.

In Cook County and Chicago, the Shakman Decree required the establishment of an antipatronage staffing system to ensure that political considerations did not enter into staffing decisions. Despite the court prohibitions and the antipatronage staffing systems, patronage continued to flourish. A number of unethical and illegal violations included falsifying exam scores and interviews, demanding political contributions for jobs and contracts, and covering up wrongdoing. These patronage abuses led to successful criminal prosecution of a number of individuals. Political influence had a corrupting effect on the government bureaucracy. At a time when many public personnel systems are moving toward at-will employment systems to provide flexibility and responsiveness to the political leaders, this direction might not be in the public's best interest. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","Civil service reform; Government corruption; Patronage; Personnel administration; Staffing systems",,,,,,,"Anechiarico, F., Jacobs, J.B., (1996) The Pursuit of Absolute Integrity: How Corruption Control Makes Government Ineffective, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Bearfield, D.A., What is patronage?

But it has also had the desirable effect of prompting a little more skepticism towards the economic beliefs that have constituted the mainstream view about public economic strategy for the past three decades, both in themajor western states and in international lending organizations like the World Bank and the IMF. They have at their core the proposition that 'government failure is generally worse than market failure', which supports the default policy setting of 'more free market' in most countries most of the time. The new crisis-induced skepticism is good news because the previous confidence rested more on what J. S. Mill called 'the deep slumber of a settled opinion' than on a solid empirical base. The present article begins by summarizing some powerful pieces of evidence that challenge core mainstream propositions in the context of developing countries, which have received less attention than they deserve. Having shown why the mainstream prescription for the role of government in development is questionable, the article describes some key points about the nature of industrial policy in East Asia and about the general rationale for a certain kind of industrial policy even where state capacity is relatively weak. The rationale is all the stronger in the world economy after the crisis, when a major surge of innovation around energy, water, nanotechnology and genetics is likely, rendering many existing specializations unviable. The article then presents an argument about the institutional arrangements of a 'developmental state' through which national strategies can be formed and implemented. It ends by describing small signs of new flexibility in World Bank and IMF thinking. Policy Implications: • Liberalizing markets, attracting FDI and promoting good governance are not necessary conditions of long-term economic growth and development in low-income countries. • In the wake of the global financial crisis and the impending surge of new technologies, the role of industrial policy - promoting some sectors or products ahead of others - should be expanded. • Import replacement as well as export orientation are crucial components of a successful industrial policy. • Four organizational features are important in a developmental state: (1) an even balance between the state and business groups; (2) a public service mindset among state officials; (3) delivery of patronage resources separately from the economic bureaucracy; and (4) an industrial extension service, with tight limits on its officials' discretionary control of resources. • Developing country governments and firms should be prepared to push back against the shrinking latitude for industrial policy instruments allowed in international trade and investment agreements. © 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Allen, G.C., Advice from Economists - Forty-Five Years Ago (1975) Three Banks Review, 106, pp. 35-50; Amsden, A.H., (2001) The Rise of the Rest: Challenges to the West from Late-Industrialization Economies, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Beattie, A., Ownership is Not the Real Problem with China (2007) Financial Times, , 16 April; Chang, H.-J., (2009), Industrial Policy: Can we Go beyond an Unproductive Confrontation?'

The “sacred” argue that Bangladesh was founded on Islam as its ideology, as the state creation cannot be separated from 1947, and therefore, it does not have a secular future. The “secularist” insists that the 1971 liberation war and the fact that Bangladesh broke away from the Islamic state of Pakistan affirms its secular future. Within this contested space, a legacy of highly divisive political culture has been nurtured which makes the politics in Bangladesh a zero sum game and reduces its capacity to fight Islamist extremism and terrorism in an effective manner. This political culture also has a historical legacy. Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, known as the father of the nation, who shaped Bangladesh’s political destiny after its liberation, made secularism one of the founding principles of Bangladesh and General Zia-ur-Rahman, former Army Chief of Staff who became the President of Bangladesh and founder of the Bangladesh National Party amended its secular constitution, legalized religious parties and changed Bengali nationalism from an ethno-linguistic identity to Bangladeshi nationalism, a religion-based identity. Reconciliation between various groups, especially, the groups that considered themselves as liberators of Bangladesh from the “occupation forces” and collaborators - the religious party members who helped the Pakistan Army against the war of liberation - have made cooperation between the two main political contenders impossible. Therefore, one sees a polarized polity that is divided between the left oriented parties - the Awami League and other communist parties - and the centre right, the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and the religious parties. The religious parties were banned in 1972. However, Sheikh Mujib’s assas- sination paved the way for the legitimization of religious political parties for two reasons. First, Zia needed the help of the rightist elements to legitimize his rule and second, his Bangladeshi nationalism created a space for the religious political parties to play a role in the propagation and consolidation of this nationalism cradled in religion. Since 1977, the religious political parties have played important role in shaping the role of religion in Bangladesh’s politics. The political discourse of religious political parties has helped smaller religious groups to grow and at times with their patronage but providing it with radical spin that gives space to radicalized debate. The Islamic political parties, stigmatized for their role in the liberation war, spread their network especially after 1990 with the restoration of democracy. In the 1980s, the religious political parties were consolidating their organization which was in disarray following the ban on them. Jamaat Islami was the most prominent party. However, other Islamic parties like the Muslim League and Nizam-e-Mushtafa were politically present. After the 1979 Iranian revolution, the Ulemma tried to play a politically more visible role by floating parties like Khilafat Andolan and later in 1990 Islami Shansontantra Andolan. Jihad became a catch-word against oppression and tyranny and was posed as the most successful instrument, particularly after the disintegration of the erstwhile Soviet Union. And the religious political parties in Bangladesh could not remain immune to this call for jihad as some of these religious parties helped in dispatching jihadis to fight in Afghanistan. The ultra-radical Taliban regime in Afghanistan and their politico-religious success epitomized the ideal of a state governed by Shariat - a prospect of prototype Iran. It needs to be mentioned that some of the Jamaat leaders had played an important role in training and indoctrinating Bangladeshis who were willing to fight in Afghanistan. Some of the trained Mujahideen returned in 1990 and vowed to turn Bangladesh into Afghanistan by becoming the Bangladeshi Taliban. The social and political bases for resurgence of radical Islam had already been germinated during long period of military rule which patronized the religious political parties and co-opted them. Therefore, the confirmation of the existence of various Islamic groups was matter of time. Organizations like Harkat-ul-Jihadi-Islam (HuJI) were created by these Afghan-returned warriors also known as Bangladeshi Taliban. In 1998, its leader Fazlur Rahman along with Osama bin Laden signed a document declaring “holy war” against the USA. Other organizations like the Ahl-e-Hadith Andolan Bangladesh (AHAB), which professes Wahhabi ideology, spread its network through generous funding from the Middle Eastern countries and later the Jamaat-ulMujaheedin Bangladesh (JMB) also spread its network in Bangladesh. Though HuJI has a transnational network and is aligned to various other groups in India and is fighting with a pan-Islamic agenda, groups like the AHAB and JMB are more focused on Bangladesh and want Bangladesh, which is a Muslim majority country, to be ruled by Shariat. The JMB earlier had come into media attention in 2003 when some of its members were arrested in Chittagong while undergoing training. However, the government had ignored the report and later these people were freed as the police failed to produce any evidence against them. The spread and network of JMB was evident when this obscure organization orchestrated 459 bomb blasts across 63 districts out of 64 in a matter of half an hour on 17 August 2005. The subsequent suicide killings, first of their kind in Bangladesh, attested to the dangers of Islamist militancy in Bangladesh. Institutional affiliation of these groups to Middle East based Islamic NGOs reveals its extra-regional linkages. Repeated denial by the government and its extreme reluctance to take action against these groups in spite of media reports helped the extremist elements to strengthen their network. For example, in 2004, the media also reported Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB) that was involved in vigilante activities against the sarboharas with the patronage of the ruling parties and the government rejected these reports outright. The Jamaat and Islami Oikya Jote’s (IOJ) presence in the government as alliance partner helped the Islamists, as it deterred any action against them. To deal with the media criticism at one point in time, the government went to the extent of saying that the reports on extremism were a media creation and were meant to tarnish the image of Bangladesh and undermine the efforts of the BNP-led alliance government to promote good governance. Political rhetoric blaming one party or the other for militancy limited the scope of further enquiry. The politically motivated bureaucracy - divided along party lines with strong ideological afinity - further eroded the chance of any further investigation on this matter and the matter remained in limbo. The police force helped the JMJB operations against the radical left and the administrative machinery provided full support to the militants by providing logistical support to the meetings addressed by Bangla Bhai. The police claimed that the JMJB was helping them in maintaining law and order, which is a poor reflection on the state of affiairs of the law-enforcing apparatus. This nexus with the BNP government further emboldened the Islamists. The government, dependent on donors, did not wish its image of a “moderate Muslim” country to be tarnished. It accused India of playing an aggressive role along with the Awami League to prove Bangladesh a failed state without going into the causes of militancy and its links with some of the Cabinet Ministers.1 Another problem was the emergence of a shadow government under the active patronage and support of Tarique Rahman, son of former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia. These young generations of politicians supported the BNP’s alliance with the Jamaat for sheer electoral calculations. In spite of their reported linkages with radical elements Tarique Rahman and his young coterie were reluctant to part ways with them, thus creating a division within the BNP. Moreover, Jamaat’s ascendancy to power and BNP’s dependency on it for political survival strengthened the power of the religious right. This chapter examines the factors that helped in the rise of Islamist militancy, the organizational structure of the militant groups, their network and transnational linkages. It also analyses the future of radical Islam in Bangladesh in the context of global war on terror and growth of radical Islam in general. © 2011 K.

As decentralization became more widespread in the developing world in the 1980s and 1990s, it ignited a great deal of scholarly attention on the economic viability of federalism. One of the most salient, mostly unchallenged, theses about this question traces the superiority of decentralization to normative economic thinking on federalism. Drawing on Charles Tiebout’s (1956) work, it is argued that decentralization limits the ability of government officials to supply local goods on political grounds. In this light, Barry Weingast (1995) developed the concept of market-preserving federalism to connote systems in which decentralized control over the economy by subnational governments within a common market precludes the central government from encroaching on the political and economic rights of its citizens. This arrangement, the argument goes, underpins fiscal responsibility, providing no incentives for the constituent parts to overuse the common pool of federal economic resources. In recent years, however, as the “desirability” of federalism has burst upon the scene as a subject of interest to scholars and policy-makers, Weingast’s assumptions have come under criticism (Rodden and Ackerman 1997). Perhaps the most important common thread running through these works is that normative public choice theories largely ignore the role of bureaucracy and the political framework in which intergovernmental decisions are taken. Put differently, Weingast’s theoretical roadmap fails to account for the poor fiscal performance of many federal states such as India and the large Latin American federal states of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, let alone the Russian experience which kindled a cacophony of epithets such as market-distorting federalism (Slider 1997) and market-hampering federalism (Zhuravskaya 2000). The major alternative approach to assessing the putative advantages of federalism through a political economy framework has been that of normative studies on the concept of representation. Early normative approaches, such as that to be found in the seminal works of Moffet (1895) and Merriam (1931), tended to view the institutional underpinnings of federalism as decisive in guaranteeing fair legislative decision-making in multi-tiered polities. Extolling the virtues of the US Great Compromise (i.e. the decision to grant each state equal representation in the Senate), this scholarship has emphasized that particular principles or structures of government are necessary conditions to be present in any federal system. Namely, every federation must have a second chamber in the legislature representing the regions and this chamber should be safeguarded against the potential hegemony of the larger subnational units in the federation. Advocates of this perspective praise equal representation in the second (i.e. upper, territorial) chamber as a check on the tyranny of the majority, drawing on the spirit of The Federalist Papers and suggesting that legislative overrepresentation reinforces pluralism (Elazar 1987: 102-104; Morley 1959). However, as Burgess (2006: 205) claims, overrepresentation in the territorial chamber is the exception rather than the rule in modern federations (excluding the highly overrepresented Senates in Argentina, Brazil and, to a much lesser extent, Australia), let alone that studies on US federalism cast doubt on the benefits of Senate overrepresentation in terms of low levels of party competition in many states, inequitable distribution of state transportation and education funds, and a failure to adopt or expand social welfare programs, among others (Lee and Oppenheimer 1999: 4). More critically, as I will seek to show in this chapter, most scholarship of a normative nature has failed to provide empirical grounds to support their advocacy of non-proportional legislative representation. The analytical challenge, then, is to develop a theory of comparative federal fiscal performance based on how the institutional structure of federalism provides incentives for political officials at all levels of government. Surprisingly, few scholars have focused on this central question in the study of comparative federalism. The first notable exception is the research undertaken by Wibbels (2005), showing that intergovernmental partisan harmony achieved via coattails is the most important factor to extend market reform to the subnational governments in the developing world. This situation arises when the national government can rely on copartisans at the regional level not as a result of centralized control or the use of sticks and carrots, but rather as the basis for intergovernmental coordination of policies. Another study addressing the subject matter even more directly is Braun et al.‘s (2002) analysis of the influence of federalism on fiscal policy making. They conclude that intergovernmental veto powers, namely whether the federal or subnational governments have the upper hand in the design of fiscal policies, are decisive to explain policy outputs such as budget deficits. Third, Rodden (2006)‘s study on the perils of fiscal federalism shows that subnational governments can spend well beyond their means because the structure of federalism shifts bailout decisions away from bank regulators and technocrats and turns national legislatures into king-makers when it comes to the control of subnational fiscal profligacy. Stressing the role of electoral externalities, Rodden claims that state politicians will only ponder about the national consequences of their fiscal policies when their electoral fate is tied to that of their federal-level counterparts. Persuasive as the above-mentioned works are, they fall short of theorizing institutional complexity in federal systems as a result of their omission of the theoretically unwieldy topic of legislative malapportionment. As suggested above, beyond the normative issue of whether this built-in overrepresentation in federal systems is necessary, an extensive empirical literature confirms that legislative malapportionment has not only a decisive effect on the coalition-building efforts of executives at the central and subnational level but also substantial and direct consequences on public policy (USA: Ansolabehere et al. 2002; Atlas et al. 1995; Argentina: Gibson and Calvo 2000; Germany: Pitlik et al. 2005; European Union: Rodden 2002a). The logic is simple: because overrepresented, sparsely populated, economically vulnerable jurisdictions can be co-opted in the legislate process at the least cost and hence offer more “political bang for the buck”, public spending and distributive politics will be biased in favor of said entities. While there is no shortage of empirical evidence to establish that malapportionment “matters”, this chapter argues that the major challenge is to develop, or refine existing, theoretical tools to map out the precise institutional incentives at play. Above all, if malapportionment is to have a causal effect on fiscal policies, it is of essence to unravel its dynamic relationship with its most proximate correlates, namely socio-demographic and economic conditions, electoral rules and party politics. How does malapportionment affect the regional disparities that politicize the federal budgetary process? By increasing the number of small, overrepresented jurisdictions, do malapportioned electoral rules induce federal partisan biases? These questions indicate how difficult it is to disentangle federalism from other institutional variables such as the electoral and party systems and the importance of analyzing federalism within the broader political system in which it is embedded. As a central parameter in the design of federal institutions, the biased apportionment of seats to national legislative bodies highlights the tension between the empowerment of subnational actors (and the concomitant enhancement of democratic accountability) and the accompanying possibilities for clientelistic and rent-seeking behavior. Put differently, the unintended consequence of compensating underpopulated, oftentimes poorer, jurisdictions for their disadvantaged position is their over-empowerment to tilt federal policies beyond social welfare criteria. Thus, I claim that a progressive, normativeladen, overrepresentation of small jurisdictions often results in regressive, social welfare-detrimental, pork barrel fiscal policies. Aside from this chapter’s contribution to the intergovernmental fiscal relations literature, I seek to engage in the broad theoretical debate in comparative politics about the role of institutions in shaping political and economic outcomes. Particularly, this research aims to underscore how federal institutions may at times undermine the normative purposes for which they were designed in the first place. The overrepresentation of the smallest units, which is the cornerstone of the US Great Compromise, not only empowers the legislators of these units to coalesce in demanding policy concessions at the expense of the populous states, but may also generate sub-optimal outcomes in terms of fair economic distribution and performance. Consequently, instead of taking federal institutions as given, I show that whether they help effective policy-making to accommodate territorially based political and economic differences is ultimately an empirical question. In this regard, one common theme throughout this chapter is that while institutions themselves become loci of political contestation, the power asymmetries documented in this study are not likely to disappear unless reforms of Senate apportionment take effect. Considering the multiplicity of entrenched interests hindering institutional reforms and thus in light of the apparent endurance of legislative overrepresentation, the failure to elaborate a systematic understanding of its effects has more than academic implications. In what follows, I discuss these topics analytically, hoping to highlight heretofore largely unforeseen and counter-intuitive aspects of the impact of legislative overrepresentation on intergovernmental fiscal relations. This discussion is complemented with preliminary evidence from Argentina, a federation exhibiting one of the most decentralized fiscal systems in the world and featuring severe imbalances in the territorial distribution of legislative and economic resources. © 2010 Selection and editorial matter, Jan Erk and Wilfried Swenden; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,,,,,9781135228927; 9780415548441,,,"English","New Directions in Federalism Studies",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122363759

But these changes are far from being unambiguous. In 1987, Yves Mény insisted that, despite being commonly considered as “the prototype of centralization” (1987: 88), the French system of relations between centre and periphery has always been more complex than commonly thought. Two aspects were particularly underscored: first, the strong presence of the “local” at the central level and the persistence of “localist” values in the French political culture; and second, the ability of local actors to tame central influence in daily negotiations on public policy implementation (Grémion 1976). Socio-historical researches (Politix 2001) have shown that the birth of the republican regime in late-nineteenth-century France did not simply involve the imposition of new rules by the centre on peripheries. Rather, the consolidation of the regime was the result of the colonisation of the centre by local republican “notables” and “petites patries” (Chanet 1996), with the commune seen as the cradle of republican values. The later reinforcement of the central state and of ministerial bureaucracies, especially with the creation of the Fifth Republic in 1958, never really marginalised local actors in central and local policy-making processes (Tarrow 1977). Paradoxically, the impression of a strong centralisation was also due to the Jacobinism of local politicians, and especially of mayors, who considered the local interest a mere reflection of the general interest defined centrally (Borraz 1998), which they helped forge thanks to the multiple officeholding system. But these same politicians who helped reinforce central state legitimacy were also actively trying to preserve local interests. Thus, the functioning of the French local political system was so far from the stereotype of a highly centralised country that the relevance of the centreperiphery framework was increasingly questioned even before the Decentralisation Acts of the early 1980s. Recent developments allow ambiguity to persist. It is tempting to suggest that two waves of decentralisation (1982-1983 and 2004), the assault of globalisation and EU institutionalisation on the central state, and the localisation of economic interactions (Balme 1996) have definitively made the local government level the more vivid, legitimate, efficient and influential scale of government, along with the regions, at the expense of départements and the central national state. The actual situation is more complicated, for three main reasons. First, the fate of the different levels constituting the three-tier system of French local government (communes, départements, regions) is determined both by deep economic and social change, and - perhaps mainly - by political inflexions and strategies at the central level (Pinson and Le Galès 2005). From this perspective, the French central state’s strategy for territorial reorganisation and decentralisation has fluctuated considerably during the past two decades, owing to political and ideological change or to opportunistic considerations. Second, the trend of territorial reorganisation is unclear, because in a three-tier system in which none of the three components exerts a form of tutelage over the others, each tier is tempted to play its own cards in the reorganisation process, which is a competitive game with uncertain outcomes and which potentially differs from one local or regional situation to another. Outcomes are even more uncertain when the central state’s “favourites” change from one election to another. Twenty-five years after the first Decentralisation Acts, it is no easier to say which level has won the great game of political authority redistribution than it was in 1987 (Fontaine 2007; Zeller 2006). Third, this great difference in the balance between different levels of local or regional bodies is reinforced by the fact that at each individual level, and particularly at the municipal level, the past two decades reveal a powerful process of internal differentiation. There have always been differences between a small rural commune with a population of less than 100 and one with a million inhabitants, despite the fact that French law makes no distinction between them. But there were also similarities. In both cases the capacity to address problems largely depended on access to central government resources, programmes and funds. In both cases the mayor was a key person whose capacity to act was linked to his ability to mobilise political connections to obtain resources. Vertical relationships were more important than horizontal networking, owing to the concentration of resources at the centre. This situation has changed radically, but it still varies considerably between places. In large, thriving cities, a pluralist political landscape has emerged, resources are dispersed and state field services are no longer the dominant actors (Pinson 2006). These pluralist situations require intergovernmental arrangements (Goldsmith 2004), among which inter-municipal institutions are the prominent feature. These arrangements have changed political styles and relationships, helping the rise of a capacity for metropolitan collective action. Elsewhere, in rural areas, in declining medium-sized towns, inter-municipal cooperation is much more difficult, since each individual commune is tempted to put itself under the patronage of a superior tier, the département or the state. Mény (1987: 90) noted that the appearance and deepening of an urban-rural cleavage was one of the clearest features in the evolution of French territorial organisation between 1945 and 1985. By 2007, with the rise of influential collective powers (“pouvoirs d’agglomération”) in big cities, the landscape of communal power had become even more varied and increasingly differentiated. © 2010 Michael J.

In particular, it describes how local political and administrative structures affect the scope of citizen participation in the governance and decision-making processes of CBHOs. This is an important topic since these organisations implement housing and community development programmes in urban neighbourhoods, and citizen participation has been considered important to the legitimacy of these efforts. The analysis is based on in-depth interviews with CBHO executive directors in Buffalo, New York. In particular, the executive directors of CBHOs that concentrate their efforts on the management, development and rehabilitation of affordable housing were interviewed. In addition to data from in-depth interviews, data from fieldnotes, the US census, IRS 990 forms and informal conversations with local government officials and representatives of intermediary organisations were used in the analysis. Existing theories concerning citizen participation and non-profit administration are elaborated upon and applied to CBHOs. The extent to which these organisations create opportunities for grassroots planning is considered and recommendations for expanding citizen participation are proposed. © 2009 Urban Studies Journal Limited.",,"bureaucracy; decision making; grassroots level; local participation; nonprofit organization; urban housing; North America; United States",,,,,,"Alinsky, S., (1969) Reveille for Radicals, , New York: Vintage Books; Arnstein, S.R., A ladder of citizen participation (1969) Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 35 (4), pp. 216-224; Betancur, J.J., Gill, D.C., Community development in Chicago: From Harold Washington to Richard M.

Modern-day patronage is strongly related to two popular efforts to reform government: the rollback of the civil service system and the privatization of government services. These reforms, aimed at reducing the negative outcomes of bureaucracy, have had the unfortunate outcome of eliminating policies designed to protect civil servants from patronage politics and thus of ultimately reducing democratic accountability. Whether the main cause is forgetfulness about the past or simply the application of misguided principles, the dismantling of the civil service and increasing reliance on private contractors can endanger public values and the ability to engage in a thoughtful debate about public values. Professionalism in government—including civil service, open competition for jobs and contracts, and merit systems—remains the most effective and just means for combating patronage and identifying talented, dedicated public servants and contractors. © 2008, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Alford, J., Why Do Public-Sector Clients Coproduce?

Yet these arguments lose their force when applied to state and local civil service systems. In many states and localities limited media scrutiny, limited political competition, the weakness of existing bureaucracies, and a relative tolerance for spoils-oriented patronage make radical civil service reform risky. We develop a ranking predicting which states make the best and worst candidates for radical civil service reform. State level independent variables include corruption, traditional party organizations, media capacity, party competition, and bureaucratic capacity.","Civil service reform; Public personnel management; Spoils system; State government reform; State politics",,,,,,,"Barr, S., New personnel systems have much in common (2005) Washington Post, pp. C2; Van Riper, P.P., (1958) History of the United States Civil Service, , Row, Peterson, Evanston, IL; Callow, A., (1966) The Tweed Ring, , Oxford University Press, London; Weko, T.J., (1995) The Politicizing Presidency, , University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS; Brewer, G.A., Maranto, R., Comparing the roles of political appointees and career executives in the U.S. federal executive branch (2000) American Review of Public Administration, 30 (1), pp. 69-86; Rauch, J., (1999) Government's End: Why Washington Stopped Working, p. 295. , Public Affairs, New York; Anechiarico, F., Jacobs, J.B., The Pursuit of Absolute Integrity, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Savas, E.S., (2000) Privatization and Public-private Partnerships, , Chatham House Publishers, New York; Lasseter, R.W., Georgia's merit system reform 1996-2001: An operating agency's perspective (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22 (2), pp. 125-133; (2002) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 22 (1), pp. 3-26. , Hamilton; Fenton, J.H., (1966) Midwest Politics, , Holt, Rinehart, & Winston, New York; Elazar, D.J., (1972) American Federalism: A View from the State, , Harper & Row, New York; Mayhew, D.R., (1986) Placing Parties in American Politic, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Barone, M., Cohen, R.E., (2003) The Almanac of American Politics: 2004, , National Journal Group, Washington, DC; Sorauf, F.J., (1963) Party and Representation, , Atherton, New York; Kerbel, M.R., (2000) If It Bleeds, It Leads: An Anatomy of Television, , Westview Press, Boulder, CO; Boylan, R.T., Long, C.X., A survey of state house reporters' perception of public corruption (2003) State Politics & Policy Quarterly, 3 (4), pp. 420-439; Ingraham, P.W., Joyce, P.G., Donahue, A.K., (2003) Government Performance: Why Management Matters?, pp. 72-73. , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore; Stanton, M., (2003) The Prince of Providence: The True Story of Buddy Cianci, America's Most Notorious Mayor, Some Wiseguys, and the Feds, , Random House, New York; Unger, N.C., (2000) Fighting Bob La Follette: The Righteous Reformer, , North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, NC",,,,,,,,01900692,,,,"English","Int.

It has been nothing more than a continuous effort to recreate ex nihilo a homogeneous public service at the European level. The Spanish tradition of instability, of permanent conflict between political factions, of the selling of public jobs and, finally, our typical ‘spoils system’, were not the best foundations for the establishment of a professional modern civil service. On the other hand, the public employees affected by the spoils system were always a group interested in the fall of the government, which had been the cause of their spoil retirement, and this situation certainly did not contribute to political stability. Favouritism and patronage were the principal means of recruiting and organising the civil service and political class. In these circumstances of instability and protectionism, some civil servants monopolised the exercise of the authority of the state, including fundamental public tasks such as the budget, tax policy or public works. This situation of monopoly was intimately connected with the knowledge and experience that only these public officials had, which enabled them to enjoy stability against the instability of the other public officials and also to achieve an ius singulare as a legal base of their situation. This circumstance made it possible for certain groups of public officials, due to their professional competence, their political affiliations, the importance of their functions and their group solidarity, to create special corps, from which some became powerful members of the political class, crystallising into an elite structure which has remained until now. © 2001 B.Guy Peters and Jon Pierre for selection and editorial matter; individual contributors their contribution.

This is followed by several comparisons that are established between the characteristics of the relationship between the political and administrative spheres in India and those of the system for naming people for high level positions in Brazil, taking Rio de Janeiro as our example. We argue that both the logic of the transfer system in India and the system through which people are named for high level positions in Brazil maintain legitimacy insofar as they allow ideas linked to administrative efficiency and combating corruption to be used in justifying decisions that are often motivated by political, economic and electoral interests. We also argue that analyses of the relationship between politics and public administration in both countries should not only take the design of political and electoral institutions and the postulate of electoral rationality into account but also the values that were developed throughout the process in which political institutions and public bureaucracies were constituted.","Brazil; High level positions; Indian; Nominations; Patronage; Political system; Public administration",,,,,,,"AMES, B., (2003) Os entraves da democracia no Brasil, , Rio de Janeiro: FGV; BAILEY, F.G., Parliamentary Government in Orissa, 1947-1959 (1962) Journal of Commonwealth Political Studies, 1 (1), pp. 112-122. , May; BAILEY, F.G., (1959) Politics and Social Change, , Orissa, Berkeley: University of California; BAILEY, F.G., (2001) Stratagems and Spoils: A Social Anthropology of Politics, , Boulder: Westview; BANDIK, D., The Transfer Raj: Indian Civil Servants on the Move (2001) The European Journal of Development Research, 13 (1), pp. 106-134. , Bonn, v, June; BEZERRA, M.O., (1995) Corrupção, , Rio de Janeiro: Relume-Dumará; BEZERRA, M.O., (1999) Em nome das bases, , Rio de Janeiro: Relume-Dumará; BHATNAGAR, S., Civil Services and Corruption (1991) Corruption in Indian Politics and Bureaucracy, , BHATNAGAR, S. & SHARMA, S.

Traditional Thai bureaucratic culture is characterized by patrimonialism, departmentalism and legal proceduralism, with bureaucratic power and status legitimized by myths and symbols of service to the monarchy. But the realities of bureaucratic performance (including corruption) have provided a strong stimulus for reform. Since the 1990s, reforms have been strongly influenced by New Public Management (NPM), albeit in a bureaucratic environment hostile to their imposition. International institutions such as the IMF were instrumental in introducing some of the new ideas. Under the governments of Thaksin Shinawatra, such reforms (selectively applied) gained pace due to the imposition of a clear political purpose: centralization of decision-making power (including patronage) in the hands of Thaksin and his immediate circle. The impact of these waves of reform was softened by a combination of the power of bureaucratic conservatives and by their association at first with 'foreign' forces and later with the 'political excesses' of Thaksin. The recent military coup and its aftermath represent a revival of some aspects of Thailand's bureaucratic traditions and hence an interruption to the globalizing, modernizing trajectory of the reforms.",,,,,,,,"Hongladarom, C., Isarankura, W., Raksasap, S., Panipat-Greer, S., Thailand (1998) The Growing Sector, pp. 172-173. , Gus Edgren ed, New Delhi, ILO; Guy Peters, B., (2004) Institutional Theory in Political Science: The New Institutionalism, , 2e édition, Londres, Continuum; Samudavanija, C.-A., The Bureaucracy (1987) Government and Politics of Thailand, pp. 75-107. , Somsakdi Xuto ed, Oxford, Oxford University Press; La loi sur la fonction publique actuellement en vigueur a été adoptée en 1992; Une restructuration intervenue en 2002 a fait passer ce nombre de 126 à 143 voir plus loin; D'importantes personnalités de l'entourage du roi ont joué un rôle de premier plan dans le coup d'état de septembre 2006, ce qui montre bien que cette instance du dispositif institutionnel thaïlandais n'a pas que des fonctions rituelles ou symboliques; Wilson, D.A., (1962) Politics in Thailand, p. 277. , Ithaca, Cornell University Press; Samudavanija, C.-A., The Bureaucracy, p. 95. , cité, p; Riggs, F.W., (1966) Thailand: The Modernization of a Bureaucratic Polity, pp. 312-313. , Honolulu, East-West Center Press; Selon James Ockey, cette analyse « simplifiait la politique thaïlandaise de façon séduisante mais trompeuse.

This article expands our understanding of state feminist institutions in non-democracies by examining the development of a women's national machinery in Cameroon. It argues that the Cameroonian state has adopted a national machinery because: (1) it provides low-cost international legitimacy; (2) it attracts international assistance; (3) this assistance fuels domestic patronage networks; and (4) the national machinery channels women's activism toward state-delineated projects and goals. These motives undercut its ability to promote women's advancement. National machineries in authoritarian contexts are not just plagued by technical problems and funding shortages but also by competing agendas within the state apparatus and a lack of a commitment by high-level government officials to improving women's status in society. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Authoritarianism; Cameroon; Clientelism; National machinery; State feminism",,,,,,"Asian Development Bank, ADB; United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA; United Nations Development Programme, UNDP","Ahanda, J.M., Plaidoyer pour les femmes (1997) Cameroon Tribune, , 10 October; Aubrey, L., Gender, Development, and Democratization in Africa (2001) Journal of African and Asian Studies, 36 (1), pp. 87-111; Baldez, L., Coalition Politics and the Limits of State Feminism in Chile (2001) Women and Politics, 22 (4), pp. 10-28; Brand, L., (1998) Women, the State, and Political Liberalization: Middle Eastern and North African Experiences, , New York: Columbia University Press; Byrne, B., Laier, J.K., Baden, S., Marcus, R., National Machineries for Women in Development: Experiences, Lessons and Strategies for Institutionalising Gender in Development Policy and Planning (1996) Report No. 36, , Report prepared for the European Commission, Directorate General for Development (DGVIII), Bridge Development-Gender; Tribune, C., (2003) La Promotion de la Femme Demeure l'Un des Axes Majeures du Programme Politique du Septennat; Cameroon Tribune, pp. 4-5. , 11 December; (2003) La Répartition de l'Enveloppe Budgétaire, , Cameroon Tribune 2004; Le discours du président-candidat hier à Monatélé (2004) Cameroon Tribune; (1993) Directory of National Machinery for the Advancement of Women, , DAWN, Vienna, Austria: DAWN; Essomba, E., Le candidat Paul Biya: Plaidoyer pour un nouveau contrat de confiance (1997) Cameroon Tribune, , 6 October; Franceschet, S., State Feminism and Women's Movements: The Impact of Chile's Servicio Nacional de la Mujer on Women's Activism' (2003) Latin American Research Review, 38 (1), pp. 9-40; Friedman, E., State-Based Advocacy for Gender Equality in the Developing World: Assessing the Venezuelan National Women's Agency' (2000) Women and Politics, 21 (2), pp. 47-80; Goetz, A.M., National Women's Machinery: State-Based Institutions to Advocate for Gender Equality (2003) Mainstreaming Gender, Democratizing the State?

At the crossroads of the history of institutions and administrative practices and personnel, the present study elucidates the special characteristics of institutional patronage and cronyism and explores the role they play in work relations. In the first part, the author makes reference to work relations specific to Muscovite chancelleries (prikazy) at the end of the seventeenth century; then, she evokes the main measures of Peter I's reform of central government agencies and points to what impact on hierarchical work relations the reformer expected them to have; lastly, she analyses the reasons for and effects of the opposition of certain senior officials to these measures. The second part deals with the period between 1725 and the 1780s and reveals that behind the smooth façade of Petrine institutions, relations of the ancient type still prevailed. In the last part, which focuses on the reign of Catherine II, the author pinpoints the early stages of a significant evolution in the way senior and junior officials viewed the nature of hierarchical relations, and gives her interpretation of the various causes of those changes.",,,,,,,,"Troickij, S.M., (1974) Russkij Absoljutizm i Dvorjanstvo v XVIIi Veke: Formirovanie Bjurokratii [l'Absolutisme Russe et la Noblesse Au XVIIIe Siècle : l'Émergence d'Une Bureaucratie], , M.: Nauka; Demidova, N.F., (1987) Služilaja Bjurokratija v Rossii XVIi Veka i Ee Rol' v Formirovanii Absoljutizma [Bureaucratie de Service en Russie du XVIIe Siècle et Son Rôle dans l'Émergence de l'Absolutisme], , Nauka; Pintner, W., The Evolution of Civil Officialdom, 1755-1855 (1980) Russian Officialdom: The Bureaucratization of Russian Society from the Seventeenth to the Twentieth Century, pp. 190-226. , Walter Pintner et Don Karl Rowney, eds, Chapel Hill; Ransel, D., Bureaucracy and Patronage: The View from an Eighteenth-century Russian Letter-writer (1973) The Rich, the Well-born, and the Powerful: Studies of Elites and Upper Classes in History, pp. 154-178. , Frederic Jaher, ed, Urbana: University of Illinois Press; Ma̧cZak, A., Character and Style of Patron-client Relations in Russia (1988) Klientelsysteme im Europa der Frühen Neuzeit, pp. 211-231. , Münich: R.

It uses a case study of Sri Lanka's attempt to inculcate the value of impartiality in staffing, focusing on the restoration of the independence of the Service Commissions. The article concludes that values-based management is likeliest to succeed in the public sector, whose democratic legitimacy allows politicians to impose values in the form of behavioural norms. Ironically, such management is more complicated in the NGO sector, whose uncertain legitimacy means that managers must negotiate values with staff who may have competing values of their own.

Its growth has been facilitated by the inclusion of private health care development in planning policies, by symbolic encouragement by government officials, by state patronage through medical education and training, by public sector physicians being allowed to practise privately, and by the provision of grants, subsidies and funds for investment. Opportunities for its expansion have also been created by a host of problems in the public health care system, including an inability to provide services, limited resources, poor perception and poor quality of services, a lack of personnel, absenteeism, corruption, and poor planning and management. But complains are also levelled against the private sector, as it lacks necessary infrastructure, equipment and personnel, with poor service conditions, poor quality and poor standards. The government enacted an Ordinance to regulate private health care, but evidence shows that regulatory practices are ineffective as a result of problems of legislative design, information and implementation, as well as internal and external contradictions within the regulatory system. Some policy guidelines are necessary to ensure positive outputs from the private health care sector. © Copyright 2007 Taylor and Francis Group LLC.",,,,,,,,"(2002) Doctors Urged to Be More Sympathetic to Patients, p. 21. , The Daily Star, August, Dhaka; Statistical Year Book of Bangladesh Dhaka: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (1986) Dhaka, , Ministry of Planning, Government of Bangladesh; Bhuiyan, M., (2004) Ethical Business Development in Bangladesh Following the Japanese Business Philosophy, , http://www.bd.emb-japan.go.jp/MBHUIYAN.pdf; Chaudhury, N., Hammer, J.S., (2003) Ghost Doctors: Absenteeism in Bangladesh Health Facilities, , Dhaka, World Bank; Chowdhury, Z., (1995) The Politics of Essential Drugs: The Making of a Successful Health Strategy Lesson from Bangladesh, , London, Zed Book; (1998) Bangladesh Health Bulletin, p. 1996. , Dhaka, Directorate General of Health Services; Personal Communication (2004) Dhaka, , Unified Management Information System, DGHS; (1973) First Five Year Plan, pp. 1973-1978. , Dhaka, Planning Commission.

Why did most eventually lose? Why Dominant Parties Lose develops a theory of single-party dominance, its durability, and its breakdown into fully competitive democracy. Greene shows that dominant parties turn public resources into patronage goods to bias electoral competition in their favor and virtually win elections before election day without resorting to electoral fraud or bone-crushing repression. Opposition parties fail not because of limited voter demand or institutional constraints but because their resource disadvantages force them to form as niche parties with appeals that are out of step with the average voter. When the political economy of dominance— a large state and a politically quiescent public bureaucracy—erodes, the partisan playing field becomes fairer and opposition parties can expand into catchall competitors that threaten the dominant party at the polls. Greene uses this argument to show why Mexico transformed from a dominant party authoritarian regime under PRI rule to a fully competitive democracy. He also shows that this argument can account for single-party dominance in other countries where the surrounding regime is authoritarian (Malaysia and Taiwan) and where it is democratic (Japan and Italy). The findings have implications for Mexico’s political future, the formation of new political parties, transitions to democracy, and the study of competitive authoritarianism. Kenneth F. Greene is Assistant Professor of Government at the University of Texas at Austin. His research on regimes, political parties, and voting behavior has been published in the American Journal of Political Science, Comparative Political Studies, PS: Political Science and Politics, Política y Gobierno, Foreign Affairs en Español, and edited volumes. He has served as Co-Principal Investigator on two National Science Foundation grants for elite and voter survey research in Mexico, won a Fulbright-García Robles fellowship, and held visiting positions at the Center for Democracy and Civil Society at Georgetown University and the Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame.

Those who migrated set up complex social networks as well as hospitals and brotherhoods for mutual help. One of those, the Congregacion de San Fermin de los Navarros, linked those coming from Navarre, who held important positions in commerce, banking and royal bureaucracy through strong kinship and patronage networks. The building of a new church for the fraternity shows up the strong economic position of its members. Several internal debates point out how consistent the reciprocal relationship was between these brotherhoods and the close but separate neighborhoods fo the Navarrese and Basque communities in Madrid.","18th century; Madrid; Migrations; Navarre; Social networks",,,,,,,"Este trabajo se ha realizado en el marco de los proyectos BHA 2003-00778 «Migraciones y movilidad social en el valle del Ebro, siglos XVI-XVIII» y HUM 2004-00537 «Absolutismo y mercado.

Vaya para ambos mi mayor agradecimiento; En este artículo los términos nación, comunidades nacionales, de nacionales, que los contemporáneos sin excepción utilizaban para referirse a ellos mismos, no tiene el significado político actual de ciudadanos de un Estado, sino un significado social. La formaban quienes compartían vínculos territoriales de vecindad, naturalidad, lengua, parentesco, linaje o devoción, o incluso quienes simplemente se consideraban adscritos a un grupo social o de poder que así se denominara. Tenía un significado polivalente que más que para definir el grupo propio servía para diferenciarlo de los demás; Flynn, M., (1989) Sacred Charity.

Por un tiempo el rey no tuvo competencias, probablemente porque no eran de patronato real y el nombramiento de oficios no implicaba rentas, y por eso no hay noticia de ellas en los llamados libros de iglesia en que el rey y el Consejo de la Cámara de Castilla anotaban las resoluciones sobre los oficios eclesiásticos cuyo nombramiento correspondía al rey.

La lista de mujeres comprendía un cierto número de monjas que no podían figurar más que como tales: se consideraba que al adquirir tal condición «se casaban con Cristo».

La naturalidad era un privilegio jurídico político de alguien respecto a otros; sólo indirectamente definía su identidad en relación con los demás, que teniendo naturalidad distinta también podían ser súbditos del mismo rey. Ser natural era parecido a ser nacional o pertenecer a una nación en el sentido que entonces se daba al término, pero ambos no eran necesariamente equivalentes. En siglo XVIII empezaron a usarse con cierta ambivalencia, pero sólo tras la revolución burguesa la nacionalidad de un ciudadano acabó adscribiéndole a un Estado (nacional: así se le llamó en el siglo XIX) con los derechos y deberes que ello conllevaba; Nueva recopilación ..., lib.

It follows the occurrence of the phenomenon in relation to misuse of power for personal profit and provides an overview of theses formulated by political science authors on corruption and misuse of power (e.g. Rose-Ackerman, Warren, Johnston, Klitgaard) in relation to public administration and policy making. Examples and documentation of Slovak experience is provided, particularly in the field of politico-administrative relations and from the exercise of discretionary power of the street level bureaucracy. Corrupted behaviour usually arises in the environment of public power misuse, where institutional and legal framework does not provide sufficient opportunity for the expression of plurality of opinions which consequently is reflected in the unequal participatory access of various economic and political elites as well as interest groups.","Accountability; Administrative corruption; Clientelism; Corruption; Discretionary power; Interest groups; Patronage; Political corruption; State capture",,,,,,,"ARORA, D., Conceptualizing the Context and Contextualizing the Concept: Corruption Reconcidered (1993) Indian Journal of Public Administration, 39 (1), pp. 1-19. , s; BALL, A., MILLARD, F., (1986) Pressure Politics in Industrial Societies, , London, Macmillan; BALL, A. - PETERS, P.

It argues that state-society relations in Burma cannot be reduced to a series of zero-sum games. Although it is possible that the relations between the state and anti-state activists, such as students and monks, would take the form of zero-sum games, it is argued here that existing studies fail to explain the complexity of the state's relations with those segments of the Burmese population not actively opposed to the state, such as the business community. The paper explores the mutually empowering aspect of state-society relations in Burma by highlighting the benefits that both post-colonial Burmese government officials and various societal groups have gained from their patronage networks. It further shows that, although the parliamentary period was a more democratic one than the two subsequent military periods, the bedrock of state-society relations in Burma throughout the post-colonial period has been clientelism.","Clientelism; Institutional capacity; State capacity; State-society relations; Zero-sum game","clientelism; post-colonialism; state-business relations; state-local relations; Asia; Eurasia; Myanmar; Southeast Asia",,,,,,"Maung, M., (1991) The Burma Road to Poverty, , Praeger Publishers, New York;; Steinberg, D., Neither silver nor gold: The 40th anniversary of the Burmese economy (1989) Independent Burma at Forty Years: Six Assessments, , Josef Silverstein, ed, Southeast Asian Program, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY; Steinberg, D., (1990) The Future of Burma: Crisis and Choice in Myanmar, , University Press America, Lanham, Chapter 2; Fink, (2001) Living Silence: Burma Under Military Rule, , Zed Books, New York;; Lintner, B., (1989) Outrage, 4, p. 6. , White Lotus, Hong Kong, Chap 1; Maung, M., supra note 1 Chap, 4 (6), p. 8; Maung, M., (1993) Totalitarianism in Burma: Prospects for Economic Development, p. 2. , Paragon House, St. Paul, MN, Chap 1; Maung, M., (1998) The Burma Road to Capitalism, , Praeger, New York, Chap 2;; Silverstein, From a political and an administrative state supra, pp. 10-17. , note 1; Nainggyandaw, Sipwa swenwepwe [The State Seminar on the Economy] Government Printing House, pp. 131-135. , Rangoon, pp, Senior government officials often noted that due to budget constraints, the government could not reduce the tax imposed on private enterprises; Although nomination of candidates for township people's councils was done by township party units, members of the Party's Central Executive Committees, the People's Council of State, Regional Party Units and divisional/state people's councils also put forward their nominations informally.

Nothing would make Burmese people more proud than if the Burmese soccer team won a championship at a South East Asian sports event. Between the 1950s and early 1970s, the Burmese national soccer team was one of the best in Asia and many Burmese athletes won prizes at Asian sports events. However, since the late 1970s, the Burmese soccer team and Burmese athletes have not performed well at regional sports events. Songs composed and recorded to honour the triumph of Burmese sports in the 1950s, 60s and early 70s did not get a chance to be played on state television and radio.

They all said that they always discussed rumours about political developments in the country with friends and families. However, all the students expressed anxiety for the safety and welfare of their families and futures; they had no desire to involve themselves in politics because it was synonymous with trouble.

As each emergent value has gained political strength, its increased importance has been reflected in the forming of corresponding public personnel systems and their related techniques. Traditionally, conflict in the United States has centered around four fundamental values: political responsiveness, organizational efficiency and effectiveness, individual rights, and social equity. Political responsiveness is the belief that government answers to the will of the people expressed through elected officials, and the public workforce must, in turn, be made to answer to those in elective office. In a system grounded on this value, the political and personal faithfulness of public employees may best be ensured through an appointment process that considers political loyalty, along with education and experience, as indicators of merit. Often, in order to promote responsive government, elected officials are authorized to fill certain jobs through political appointments. Organizational efficiency and effectiveness reflect the desire on the part of elected officials and the public to maximize productivity. This suggests that employment decisions about whom to hire, reassign, or promote should be based on applicants' and employees' competencies, rather than on their political loyalty. The concept of individual rights suggests that citizens must be protected from unfair actions of government officials. In the context of civil service systems, public employees' rights to job security and due process are maintained through merit system rules and regulations that protect them from inappropriate partisan political pressure. In parallel fashion, public employees who are union members will have recourse to work rules contained in collective bargaining agreements that protect them from arbitrary management decisions. Social equity as a personnel value places emphasis on fairness to groups such as women, racial minorities, the disabled, and veterans, which may otherwise be disadvantaged by a market economy that accepts the legitimacy of discrimination in hiring and in pay. As is the case with individual rights as a principal value, social equity is concerned with fairness. But unlike individual rights, which are based on personal attributes like education, experience, or seniority, social equity is concerned with employment preferences based on membership in a protected class or group. Within the past quarter century, these four traditional values have been supplemented by increasingly powerful emergent ""antigovernment"" values. Early evidence of the rise of these values is found in the 1976 presidential campaign, won by Jimmy Carter, who ran against the national government as a Washington ""outsider."" Following the election, Carter proposed the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act on grounds that included poor performance in the public service and difficulty in controlling and directing bureaucrats. Beginning in 1980, the Reagan administration, though starting from fundamentally different values and policy objectives, continued to cast government as part of the problem, and to campaign against the infrastructure of public agencies and public administrators. The ascendant anti-government assumptions behind this shift were paralleled by a related general transition from political to economic perspectives on public policy. That transition emphasized the role of market forces on individuals and the economy, rather than program implementation by government agencies and employees, as the most efficacious tools of public policy (Beckett 2000). Economic perspectives and the value of administrative efficiency clearly placed intense political pressure on the public sector to ""do more with less."" The pressure to do more caused government to attempt to become more accountable through such techniques as program budgeting, management by objectives, program evaluation, and management information systems. The pressure to do more with less money caused governments to lower expenditures through tax and expenditure ceilings, deficit reduction, deferred expenditures, accelerated tax collection, service fees, user charges, and a range of legislative and judicial efforts to shift program responsibilities and costs away from each affected government. Since from 50 to 75 percent of public expenditures go toward employee salaries and benefits, efforts to increase accountability and reduce costs have necessarily focused to a large extent on the field of public personnel management. These underlying contemporary political and economic forces shaped three specific emerging anti-government values with implications for personnel policy: individual accountability, limited and decentralized government, and community responsibility for social services. First, proponents of individual accountability expect that people will make individual choices consistent with their own goals, and accept responsibility for the consequences of these choices, rather than passing responsibility for their actions onto the rest of society. Second, proponents of limited and decentralized government believe, fundamentally, that government is to be feared for its power to arbitrarily or capriciously deprive individuals of their rights. Advocates of this view also believe that it is easier to connect public policy, service delivery, and revenue generation in a smaller rather than larger unit of government. Decision makers are known, revenues are predictable, and services are directly visible in such circumstances, and for some, the reduction in size and scope of government is justified by the perceived ineffectiveness of government; by the high value accorded to individual freedom, responsibility and accountability; and by a reluctance to devote a greater share of personal income to taxes. Third, proponents of community responsibility for social services believe that local government agencies need to be supplemented by not-for-profit, nongovernmental organizations responsible for social services, recreation, and community development activities. For public personnel management, the most significant consequence of this value has been the creation of thousands of nonprofit organizations that routinely provide services funded by taxes, user fees, and charitable contributions. These forces-mistrust of government and increased reliance on market mechanisms-have significantly affected public management at state and local government levels as well as the federal level. In 1993 the National Commission on the State and Local Public Service, generally referred to as the Winter Commission after its chair William Winter, issued a report that was generally critical of traditional public personnel management practices. An essential tenet of that report was that while civil service systems had traditionally been designed to promote efficiency and employee rights by protecting the public service against political interference and patronage-based turnover, these systems had gradually evolved to a point where ""red tape"" had overly restricted management flexibility, and due process had unreasonably protected incompetent or insubordinate employees. Its fifth recommendation called for an ""end to civil service paralysis"" through the adoption of practices designed to make personnel management more responsive to executive leadership, more supportive of innovation and risk-taking, and more rewarding of performance (National Commission on the State and Local Public Service 1993, Thompson 1994). © 2006 State University of New York.

The introduction of formal politics in Saudi Arabia",2006,"Internationale Politik und Gesellschaft",,"3",,"65","78",,5,,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33747203296&partnerID=40&md5=d9567ebcbcca1841d2129be7c4232772",,"Hertog, S.","Saudi Arabia is often treated as an exceptional case by both political scientists and regional specialists. This is true in many regards, but both communities seem to overlook the fact that the nature of the kingdom as an »outlier« makes the testing and comparison of broader hypotheses of comparative politics all the more rewarding. This is especially the case with recent institutional changes in the political field, which partially fit patterns witnessed in many other authoritarian countries, but are at the same time situated in a specific Saudi context of skewed state-society relations and rentierism. Saudi Arabia has seen a modest but discernible measure of political »liberalization« since at least 2003. A number of new »interest groups« such as professional associations and a human rights organization have come into being, and elections have been held in various organizations and on the municipal level. The Kingdom seems to have departed from the old model of Saudi politics which was characterized by an omnipresent bureaucracy and a formally atomized society. The recent institutionalizations of politics in the Kingdom open up unprecedented spaces for public debate. At the same time, they signify an attempt to modernize Saudi political paternalism, a modernization, which is happening along »corporatist« lines: interest groups and interest articulation mechanisms are licensed and more or less controlled by the state. They have monopolies on specific, exclusive task areas and are therefore organized in accordance with functional criteria. This set-up is quite different from the Western (or Anglo-American) ideal-type of »pluralism« which stipulates a free interplay of competing and overlapping interest groups which exist independently of the state. A striking characteristic of the recent corporatist moves is that most of the new formal groups have been created above society, with very weak links to the broader groups they are supposed to represent. The explanation lies in the informal nature of politics in Saudi Arabia and the absence of an associational tradition in the patronage-based Saudi rentier system. The inclusion of business in formal policy-making is an analytically important exception to this: different from other groups, it is politically meaningful, as Saudi business has a tradition of formal organization and lobbying, and has been granted space to develop historically. None of this is true of the other, recently created »civil society« organizations. This is why business inclusion is a success in terms of formal interest intermediation, whereas the activities of other groups appear anemic and politically irrelevant. Saudi corporatism is similar to that in a number of other, smaller Gulf states, where recent interest group politics also have a somewhat artificial flavor. As traditional corporatist interest groups in republican Arab regimes have lost much of their traditional mobilizational function, there might be a broader trend of convergence in the Arab world.",,,,,,,,"Hertog, S., »The new corporatism in Saudi Arabia: Limits of formal politics« (2006) Constitutional Reforms and Political Participation in the Gulf, , For a detailed discussion of the Saudi corporatist record, cf, in G.

Analyzing the cases of three newly democratized nations in Eastern Europe-Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia-O'Dwyer argues that competition among political parties constrains patronage-led state expansion. O'Dwyer uses democratization as a starting point, examining its effects on other aspects of political development. Focusing on the link between electoral competition and state-building, he is able to draw parallels between the problems faced by these three nations and broader historical and contemporary problems of patronage politics-such as urban machines in nineteenth-century America and the Philippines after Marcos. This timely study provides political scientists and political reformers with insights into points in the democratization process where appropriate intervention can minimize runaway state-building and cultivate efficient bureaucracy within a robust and competitive democratic system. © 2006 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.

However, there are inherent defects beneath the facade of free and fair elections that result from the domination of the electoral arena by a single political party - the Cambodian People's Party (CPP). The intertwining of the CPP and the state initially offered the party a coercive mechanism that coopted and coerced voters and restricted opposition parties' activities in rural areas. Subsequently, as internal and external political legitimacy has increasingly been linked to democratic procedures, the CPP and Prime Minister Hun Sen have used their domination of the state machinery to cultivate patronage politics that not only links them to voters but also to government officials and business tycoons.

Today, it is indeed difficult to imagine astronomy education without these magnificent celestial theaters. But projection planetariums, first developed in Germany, have been a part of American museum pedagogy only since the early twentieth century and were not widespread until the 1960s. In this unique social history,former planetarium director and historian of science Jordan D. Marché II offers the first complete account of the community of individuals and institutions that, during the period between 1930 and 1970, made planetariums the popular teaching aids they are today. Marché addresses issues such as the role of gender and social developments within the planetarium community, institutional patronage, and the popularization of science. He reveals how, at different times, various groups, including financial donors, amateur scientists, and government officials, viewed the planetarium as an instrument through which they could shape public understanding and perceptions of astronomy and space science. Offering an insightful, wide-ranging look into the origins of an institution that has fascinated millions, Theaters of Timeand Space brings new perspectives to how one educational community changed the cultural complexion of science, helped shape public attitudes toward the U.S. space program, and even contributed to policy decisions regarding allocations for future space research. © 2005 by Jordan D.

This paper examines recent experiences in the fight against corruption in the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). It argues that the technocratic remedies supported by donors have underplayed the degree to which progress in tax administration depends upon a thorough 'cultural change' in the public service. The motives of individual actors are often inextricably tied to the interests of the social groups to which they belong. In the URA patronage runs through networks grounded on ties of kinship and community origin. As such, people recognize the benefits of large extended families and strong kinship ties, even as their social and economic aspirations may be indisputably modern. This implies that such social relations may undermine formal bureaucratic structures and positions. If these problems, which are rooted in social norms and patterns of behavior rather than administrative features, are overlooked, the result may be to distort incentives. As a consequence, the government's commitment to reforming the tax administration may also be undermined.","Corruption; Incentives; Social norms; Tax administration; Tax evasion; Uganda","bureaucracy; corruption; developing world; institutional reform; kinship; public service; tax incentive; tax reform; Africa; East Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Uganda",,,,,,"Barber, K., Popular Reactions to the Petro-Naira (1997) Readings in African Popular Culture, pp. 91-98. , K.

The Liquor Control Act was based on implicit and general concepts derived from the pre-prohibition concern over the morally suspect world of the saloon. Although the LCBO had been established as an objective bureaucracy, its officials, when inspecting hotels and enforcing the rules of the act, employed a language that demonstrated the persistence of the pre-prohibition value system of middle-class temperance reformers. Nevertheless, elements of the LCBO's activity illustrate clear attempts to move away from the pre-prohibition system of patronage towards something that resembled, at least structurally, the ideal, typical bureaucracy.",,,,,,,,"note; note; Campbell, R., (1991) Demon Rum or Easy Money?

During the first half of the 19th century almost all of these offices converted to professional bureaucracies with salaried employees. This paper explains the choice over purchase and patronage prior to 1800, and the later transition to professions, using the NIE hypothesis that the crown was interesting in maximizing the value of its offices, and therefore, its own treasury.

Chalcraft (1855-1943), a superintendent in the federal Indian boarding schools during the critical period of forced assimilation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Chalcraft was hired by the Office of Indian Affairs (now known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs) in 1883. During his nearly four decades of service, he worked at a number of Indian boarding schools and agencies, including the Chehalis Indian School in Oakville, Washington; Puyallup Indian School in Tacoma, Washington; Chemawa Indian School in Salem, Oregon; Wind River Indian School in Wind River, Wyoming; Jones Male Academy in Hartshorne, Oklahoma; and Siletz Indian Agency in Oregon. In this memoir Chalcraft discusses the Grant peace policy, the inspection system, allotment, the treatment of tuberculosis, corporal punishment, alcoholism, and patronage. Extensive coverage is also given to the Indian Shaker Church and the government's response to this perceived threat to assimilation. Assimilation's Agent illuminates the sometimes treacherous political maneuverings and difficult decisions faced by government officials at Indian boarding schools. It offers a rarely heard and today controversial ""top-down"" view of government policies to educate and assimilate Indians. Drawing on a large collection of unpublished letters and documents, Cary C. Collins's introduction and notes furnish important historical background and context. Assimilation's Agent illustrates the government's long-term program for dealing with Native peoples and the shortcomings of its approach during one of the most consequential eras in the long and often troubled history of American Indian and white relations. © 2004 University of Nebraska Press.

The Bloomsbury Groups' sense of experimentation and flexibility, their willingness to take action to create new institutions, and their distrust of bureaucracy, influenced Keynes's development of a new model for state patronage of the arts in 1946. He took an organization established during the Second World War to employ artists and organize morale‐boosting tours of the performing and visual arts, and oversaw its development into the Arts Council of Great Britain, the first such arts council. His model–making grants of public funds through semi‐autonomous government bodies to private individuals and privately operated arts institutions–became a standard form of public funding for the arts by the end of the twentieth century in many countries around the world. © 2004, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Arts Council of Great Britain; Bloomsbury Group; CEMA; John Maynard Keynes",,,,,,"Duke University","bell, (1914) Art, , Chatto & Windus, London; bell, ‘Art and politics I’ (1920) Athenaeum, p. 623. , 5 November; bell, ‘Art and politics II’ (1920) Athenaeum, (12 November), pp. 680-681; bell, (1928) Civilization, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL; bell, ‘Art and the planned state’ (1937) Forum, p. 37; bell, ‘A Ministry of Arts’ (1939) The Statesman and Nation, (14 October), pp. 518-519; bell, ‘Clive Bell: Maynard Keynes’ (1956) A Bloomsbury Group Reader, , in, ed.

Until the mid-1990s, the former were distinguished from the latter by certain interrelated structural characteristics. These characteristics were extended politicisation of the top administrative ranks; enduring patronage patterns in recruitment to the public sector; uneven distribution of human resources; formalism and legalism; and, with the exception of Spain, absence of a typical European administrative elite. The characteristics were related to the type of capitalism and political development in Southern Europe. South European bureaucracies have started evolving towards decentralisation and privatisation.

This paper adds another dimension to a profound understanding of this political reality by focusing on what is generally known in the national political lexicon as ""motions of support."" These are letters addressed to the President of the Republic by the elite of a specific ethnic group or region of the country whenever one of their members is promoted to an important position in the State bureaucracy, or state-owned enterprise that places the individual in a position to benefit himself and members of the group that he represents. The objectives of these letters are threefold: (1) to thank the President for compensating the region and its people; (2) to pledge the group's continuous and unflinching political support to the President; and (3) to remind the President that this pledge is a function of his ability to ensure a steady flow of ""development projects"" to their region. A content analysis of some of these motions of support would enable us to place them within the context of the politics of exclusion, and to emphasize that by giving vent to ethnoregional sentiments, Cameroon's body politic hinges on a system of patronage that is systematically melting away the unity of the country. © 2004 by Association of Third World Studies, Inc.",,"ethnopolitics; national politics; regional politics; Africa; Cameroon; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",,,,,,"Mbaku, J.M., Cameroon's stalled transition to democratic governance: Lessons for Africa's new democrats (2002) African and Asian Studies, 1 (3), pp. 135-136; Takougang, J., Krieger, M., (1998) African State and Society in the 1990s: Cameroon's Political Crossroads, p. 53. , Boulder, CO: Westview Press; Jua, N., Cameroon: Jump-starting an economic crisis Africa Insight, 21 (3), pp. 162-170; Awasom, N.F., (2001) Autochthony and Citizenship in Postcolonial Africa: A Critical Perspective on Cameroon, , African Studies Center, Leiden, Seminar paper; Konings, P., Nyamnjoh, F.B., Construction and deconstruction: Anglophones or autochthons?

By the end of 1742, eighty participants chosen from several offices within the palace bureaucracy based in Beijing completed the Golden Mirror of the Orthodox Lineage of Medicine, the only imperially commissioned medical text the Qing government's Imperial Printing Office published. The Golden Mirror represents both the limitations in the power of the Qianlong emperor and the dominance in the Manchu court of Chinese scholarship from the Jiangnan region during the first decade of his reign. Chinese scholars participating in the compilation of the Golden Mirror fashioned a medical orthodoxy for the empire in the mid-eighteenth century from regional trends in scholarship on history and the classics centered in the Jiangnan region since the sixteenth century. The Golden Mirror is an illuminating example of how medical scholars participated in the formation of evidential scholarship in early-modern China and why Manchu patronage, southern Chinese scholarship, and medical orthodoxy coalesced in the imperial court of the Qianlong emperor. © 2003 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",,"article; awards and prizes; book; China; history; national health service; public figure; publishing; Awards and Prizes; China; Encyclopedias; Famous Persons; Historiography; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; Publishing; State Medicine",,,,,,"Qian, W., (1990) Yizong jinjian, , 2 vols.

The man-darin status of the administrative elite prevails, despite a long-term decrease in the share of jurists and more open career patterns, both due to a first managerialist turn in the 1970s. It is argued that new administrative policies are carried out like any other substantive policy. On the polity dimension, the bureaucracy's function as the center of expertise is reflected in terms of both formal education and subjective role understanding. On the policy dimension, the 1970 reformist agenda of the Brandt government resulted in higher programmatic commitment than at the point of replication of the base line study in 1987, when the Kohl government was consolidating public finances. Under conditions such as those prevailing after national unification in 1990 and since about 1995, though, top administrators can turn quite managerial.

Administrative reform came in the wake of the constitutional reform that transformed unitary Belgium into a federal state with several governments, each with a civil service of its own. The fiscal crisis prompted them to look favorably on the promises of New Public Management (NPM). The new Flemish government was first to take advantage of this opportunity, as it had the financial resources, the tendency to refer to Anglo-Saxon and Dutch examples, and the right political and administrative leadership. The staying power of these as yet precarious reforms depends on the continuity of political leadership, the establishment of an administrative culture matching the institutional innovations, and resistance to the endemic temptation to use them for partisan purposes.",,,,,,,,"Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., (2000) In the Web of Politics: Three Decades of the U.S. Federal Executive, , Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution; Aberbach, J.D., Putnam, R.D., Rockman, B.A., (1981) Bureaucrats and Politicians in Western Democracies, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bouckaert, G., Auwers, T., (1999) De Modernisering van de Vlaamse Overheid [The Modernization of the Flemish Government], , Brugge: Die Keure; Brans, M., Hondeghem, A., The senior civil service in Belgium (1999) Bureaucratic Elites in Western European States.

Italian public administration is normally characterized as badly designed and inefficient, and government performance is usually classed as poor. I argue by contrast that bureaucratic inefficiency, excessive legislation and widespread bureaucratic corruption were features of Italian public administration that were deliberately designed by legislators and intended to enhance the re-election prospects for incumbents by providing them with opportunities for extensive constituency service. The underlying incentives stemmed from the candidates' search for the personal vote, essential for retaining public office. Differences in the laws regulating the financing of political campaigns explain why excessive bureaucratization in the Italian context also resulted in extensive political corruption.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,00071234,,,,"English","Br.

By considering the museum and monument (i.e., artifacts, historically significant geographic features, and the physical representation of historical experience) as among the most tangible aspects of historical capital, it is demonstrated how region, province, and nation are involved with public and private interests in an ongoing dialogue over what types of history are to be represented, and in what context. This evidence suggests that while the state may impose its own historical interpretation in key areas, most public history is sponsored and managed by provincial, regional, and even commercial interests which represent the immediate interest first, leaving the connection with the nation to develop on its own tenuous ground. Regional historical representation, therefore, demonstrated that ""national history"" is not the sum of its parts, and that the ""making"" of public history occurs at multiple levels of bureaucracy, and through many levels of patronage. © National Council for Public History.",,,,,,,,"Sickman, L., Provincial Museums of North China (1936) The Open Court, 1 (937), p. 65; Hung, W., (1989) The Wu Liang Shrine: The Ideology of Early Chinese Pictorial Art; Boas, F., communication to Berthold Laufer (1902) American Museum of Natural History; Yufa, Z., (1982) Zhongguo xiandai hua dichu yu yanjiu, Shandong sheng 1860-1916, p. 200. , Modernization in China, 1860-1916, Taibei: Academica Sinica; Sickman, Provincial Museums of North China, 73; Geil, W., (1911) Eighteen Capitals of China, p. 391. , London: Constable & Co; Wang, H., (1990) Zhongguo bowuguanxue jichu [The Basis of Chinese Museology] (Shanghai: Zhongguo Guji Chubanshe, p. 100; Zhang, (1911) Zhongguo xiandai hua dichu yu yanjiu, Shandong sheng 1860-1916, p. 200; Franck, H., (1923) Wandering in Northern China, p. 269. , New York: The Century Co; Geil, Eighteen Capitals of China, p. 392; Chi, L., (1956) Ch'eng-tzu-yai: The black pottery culture site at Lung-shan-chen in Lich'eng-hsien, Shantung; David Murphy, J., (1995) Plunder and Preservation, p. 183; Fang, K., (1997) Shan-Shaan Huiguan [Shanxi-Shaanxi Merchant Association] (Liaocheng, Shandong: Jinling Shushe, p. 50; Franck, Wandering in North China, p. 283; The Confucius family mansion had undergone complete renovation in 1935 for the wedding of the seventy-third descendant of Confucius.

Through an in-depth look at the Kenyan case, this paper examines some of the deep political dynamics of the current desperate situation. We demonstrate how in Kenya, state–university links involve attempts by higher-level government officials to control campuses through patronage, surveillance, and violence and how institutional configurations facilitate this. As the burden of repression falls on student activists who challenge current power configurations, we examine the current crisis through a student lens. By presenting and analyzing the historical narrative of student activism on campus, we show the inadequacy of overly structural, economic approaches to the crisis favored by the World Bank and some of its critics. Instead, we show the critical importance of understanding how the university crisis is organically linked to wider political processes, including local struggle over democratization of the state and economy. © 2002, African Studies Association.

All along the XIV century the cathedral and the three parishes of Sta. Maria del Mar, Sta. Maria del Pi and Sant Just in Barcelona had been rebuilt. Church authorities had expected that changuig the romanic churches into the the gothic style known today would be slow and expensive, that is why they decided to confer the new chapels to wealthy people who in turn were supposed to give the eclesiastical institution a generous donation. The promoters of these chapels were mostly merchants and royal civil servants who were at that time in the best social position. Most of them belonged to families who had achieved this position in the past, but we have concentrated in those who were the last ones to obtain better standards of social consideration. The monitoring of their social development has been done thoug legal documentation.","14th century; Barcelona; Cathedral; Chapels; Merchants; Parishes; Patronage; Royal civil servants",,,,,,,"Doctora en Història de l'Art, , per la Universitat de Barcelona; BORAU, C., (2002) Els promoters de capelies i retaules en la Barcelona del segle, 14, pp. 4-7. , Barcelona, (en prema; ADB, RD, IV, fols. 240r-250r; ADB, RD, VI, fols. 123v-128v; ADB, RD, VII, fols. 158r-159v; Llibre d'Institucions de Beneficis i Capellanies, fol, pp. 9v. , AHPSJ; ADB, RD, I, fol. 224v; ADB, RD, I, fols. 330v-333v; MADURELL I MARIMON, J.M., (1949) El pintor Lluís Borrassá: su vida, su tiempo, sus seguidores y sus obras, Anales y Boletín de los Museos de Arte de Barcelona, 7, p. 8. , 1950) i 10 (1952), Barcelona; Speculum, 2, pp. 100r. , ACB; AHPB, 23/3, s. f., 3-l-1375.Veg.

This rhetorical strategy foregrounded the officials' participation in an ideally symbiotic relationship with the emperor they served. The author analyses instances in which leading bureaucrats recontextualized official occasions associated with the emperor to produce commemorations that clearly were not meant to be seen as positioned solely in the official sphere. They situated these works in their own personal spheres in terms of patronage, ownership and authorship of texts prominently featuring their own aims. This was done to enhance their own social status, reaffirm the prestige of office-holding, and solidify their close relationship with the reigning emperor. © Association of Art Historians 2002.",,,,,,,,"Thorp, R., Vinograd, R., (2001) Chinese Art and Culture, p. 280. , New York; Jang, S., Representations of Exemplary Scholar-Officials, Past and Present (1999) Arts of the Sung and Yuan: Ritual, Ethnicity, and Style in Painting, pp. 56-67. , ed.

Who were they, how and why were they chosen? A recent deposit in Rhodes House Library, Oxford, offers a unique insight into the patronage system at work for first‐time appointments to the British Colonial Service between 1900 and 1914. This is a set of the Desk Diaries of the Secretary of State for the Colonies' patronage office staff. Because of their purely personal and unofficial nature, the presentation of their entries knows no constraint – and no political correctness! Typical of the age, they are often starkly class‐ridden and racist. This Note quotes numerous examples from these unique Desk Diaries and examines the selection by patronage process as it applied, not to the upper gubernatorial ranks but to those seeking an initial appointment to the rapidly expanding Colonial Service in the opening decade of the 20th century. © Oxford University Press 2002.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00138266,,,,"English","Engl.

Institutional theorists within political science contend that political parties trace their beginnings to elite who nurtured them within the civil service bureaucracy, whereas theorists in political science who rely on microlevel explanations consider that parties developed to solve problems of social choice and collective action. Historians, in contrast, indicate that newspaper patronage in Washington, DC, beginning with Jefferson, was critical for the emergence of federal political parties. This study systematically examines the empirical implications of that assumption and considers both the organizational and political processes that underlie establishment of newspapers in the Capital, contributing to the understanding that newspapers provided a model both for the civil service and for political parties.",,,,,,,,"Aldrich, J.H., (1995) Why Parties?

It focuses on party organization, and specifically, on informal and under-institutionalized organizational forms. The article's central claim is that under-institutionalized organizational structures may facilitate party adaptation in a context of environmental crisis. Thus, mass populist parties, which lack the bureaucratic constraints that tend to inhibit change in better institutionalized labor-based parties, may possess a distinctive advantage in the neoliberal period. Although these parties' deep roots in society provide them with relative electoral stability, other populist legacies, such as fluid internal structures, non-bureaucratic hierarchies, and centralized leaderships, yield a high degree of strategic flexibility. The article applies this argument to the case of the Argentine Justicialista Party (PJ), a mass populist party that adapted with striking success in the 1980s and 1990s. In the coalitional realm, the poorly institutionalized nature of the PJ's party-union linkage allowed reformers to easily dismantle traditional mechanisms of labor participation, which contributed to the PJ's rapid transformation from a labor-dominated party into a patronage-based party. In the programmatic realm, the PJ's non-bureaucratic hierarchy and under-institutionalized leadership bodies provided President Carlos Menem with substantial room for maneuver in carrying out a neoliberal strategy that, while at odds with Peronism's traditional program, was critical to the party's survival as a major political force.",,"bureaucracy; labor participation; leadership; liberalization; neoliberalism; party politics; political economy; Latin America",,,,,,"Ansell, C.K., Stephen Fish, M., The Art of Being Indispensable: Noncharismatic Personalism in Contemporary Political Parties (1999) Comparative Political Studies, 32, pp. 283-312. , 3 May; Appleton, A., The Formal Rules Versus Informal Rules of French Political Parties (1994) How Political Parties Work: Perspectives From Within, , Kay Lawson, ed, Westport, CT: Praeger; Arias, M.F., From Rebellion to Rupture: Peronist Party Politics in Neuquen, 1961-1973 (1998) Peronism and Argentina, , James P.

Meanwhile, Macau was characterised by an official non-interventionist policy, a fragmentation of educational provision, and a lack of formal citizenship education. From 1987 onwards, Macau has been undergoing decolonalisation and an impending change of sovereignty, which resulted in the first official document concerning citizenship education issued by the government in 1995. But citizenship education has been less developed in Macau because of the problems of state capacity, autonomy and initiative in delivering education. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Challenging accounts of the contemporary PJ as a weak, personalistic organisation, it argues that the party maintains a powerful base-level infrastructure with deep roots in working- and lower-class society. This organisation has been understated by scholars because, unlike prototypical working class party structures, it is informal and highly decentralised. The PJ organisation consists of a range of informal networks - based on unions, clubs, NGOs and activists' homes that are largely unconnected to the party bureaucracy. These organisations provided the government of Carlos Menem with a range of benefits in the 1990s, particularly in the realm of local problem-solving and patronage distribution. Yet they also constrained the Menem leadership, limiting its capacity to impose candidates and strategies on lower-level party branches.",,"national politics; organizational framework; party politics; Argentina",,,,,,"Luna, F., (1984) Perón Y Su Tiempo, p. 60. , (Buenos Aires); Cavarozzi, M., (1988) Peronismo Y Radicalismo: Transiciones Y Perspectivas, p. 4. , (Buenos Aires); Mackinnon, M., Sobre los orígenes del partido peronista: Notas introductorias (1995) Representaciones Inconclusas: Las Clases, Los Actores, Y Los Discursos De La Memoria, 1912-1946, , W.

It has intrigued historians the way that this sophisticated British tool has exercised influence and control over the Shfï ̈ulamä in Iran and Iraq. However, the British became directly involved in the distribution of the Bequest in 1903, on the eve of the Constitutional Revolution. In view of the ̈ulamäs growing involvement in Iranian politics, and gross corruption among the distributors, the British saw the Bequest as a means to enhance their influence over the ̈ulamä in Iran. The political usage of the Bequest was a subject of a prolonged debate within Bequest bureaucracy. Disagreements often stemmed from different priorities, determined by local considerations, of British authorities in Iraq, Iran and India. In 1912 the British took over the direct distribution of the Bequest, abandoning their expectations to use the Bequest as a 'powerful lever' in Iran, and shifting their focus to enhancing their prestige in Iraq itself and acquiring the goodwill of Shfïis in India. These policies were renewed with greater vigour after the British occupation of Najaf and Karbalä in 1917. Overall, these British attempts ended in dismal failure, showing that charity, however generous, cannot compensate for the need of religious leaders to maintain popular support by distancing themselves from foreign patronage and tutelage. Moreover, manipulation proved less powerful than broader historical processes such as the rising national and religious awakening against foreign powers. © 2000 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.",,,,,,,,"Oudh is the British name of the Indian kingdom of Awadh, and it will be used here since the British documents constitute the major source for this study; Mahmüd, M., Ta'rïkh-i Raväbiẗ-i Siyäsï-yi Irän Va Inglïs Dar Qarn-i Nuzdahum Mïlädï, , 7 vols, 6 (Tehran 1949-1950), pp. 1343-1344; Ismäil Räin, Huqüq-i bïgirän-i inglïs dar irän (Tehran; 1347/1968). p. 104; Nikki Keddie, 'British Policy and the Iranian Opposition, 1901-1907', Journal of Modem History, 39 (1967), pp. 273-274; Dennis MacEoin, 'Changes in Charismatic Authority in Qajar Shi'ism', in C.

As federal employment grew in the 1820s, its ranks came to be dominated by patronage workers. After the Civil War, bureaucrats slowly displaced patronage workers at the federal level. Now, federal employments are being privatized and the bureaucracy shrunk. I explain this evolution of federal employment with one simple model of politics in a changing environment. Politicians combine into political firms to promise benefits to subsets of voters in return for election. If elected, politicians provide the benefits as efficiently as possible. Thus, politicians choose the form and size of their political firms to maximize expected political profits. Environmental changes affect the choices. The breach of the Appalachians in the 1810s, defeat of the South in the Civil War and the simultaneous rise of big and transcontinental industry, and contemporary worldwide economic integration (globalization) are three environmental changes that changed the efficient organization of federal political firms.",,,,,,,,"Aldrich, J.H., (1955) Why Ponies?: The Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Atack, J., Passell, P., (1994) A New Economic View of American History, , New York: W.

Insurgents continue to enjoy access to weapons, and benefit from the growing reluctance of officials in strong states to intervene against them directly. Officials in strong states instead choose to exercise influence through recruiting private investors and private security companies as proxies. Rulers of very weak states use their relations with these proxies to pursue private political and commercial agendas to a greater degree than was usual during the Cold War. The result is a decrease in rulers' interests in maintaining internal administrative hierarchies, controlling territory and monopolizing the exercise of violence, all regarded as conventional features of states. This signals an unexpected strength of very weak state rulers to pursue goals and agendas without building bureaucracies of their own. Officials in strong states tacitly accept this deviation from expectations regarding state behavior in the interest of maintaining order and preserving regimes that pay lip service to standard norms of state behavior.",,"international relations; political conflict; state role; war",,,,,,,,,,,,,,13845748,,,,"English","Int.
