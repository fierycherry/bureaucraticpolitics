We analyze the hypothesis using a multiple regression analysis approach, and 198 Chinese private firms are selected as the samples. The results conclude that: (1) Corporate political strategy will significantly impact on firm performance; (2) Financial incentive strategy, information strategy, lobbying strategy and political support strategy will significantly impact on firm performance; (3) Top management orientation moderates the relationship between corporate political strategy and firm performance; (4) Social capital developed from government officials moderates the relationship between corporate political strategy and firm performance. We explore the implications of these results for future research and practicing managers.","","China","",""
