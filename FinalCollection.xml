Using data from a large-scale executive survey from central government ministries and agencies in 18 European countries, the article provides a comprehensive cross-national and cross-organizational analysis of the autonomy-politicization conundrum and the drivers of the politicization of senior-level appointments. We find that national patterns of politicization correspond fairly well to country families as defined by administrative traditions, with some traditions being more coherent than others. At the organizational level, we find no evidence of efforts by politicians to compensate for extended autonomy by politicizing senior-level appointments, yet we provide evidence of differential effects of both formal and informal organizational characteristics on patterns of politicization. Our analyses show that politicization of senior appointments is lower in organizations with agency status, higher organizational social capital, higher financial autonomy and more extensive use of management tools. The article thereby not only offers comprehensive evidence of cross-country differences in politicization; it also adds to the literature on sub-national variation, by fleshing out an organizational perspective to the study of politicized appointments in the European context.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cardoso, André Luis Rabelo</author><author>Marenco, André</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political appointments in municipal governments and bureaucratic performance: evaluating achievement</title><secondary-title>Revista de Administracao Publica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Revista de Administracao Publica</full-title></periodical><pages>360-380</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucratic performance</keyword><keyword>municipal bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>political appointment</keyword><keyword>state capacity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>PRAIA BOTAFOGO-190, SAIA 538 5 ANDAR, RIO DE JANEIRO RJ, 22250-900, BRAZIL</pub-location><publisher>Fundacao Getulio Vargas</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/0034-761220190020x</electronic-resource-num><notes>(Political appointments in municipal governments and bureaucratic performance: evaluating achievement - Cardoso, André Luis Rabelo; Marenco, André)

The intention is to demonstrate patterns of political appointments that reflect institutional performance. The data were provided by Munic/IBGE 2005/14 and IpoC- Mstituicoes Politicas Comparadas/UFRGS. Firstly, the study observed the degree of variability of the distribution of these positions in municipal structures, and the quality of the appointees' education. Then, an analysis of spatial, global, and local dependence was performed. In addition, the difference in performance among municipalities was statistically tested using the independent t-test. The test compared municipalities' performance concerning the number and education of appointees. The study used the Municipal GDP-Per-Capita, the Indice Firjan de Desenvolvimento Municipal (IFDM), and the Indice de Governanca Municipal (IGM) created by the Federal Board of Administration as proxies for performance. The results stress the complexity of local public management since some of the tests indicate the number and education of appointees as predictors of high performance while other studies do not find the same relationship.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boräng, Frida</author><author>Cornell, Agnes</author><author>Grimes, Marcia</author><author>Schuster, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cooking the books: Bureaucratic politicization and policy knowledge</title><secondary-title>GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS</full-title></periodical><pages>7-26</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA</pub-location><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gove.12283</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BORANG ET AL Bureaucratic Politicisation 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Argentina</label><abstract>Accurate knowledge about societal conditions and public policies is an important public good in any polity, yet governments across the world differ dramatically in the extent to which they collect and publish such knowledge. This article develops and tests the argument that this variation to some extent can be traced to the degree of bureaucratic politicization in a polity. A politicized bureaucracy offers politicians greater opportunities to demand from bureaucrats—and raises incentives for bureaucrats to supply—public policy knowledge that is strategically biased or suppressed in a manner that benefits incumbents reputationally. Due to electoral competition, we suggest that the link between bureaucratic politicization and politicized policy knowledge will be stronger in democracies than in autocracies. A case analysis of Argentina's statistical agency lends credence to the underlying causal mechanism. Time-series cross-sectional analyses confirm the broader validity of the expectations and show that the relationship is present only in democracies.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Braun, Caelesta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Driving Forces of Stability: Exploring the Nature of Long-Term Bureaucracy-Interest Group Interactions</title><secondary-title>ADMINISTRATION &amp; SOCIETY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ADMINISTRATION &amp; SOCIETY</full-title></periodical><pages>809-836</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>administrative behavior</keyword><keyword>bureaucratic politics</keyword><keyword>in</keyword><keyword>interest group influence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0095399712438377</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BRAUN Bureaucrats IGs Interactions 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Netherlands</label><abstract>This article explores the nature of long-term interactions between bureaucrats and interest groups by examining two behavioral logics associated with stability in public policy making. In addition to the implicit short-term strategic choices that usually feature in resource-exchange explanations of interest group access to policy makers, this article shows that bureaucracy-interest group interactions are likely to be dictated by routine behavior and anticipating future consequences as well. By drawing on survey and face-to-face interview data of Dutch senior civil servants and interest groups, the analyses reveal that a practice of regular consultations, the need for political support, and a perceived influential position together explain why bureaucrats maintain interactions with interest groups. The combination of these behavioral logics adds important explanatory leverage to existing resource-exchange explanations and shows that organizational processes as well as long-term strategic considerations should be taken into account to fully explain bureaucracy-interest group interactions. © 2012 SAGE Publications.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laurens, Sylvain</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LOBBYISTS AND BUREAUCRATS IN BRUSSELS: CAPITALISM'S BROKERS</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>236</pages><keywords><keyword>European Commission</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>lobbyists</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>London</pub-location><publisher>Routlegde</publisher><isbn>9781351972512</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4324/9781315267258</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LAURENS Lobbyists and Bureaucrats 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The book illustrates the complex relationship between the lobbyists and bureaucrats, often misunderstood by both media and academics.

Are there differences among presidential mandates regarding the number of these professionals and their party affiliation? This study seeks to answer these questions, by building a new database that gathers the number of party-affiliated public officials that were appointed to Cargos de Direção e Assessoramento Superior (DAS) (position of director and high level consultant). Descriptive analysis found that the proportion of party-affiliated among appointees increased during the Workers’ Party (PT) governments and higher among appointed professionals that were not civil servant. The power-sharing among parties-mainly between the party of the president and the others-varies significantly according to the government. The partisan control over appointees is milder in middle-level and stronger at top-level positions. However, a minority of appointees are party members, even among the top-level bureaucracy. Therefore, we suggest that the political networks go beyond the party affiliations. To understand these networks it is necessary to reassess the role of party politics in shaping the executive agenda and enable reinterpretation of how presidents build and manage the government coalition and the support to their agenda in the legislative arena.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, Andy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Politics and the European Commission: Actors, interdependence, legitimacy</title><secondary-title>Politics and the European Commission: Actors, Interdependence, Legitimacy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Politics and the European Commission: Actors, Interdependence, Legitimacy</full-title></periodical><pages>1-230</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><publisher>Routledge</publisher><isbn>9780203356883</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4324/9780203356883</electronic-resource-num><notes>Not available - Requested through Research Gate</notes><research-notes>Not available - Requested through Research Gate</research-notes><urls/><label>EU</label><abstract>The European Commission is an organization which has come to fascinate or repulse a range of national politicians, journalists and social scientists.

Checks and balances and greater responsiveness to the public have also been sought in the appointment processes for the senior management of these new bodies. This paper examines the merits of the new appointment processes, in particular sequential selection, through a case study of the leadership selection process for the Corruption Eradication Commission. It reviews the process stipulated by law and its implementation in 2003, 2007 and 2010. The study argues that, while the short-listing of candidates by the selection committee aims at unprecedented openness and meritocracy, the process used has been tedious and has given insufficient weight to candidates' track records. Despite criticism that the final selection was pre-determined, the paper concludes that the overall selection process has upheld the principle of checks and balances between the executive and the legislature and ensured diversity of political support.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fowler, Luke</author><author>Kettler, Jaclyn J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Are Republicans Bad for the Environment?</title><secondary-title>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>195-219</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>environmental policy</keyword><keyword>executive politics</keyword><keyword>federal and state politics</keyword><keyword>federalism</keyword><keyword>legislative and executive interaction</keyword><keyword>legislative politics</keyword><keyword>parties and interest groups</keyword><keyword>political parties</keyword><keyword>public policy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1532440020941794</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://FOWLER KETTLER Are Republicans Bad for Environment 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US;partisan control of offices</label><abstract>Does the partisanship of officeholders affect environmental outcomes? The popular perception is that Republicans are bad for the environment, but complicating factors like federalism may limit this outcome. Using a dataset that tracks toxic releases over 20 years, we examine how partisan control of executive and legislative branches at both state and federal levels affect environmental policy. Moving beyond the passage of policies or environmental program spending allows us to fully understand the impact of Republicans on the environment. In addition, we take into account structural complications that may shape the relationship between Republican control and environmental outcomes. We find that the conventional wisdom that Republicans are bad for the environment has some validity, but it is dependent on what offices Republican elected officials occupy. More specifically, Republicans significantly affect toxic chemical releases when occupying governorships and controlling Congress. Our conclusions provide further insight into understanding how partisanship affects environmental outcomes, including how partisanship composition across the federal system matters.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frye, Timothy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Capture or exchange?

This redefinition has been particularly difficult in Russia, where policy makers and scholars alike have cited an incestuous relationship between business and the state as a key impediment to an orderly market economy. However, we have few empirical studies of business lobbying in Russia. Views about lobbying are extensively coloured by writings about the oligarchs-a small group of powerful industrialists and financiers that is by definition atypical. In addition, analyses of lobbying tend to focus on sectors or regions rather than firms. Most important, discussions of business-state relations in the region tend to concentrate on successful lobbyists and ignore firms that are not influential. By examining only cases where firms influence policy, observers risk distorting perceptions of the extent and significance of lobbying. This article examines business lobbying in Russia using an original survey of 500 firms conducted between October and December 2000 in eight cities and presents three findings. First, the sources of lobbying power vary by level of government and by type of firm. While large firms claim to be able to influence legislation at all levels of government, the impact of property type-whether a firm is state-owned, privatised or de novo private-varies by level of government. Property type matters little for lobbying the federal or municipal governments, but at the regional level state-owned firms are more successful and de novo private firms are less successful lobbyists than privatised firms. This suggests that efforts to tailor policies to level the economic playing field in Russia should focus on the regional level of government. Second, successful lobbyists use a variety of means to influence legislation. As expected, personal consultations with state agents are a valuable tool for firms. More surprising, half of the successful lobbyists in the sample relied on a business organisation to obtain favourable legislation for their firm, suggesting that business lobbying in Russia may be somewhat more institutionalised than is commonly recognised. Third, relations between influential firms and the state are better characterised by elite exchange than by pure capture. Successful lobbyists are more likely to get direct benefits, such as subsidies or tax breaks, from the state. However, they are also more likely to be subject to price controls and are inspected more frequently than other firms in the sample. As price controls and inspections provide benefits for politicians and bureaucrats, state officials also gain from granting individual firms influence over legislation and other normative acts. These results also indicate that business-state relations in Russia are less one-sided in favour of business than is commonly argued.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rommetvedt, Hilmar</author><author>Thesen, Gunnar</author><author>Christiansen, Peter Munk</author><author>Norgaard, Asbjorn Sonne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coping With Corporatism in Decline and the Revival of Parliament: Interest Group Lobbyism in Denmark and Norway, 1980-2005</title><secondary-title>COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES</full-title></periodical><pages>457-485</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Denmark</keyword><keyword>Norway</keyword><keyword>corporatism</keyword><keyword>governments</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>lobbyism</keyword><keyword>parliaments</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA</pub-location><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0010414012453712</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ROMMETVEDT ET AL Interest Group Lobbyism in Denmark and Norway, 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Denmark;Norway</label><abstract>Denmark and Norway have experienced significant political changes during the past three decades, changes that affect the constraints and opportunities organized interests are facing. Corporatist representation in the policy-making process has declined, and changes in executive-legislative relations have increased the power of parliaments. Organized interests are expected to adapt to these changing circumstances to maintain their political influence. This article shows how Danish and Norwegian interest groups have coped with the decline of corporatism and the revival of parliaments. Representation in corporatist policy-making committees and lobbying toward civil servants in government ministries have been supplemented and in some cases substituted by political lobbyism directed toward elected representatives in the parliament and the government. The analysis is based on panel data from several surveys carried out among nationwide interest groups in Denmark and Norway.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huseyn, Afag</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Ibrahimov, M</author><author>Aleksic, A</author><author>Dukic, D</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF THE PARTICIPATION OF CIVIL SERVANTS IN DECISION-MAKING AFFECTING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES</title><secondary-title>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (ESD 2019): 37TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - SOCIO ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (ESD 2019): 37TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - SOCIO ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>57-66</pages><keywords><keyword>business activities</keyword><keyword>civil servants</keyword><keyword>decision-making</keyword><keyword>economic development</keyword><keyword>effective management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA</pub-location><publisher>VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT \&amp; ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY</publisher><notes>37th International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social

The article theoretically analyzes the necessity of making changes in decision-making process on regulating entrepreneurship during the reforms in the state governance model. Directions of relationships between civil servants and entrepreneurs, mechanisms of conflict of interests have been clarified. Various approaches to the degree of involvement of entrepreneurs, civil servants and political leaders in decision making affecting entrepreneurial activity, the stages of sequencing the decision-making process, and the opportunities and freedoms granted to civil servants in the decision-making process has been analyzed. The role of human factor in decision-making process, the requirements of the administrative management apparatus, the existing problems in assessing the implementation of decisions has been explained, the systematic approach and the difficulties encountered in the use of situational analysis methods have been indicated. The complexity of grouping existing attitudes and relationships in various structures of the administrative management system, the effects of decisions and goals of the sub-divisions in public bodies on the decision and purpose of the overall state, and the shortcomings that arise during the execution have been identified. In the research process, attention was paid to the experience of different developed countries, comparative analysis, logical summarization and grouping, synthesis methods have been used. Recommendations on improving effectiveness in public administration were put forward, practical proposals were made regarding the preparation, acceptance, implementation and monitoring of enforcement of decisions within the competence of state bodies belonging to the civil service system.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lochbihler, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Brussels reputation story - The interplay of public affairs and reputation</title><secondary-title>Reputation Capital: Building and Maintaining Trust in the 21st Century</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Reputation Capital: Building and Maintaining Trust in the 21st Century</full-title></periodical><pages>101-111</pages><keywords><keyword>civil servant</keyword><keyword>corporate social responsibility activity</keyword><keyword>good reputation</keyword><keyword>public affair</keyword><keyword>select committee</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher><isbn>9783642016295</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-642-01630-1_8</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1

At the European level especially, it is clear that the EU is paying attention to its reputation among citizens. Reputation has an influence on the share price of companies just as it determines a politician∈s success or defeat. But what is the significance of reputation at the intersection of business and politics - where, in the context of public affairs, there is direct dialogue between the representatives of various interests on the one hand and politicians or civil servants on the other? What are the characteristics of a good reputation that matter in context of political lobbying? How should an organisation present itself to EU institutions in Brussels in order to earn their trust?</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cohen, Nissim</author><author>Horev, Tuvia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Policy entrepreneurship and policy networks in healthcare systems - the case of Israel's pediatric dentistry reform</title><secondary-title>ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>pediatric dentistry reform</keyword><keyword>policy change</keyword><keyword>policy entrepreneurs</keyword><keyword>policy networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>BIOMED CENTRAL LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13584-017-0146-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://COEN VANNONI Sliding doors in Brussels 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Israel</label><abstract>Background: Can the entry of a policy entrepreneur challenge the equilibrium of a policy network and promote changes that might clash with the goals of powerful civil-servants and/or interest groups and, if so, why and how? Our goal is to examine two sides of the same coin: how does an in-depth analysis of Israel's dental care reform enrich our understanding of policy networks and policy entrepreneurship? Second, how does the literature on policy networks and policy entrepreneurship help us understand this reform? Based on a theoretical framework that appears in the literature of policy entrepreneurship and policy networks, we analyze the motivations, goals and strategies of the main actors involved in the process of reforming pediatric dental care in Israel. We demonstrate how a policy entrepreneur navigated within a policy network and managed to promote a reform that, until his appearance, no one else in that network had succeeded in enacting. Methods: Our goals are advanced through a case study of a reform in pediatric dentistry implemented in Israel in 2010. It rests on textual analyses of the literature, reports, committee minutes, parliamentary proceedings, print and online media, and updates in relevant legislation and case law between 2009 and 2015. In addition, the case study draws on the insights of one of the authors (TH), who played a role in the reform process. Results: Historical circumstances and the Israeli public's longstanding lack of interest in changing the existing model as well as interest groups that preferred the dominance of the private sector in the dental healthcare system kept that area out of the services supplied, universally, under the National Health Insurance Law. This situation changed significantly following the publication in 2007 of a policy analysis that contributed to shifts in the motivations and balance of power within the policy network, which in turn prepared the ground for a policy change. In this environment a determined policy entrepreneur, who identified a window of opportunity, took the lead and instituted an innovative and far-reaching reform. Conclusions: A policy entrepreneur can leverage external factors as well as the previous activities of a policy network that has already matured to create a policy change. Such entrepreneurial activity includes maneuvering around opponents and overcoming resistance from various stakeholders.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vesa, Juho</author><author>Kantola, Anu</author><author>Binderkrantz, Anne Skorkjaer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Stronghold of Routine Corporatism?

Studies of Denmark, Norway and Sweden demonstrate that interest groups are less frequently involved in committees preparing policy, that lobbying of parliament has become more important and that the position of citizen groups has strengthened. However, systematic studies of present-day Finland are largely missing. This article therefore adds to the literature by focusing on the Finnish case. Drawing on surveys of interest groups and civil servants, the involvement of interest groups in policy making in Finland is assessed and compared with Denmark and the United Kingdom. It is found that: (1) working groups and similar bodies are still very important sites of advocacy; (2) public administration is a more important site of advocacy than parliament or government; (3) economic groups continue to enjoy a particularly privileged position; and (4) resources predict groups' access to policy making more strongly in Finland than in Denmark or the United Kingdom. These findings imply that routine corporatism persists in Finland to a greater extent than in Denmark. The study augments the existing evidence that corporatism may have adapted to new circumstances rather than being eliminated.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Montpetit, Eric</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Between Detachment and Responsiveness: Civil Servants in Europe and North America</title><secondary-title>WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>1250-1271</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \&amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01402382.2011.616663</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MONTPETIT Civil Servants in Europe and North America 2011.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Europe;North America</label><abstract>The article shows that civil servants who believe that the long-term interest of society is best served by their detached policy advice to policy-makers also hold on to their opinion more than any other actor involved in policy development. However, more civil servants currently emphasise responsiveness, at the expense of detached analysis, owing to increased exposure to international consultancy and forums. As a consequence, the attitude of civil servants in developing public policy is more likely to be indistinguishable from that of actors who have political functions, without significant variation from country to country. Evidence supporting this argument is provided by an analysis of the results of a survey first conducted in 2006 and repeated in 2008. The two waves of the survey drew responses from civil servants, interest group representatives and non-governmental experts who contribute to biotechnology policy development in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and the European Union.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Savi, Riin</author><author>Randma-Liiv, Tiina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decision-making in time of crisis: cutback management in Estonia</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>479-497</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>3, SI</issue><keywords><keyword>Estonia</keyword><keyword>central government</keyword><keyword>cutbacks</keyword><keyword>decision-making</keyword><keyword>retrenchment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0020852315573131</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SAVI RANDMA-LIIV Decision-making in time of crisis 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Estonia</label><abstract>The article investigates the Estonian government's response to the fiscal crisis by looking at the dynamics of the decision-making processes during cutback management from 2008 to 2013 from the dichotomy of centralization-decentralization. The study explores the cutback decision-making by pinpointing the main actors and contextual variables shedding light on the management of fiscal crisis. It is demonstrated that, in general, the fiscal crisis contributed to increasing levels of centralization in governmental decision-making. The crisis decision-making was dominated by centralized political decisions and non-inclusion of the opposition and interest groups. Still, achieving urgent solutions was facilitated by decentralized decisions at the ministerial level, the empowerment of budgetary institutions and the intensive engagement of the civil servants. It has been indicated that the initially short-term procedures to enable cuts and resultant changes in decision-making processes are mostly in effect still in 2014 and thereby influence public administration practices in the long run. Points for practitioners The study shows that cutback management may lead to urgency in governmental decision-making, where centralization facilitates quick decisions. It is also demonstrated that a minority government is able to achieve fiscal adjustment even in a context of high political conflict. The crisis context sets new requirements to the competencies of public servants, as cutback management obliges them to cope with new and very complicated tasks. The article indicates that short-term cuts and changes in decision-making processes intended to alleviate the acute phase of crisis may remain in effect considerably longer than initially planned and thereby influence public administration practices in the long run.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Braun, Caelesta</author><author>den Berg, Caspar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>AT A SNAIL'S PACE: ON THE LIMITED EUROPEANIZATION OF DOMESTIC CONSULTATION PRACTICES</title><secondary-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</full-title></periodical><pages>763-781</pages><volume>91</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA</pub-location><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1467-9299.2012.02099.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BRAUN DE BERG IGs Civil Servants Europe 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Netherlands;UK</label><abstract>Consultation of major interest groups is a widespread administrative practice in many EU member states. To date it is unclear, however, how advancing European integration influences domestic consultation practices. This article examines the impact of European integration on domestic consultation practices by conceptualizing how the underlying rationales of government-interest group interactions and the level of involvement of interest groups are affected by European integration. The study draws on original survey data on senior civil servants in Britain and the Netherlands to empirically examine these effects. European integration is related in a limited way to domestic consultation practices, both in Britain and the Netherlands. This small but significant effect is mostly observed during the process of domestic preference formulation in EU-level policy making. Our findings suggest that intra-organizational processes, for example organizational routines and task-specialization, potentially play a greater role than has thus far been appreciated in Europeanization studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cloteau, Armele</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The `Angels of Europe': Corporate Public Affairs Employees as the In-House Entrepreneurs of Europe</title><secondary-title>SOCIOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>837-857</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>European Union</keyword><keyword>corporate influence</keyword><keyword>interest representation</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>policy-making</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>JILSKA 1, PRAGUE 1 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC</pub-location><publisher>SOCIOLOGICKY CASOPIS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.13060/00380288.2018.54.6.432</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CLOTEAU Lobbyists Civil Servants Europe 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>This article examines the inner workings of a private company's participation in the European policy game. The qualitative analysis shows that the promotion of a company's interests and its positioning at the level of the European Union is not self-evident and results from internal battles in which European public affairs employees play a pivotal role. Under what conditions do the European public affairs employees of a leading multinational firm endorse, manage, and promote an active position in the Brussels' polity sphere? This article highlights the process by which these `professionals of Europe' adapt to the specific requirements of the EU and mobilise an informal network to contribute to European policy-making. These lobbyists appear as `double entrepreneurs': as entrepreneurs on behalf of both their employers' interests and the European cause as they place themselves as the auxiliaries of EU civil servants. Maintaining a delicate balance, interest representatives occupy a position of dependence, both on their employer and on the polity field in which they valorise their `European institutional capital'. This position allows these social agents to serve as a broker between their employer and the European arena. In doing so, they nurture the porosity between (economic) interests and the public sector, which cuts across the field of `Eurocracy'.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Braun, Caelesta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Captive or the Broker?

This article analyzes the nature of this responsiveness by examining the brokerage potential of public agencies among interest groups. Such a brokerage potential is hypothesized to follow from agencies' preferences for policy goods as well as the tendency of interest groups to seek access to public agencies. It combines analyses of agencies' demand for policy goods with interest groups preferences for seeking access to specific policy venues. The analyses are based on survey data of national civil servants and interest groups in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands. The findings suggest that both strategic preferences as well as organizational routines positively correlate with a brokerage potential while interaction patterns within and with the organizational environment of public agencies can constrain their brokerage potential in several distinct ways.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buffardi, Anne L.</author><author>Pekkanen, Robert J.</author><author>Smith, Steven Rathgeb</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Shopping or Specialization?

Moreover, this literature focuses on interest groups and advocacy coalitions whose principal mandate is to influence public policy. Using original data, we test theories of venue selection among nonprofit organizations that report engaging in policy processes but the majority of which do not self-identify as an advocacy group. Our analyses explore the &quot;where&quot; of nonprofit advocacy across three different venue types: branch (executive, legislative), domain (bureaucracy, elected officials), and level of government (local, state, federal). Like interest groups, we find that nonprofits shop among both executive and legislative branches and among elected and bureaucratic domains; however, they tend to specialize in one level of government. Geographic scope and revenue source predicted venue targeting, but most other organizational characteristics including age, capacity, and structure did not.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Binderkrantz, Anne S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Different groups, different strategies: How interest groups pursue their political ambitions</title><secondary-title>Scandinavian Political Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scandinavian Political Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>173-200</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1467-9477.2008.00201.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BINDERKRANTZ IG Different Groups Different Strategies 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Denmark</label><abstract>The article compares the political activities of different types of interest groups. Drawing on data from a survey of all Danish national interest groups, it demonstrates significant variation in the strategic choices of different types of groups. Groups with corporative resources direct much attention towards influencing the bureaucracy. They possess resources valued by officials and therefore have good options for utilizing a strategy targeting the administration and seeking corporatist integration. By contrast, public interest groups are more likely to use publicly visible strategies in which affecting the media agenda plays a central role. By engaging in such strategies, public interest groups can demonstrate a high level of engagement to their diffuse membership. Furthermore, the goals of public interest groups are typically conducive to pursuit through public strategies. A third category of other groups is incorporated in the analyses as a point of reference to establish patterns of strategy use. While there are clear differences between groups with regard to most strategies of influence, different types of groups are equally engaged in a parliamentary strategy. Interacting with Parliament seems to be important for groups integrated in corporatist structures as well as for those relying more on public strategies. © 2008 Nordic Political Science Association.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cooper, Christopher A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Politicization of the Bureaucracy across and within Administrative Traditions</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Public Administration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Public Administration</full-title></periodical><pages>564-577</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>administrative tradition</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>comparative public administration</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>politicization</keyword><keyword>quality of government'</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01900692.2020.1739074</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://[Artigo] COOPER Politicization of Bureaucracy Across Traditions.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>comparative studies</label><abstract>It is frequently claimed within the politicization literature that while governments around the world are increasingly politicizing senior public service appointments, the nature and extent of this politicization varies across administrative traditions. To date, however, differences across administrative traditions have received little empirical scrutiny; research tends to be more comparable than comparative. Using data from an expert survey systematically measuring the merit-, political-, and personal-recruitment of senior public servants in 20 countries, this article examines differences across and within the Nordic, Westminster, Germanic and Napoleonic administrative traditions, in addition to the alternative Anglo-American and Southern European traditions. Various tests show meaningful variation in politicization across administrative traditions, with the starkest differences found between the Nordic and Napoleonic traditions. The results also show less variation among the countries comprising the Nordic tradition than that found within the other traditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lewis, David E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presidential appointments and personnel</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Political Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Political Science</full-title></periodical><pages>47-66</pages><volume>14</volume><keywords><keyword>burocracia</keyword><keyword>desempenho</keyword><keyword>presidente</keyword><keyword>serviço público</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-polisci-042009-121225</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Presidential appointments and personnel - Lewis, David E.)

I focus specifically on research analyzing changes in the institutional environment of presidential personnel, how presidents make decisions about whom to appoint, and the effects of presidential appointees on outputs. I explore what we know about how presidents have worked to change institutions surrounding presidential personnel by increasing the number of appointees and augmenting White House personnel operations. I examine how presidents decide what factors to value when choosing personnel. When do presidents value loyalty, competence, campaign support, or other characteristics of potential appointees? Finally, I examine the effects of appointees on outputs. What influence do appointees have over outputs and why do some have more influence than others? I describe the general trajectory of research in each area as well as some emerging issues confronting scholars in these areas. © Copyright 2011 by Annual Reviews.

Yet they have overlooked how the type of public administration—and the type of administrators—is associated with innovative attitudes. Using two large, unique comparative data sets on public bureaucracies and public managers, this article examines how bureaucratic politicization and legalistic features are associated with senior public managers’ attitudes toward innovation in 19 European countries. Results of multilevel analysis indicate that the bureaucratic politicization of an administration and the law background of public managers matter. Public managers working in politicized administrations and those whose education includes a law degree exhibit lower pro-innovation attitudes (i.e., receptiveness to new ideas and creative solutions and change orientation).</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dahlstrom, Carl</author><author>Holmgren, Mikael</author><author>Dahlström, Carl</author><author>Holmgren, Mikael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Political Dynamics of Bureaucratic Turnover</title><secondary-title>British Journal of Political Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British Journal of Political Science</full-title></periodical><pages>823-836</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>parliamentary democracy</keyword><keyword>policy conflict</keyword><keyword>political appointments</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA</pub-location><publisher>CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0007123417000230</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (The Political Dynamics of Bureaucratic Turnover - Dahlström, Carl; Holmgren, Mikael)

It argues that changes in a government's policy objectives can shift both political screening strategies and bureaucratic selection strategies, which produces turnover of agency personnel. To buttress this conjecture, it analyzes a unique dataset tracing the careers of all agency heads in the Swedish executive bureaucracy between 1960 and 2014. It shows that, despite serving on fixed terms and with constitutionally protected decision-making powers, Swedish agency heads are considerably more likely to leave their posts following partisan shifts in government. The note concludes that, even in institutional systems seemingly designed to insulate bureaucratic expertise from political control, partisan politics can shape the composition of agency personnel.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alfirdaus, Laila</author><author>Manalu, S Rouli</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The politics of local government environments evaluations Assessing bureaucracy in post-Reformasi Indonesia</title><secondary-title>PACIFIC JOURNALISM REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PACIFIC JOURNALISM REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>72-87</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Indonesia</keyword><keyword>Reformasi</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>case studies</keyword><keyword>environment</keyword><keyword>environmental  evaluations</keyword><keyword>environmental communication</keyword><keyword>local  government</keyword><keyword>natural  resources</keyword><keyword>public policy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>55 WELLESLEY ST E, AUCKLAND, 1020, NEW ZEALAND</pub-location><publisher>AUCKLAND UNIV TECHNOLOGY, CREATIVE INDUSTRIES RESEARCH INST</publisher><notes>From Duplicate 1 (The politics of local government environments evaluations Assessing bureaucracy in post-Reformasi Indonesia - Alfirdaus, Laila; Manalu, S Rouli)

Using the case of environmental evaluation in local government, where natural resources comprise most of the local economy, this article discusses the politics of bureaucracy in undergoing daily governing processes. The environment and natural resource businesses are two opposing fields. Environmental evaluation becomes a contentious area and is usually highly political. This article identifies the bureaucracy's politicisation in environmental evaluation as occuring in at least in two forms-in measurement and in project implementation. In terms of measurement, bureaucracy tends to use minimum standards, while in project implementation, there are some occasions where bureaucracy tends to sub-contract the work to the third party, usually NGOs, especially in relations to sensitive issues, so that it is politically safer for them, once the result is not as pleasing as expected. This article uses some cases in Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, Central Java, and Bangka Belitung, and applied case study as research approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Palus, Christine Kelleher</author><author>Yackee, Susan Webb</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oversight as Constraint or Catalyst?

For years, scholars have asserted the important informational role that bureaucrats play within the U.S. policy-making process. However, we have only limited knowledge of the theoretical mechanisms that may allow for this influence, or ultimately, whether this influence matters to public policy outcomes. We theorize that the political oversight of the bureaucracy by elected officials not only constrains the bureaucracy but also provides a pathway for agency officials to advance their preferences by communicating their policy expertise. We assess this argument with survey data from almost 600 state agency heads, drawn from the 50 states and across all agency types. Using a multilevel model, we find that the ``oversight mechanism'' is a key driver of agency influence over gubernatorial policy decisions; however, it does a poor job explaining agency policy influence within state legislatures. These results suggest that oversight allows agency leaders greater success in lobbying governors than more diffuse and diverse state legislatures.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reenock, Christopher M/</author><author>Gerber, Brian J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political insulation, information exchange, and interest group access to the bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</full-title></periodical><pages>415-440</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>OXFORD UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jopart/mum021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://REENOCK GERBER Political Insulation Interest Group Access 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Under political uncertainty, legislative coalitions have incentives to insulate policy from future coalitions. While there is evidence of legislators' use of agency design to insulate the bureaucracy from elected officials, little is known about the ultimate consequences of such design choices on the policy participation of interest groups. How such design choices affect group access is important because of the centrality of groups in providing both bureaucratic accountability and information for policy development. Accordingly, we examine the consequences of the so-called &quot;insulation game&quot; on group access to the bureaucracy. We develop an information exchange theory that portrays the impact of agency design choices on group-reported access as a function of the level of design-induced political insulation and the quality of the information offered by a given group. We test our theory with two original datasets that include design parameters of US state environmental agencies and survey data measuring reported agency access by state-level interest groups. Our results suggest that insulating agencies via design does lead to lower reported access to regulators by interest groups, but only among those groups who supply less valuable information.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rybar, Marek</author><author>Podmanik, Milan</author><author>Rybář, Marek</author><author>Podmaník, Milan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Politics of Appointment of Top Civil Servants: Career Backgrounds and Civil Service Politicization in the Czech Republic</title><secondary-title>NISPACEE JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NISPACEE JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY</full-title></periodical><pages>75-92</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Czech Republic</keyword><keyword>careers</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>executives</keyword><keyword>politicization</keyword><keyword>top civil servants</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND</pub-location><publisher>SCIENDO</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2478/nispa-2020-0015</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://RYBAR PODMANIK Appointments Czeck Republic 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Czech Republic;how to measure politicisation</label><abstract>This contribution seeks to answer the question whether the new civil service legislation that entered into force in 2015 in the Czech Republic led to the depoliticization of the country's ministerial bureaucracy. To that end, we compare the career backgrounds of top civil servants before and after the entry into force of the new Civil Service Act. The article examines the career backgrounds of the persons appointed as ministerial deputies between 2013 and 2018, focusing on their last ``pre-deputy{''} jobs and considering a broader set of their career attributes. A focus on the previous job reveals that even before the law was introduced, bureaucrats constituted the largest share of appointees, and their share even increased with the new legislation. The incidence of deputies appointed directly from party-related jobs dropped considerably. However, when a broader set of career attributes is considered, the share of partisans among the pre-2015 deputies nearly matches that of the career bureaucrats. Ostensibly political careers among the post-2015 deputies declined but remain significant. Hence, there has been a decline in the open politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy after 2015. Party political effects also matter, as the new ANO party, after entering the executive, has taken a different approach to top bureaucratic appointments than the other major governing Czech parties. Typically, deputies appointed into the positions under the ANO's control would not have links to the party itself but would be recruited via non-party channels, e.g. from pre-political networks of the ANO ministers and leaders. Consequently, though less politicized by party agents, the current Czech system is more a product of choices made by government ministers of the day than a stable arrangement resulting from firmly established norms and rules.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Monteiro, Lorena Madruga</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Public administration reform and State careers: The case of experts in public policies and government management in the federal Executive Power [Reforma da administração pública e carreiras de Estado: O caso dos especialistas em políticas públicas e gestã</title><secondary-title>Revista de Administracao Publica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Revista de Administracao Publica</full-title></periodical><pages>1117-1143</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>career</keyword><keyword>government management</keyword><keyword>public administration</keyword><keyword>public policy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/S0034-76122013000500003</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 6</notes><research-notes>cited By 6</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MONTEIRO Reforma da administração pública e carreiras de Estado 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84889683940&amp;doi=10.1590%2FS0034-76122013000500003&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5e1e64f4147245996880ab8b8d527f12</url></web-urls></urls><label>Brazil;how to measure professionalization</label><abstract>Aiming to analyze the way how recruitment based on the idea of &quot;technical competence&quot;, was incorporated in the Brazilian public administration after the 1995 administrative reform, this paper investigates the career of expert in public policies and government management. Among all public administration careers, that of expert in public policies and government management (EPPGM) is an exemplary case, since its creation brings the idea of constituting a stable bureaucracy in face of discontinuities in government, able to prepare and manage public policies in a continued flow, something which justifies studying it. Through various sources related to the career evolution, the profile, and training of these managers, and their distribution in the federal Executive Power, we demonstrate that the very training of these public officials ended up undergoing government interferences according to government guidance and that allocating these EPPGMs to jobs of Superior Management and Advisement (SMA) of the federal Executive has reconciled meritocratic principles with a certain relaxation of appointments, restricting, in theory, the spaces for political patronage.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boucher, Maxime</author><author>Cooper, Christopher A Cristopher A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Consultant Lobbyists and Public Officials: Selling Policy Expertise or Personal Connections in Canada?</title><secondary-title>Political Studies Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Political Studies Review</full-title></periodical><pages>340-359</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Westminster</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>consultant lobbying</keyword><keyword>expertise</keyword><keyword>peddling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1478929919847132</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BOUCHER COOPER Consultant Lobbyists and Public Officials 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Canada</label><abstract>Recent research suggests that there are two different types of lobbyists: those specializing in providing access to their personal connections with public office holders, and those specializing in a particular policy sector. This article advances this research by examining the actual behaviour of consultant lobbyists with data gathered from the Canadian Lobbyist Registry. Specifically, we probe two questions. First, using four indicators found within the literature, we investigate whether the behaviour of consultant lobbyists reflects the well-connected generalist or the issue specialist lobbyist. Second, we examine moving public office holders to see whether administrative officials – who make greater use of technical information – or politicians and partisan advisors – who are more interested in partisan/political information – are more likely to continue to be contacted by consultant lobbyists who contacted them in their previous position. Our results suggest that a more nuanced understanding of lobbying is required. While the majority of activities by consultant lobbyists are consistent with providing expertise to policymakers, a sizable minority of lobbyist activity is consistent with selling access to public office holders. Yet even here, our second analysis suggests that personal relationships may also involve the provision of expertise.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guerra Filho, Arthur</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political influence on Brazilian antitrust enforcement</title><secondary-title>Journal of Antitrust Enforcement</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Antitrust Enforcement</full-title></periodical><pages>78-108</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>antitrust law</keyword><keyword>bureau politics</keyword><keyword>competition authority</keyword><keyword>election</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>political campaign</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><pub-location>GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jaenfo/jnaa043</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Political influence on Brazilian antitrust enforcement - Guerra Filho, Arthur)

But, considering that Cade is an independent agency with a reputation for transparency, how may politicians influence antitrust enforcement? By analysing the responses given to a questionnaire of mine by anonymous former Cade commissioners, as well as other reports related to political influence on the agency and records from Congress, Cade, and other institutions, this article will examine the channels of political influence on Cade. First, I examine channels of democratic control, such as the appointment process. Secondly, by discussing those situations in which politicians approach the agency, I observe that, even in the absence of an explicit promise or threat, contact from politicians bears a special weight for Cade's officers. I argue that, regardless of conclusive evidence that political contact or pressure has actually impacted Cade's enforcement, public confidence in the agency might be harmed when there is the appearance that it has done so. Therefore, the appropriateness of increased transparency surrounding meetings between elected politicians and Cade's officers is a matter for consideration.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nownes, Anthony J.</author><author>Alejandro, Krissy Walker de</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying in the new millennium: Evidence of continuity and change in three states</title><secondary-title>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>429-455</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>UNIV ILLINOIS PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/153244000900900403</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NOWNES ALEJANDRO Lobbying in the New Millennium 2009.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US;state lobbying</label><abstract>We report the results of a survey of over 300 lobbyists in three states-Colorado, Ohio, and West Virginia.

Specifically, we challenge the argument that a “careerists’ premium”—the tendency for public services run by careerists to receive better performance evaluations than services administered by other types of public managers—necessarily is explained by the superior expertise of career bureaucrats. Evidence that forms the basis of this possibility comes from performance evaluations of Korean state-owned enterprises (SOEs) managed by different types of executives between 2000 and 2015. The results of our analyses provide support for the existence of a careerists’ premium. However, we find that the premium is most salient and significant when executives had retired from the governmental agency that oversees the performance-evaluation process. Moreover, the gap between qualitative and quantitative assessment scores increase significantly when the evaluated SOEs are managed by career executives who have retired from the regulating agency. This result suggests that the oft-cited careerists’ premium may not necessarily signify careerists’ greater expertise; it may also be the product of lobbying and regulatory capture.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kopecky, Petr</author><author>Sahling, Jan-Hinrik Meyer</author><author>Panizza, Francisco</author><author>Scherlis, Gerardo</author><author>Schuster, Christian</author><author>Spirova, Maria</author><author>Kopecký, Petr</author><author>Meyer Sahling, Jan Hinrik</author><author>Panizza, Francisco</author><author>Scherlis, Gerardo</author><author>Schuster, Christian</author><author>Spirova, Maria</author><author>Kopecky, Petr</author><author>Sahling, Jan-Hinrik Meyer</author><author>Panizza, Francisco</author><author>Scherlis, Gerardo</author><author>Schuster, Christian</author><author>Spirova, Maria</author><author>Kopecký, Petr</author><author>Meyer Sahling, Jan Hinrik</author><author>Panizza, Francisco</author><author>Scherlis, Gerardo</author><author>Schuster, Christian</author><author>Spirova, Maria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Party patronage in contemporary democracies: Results from an expert survey in 22 countries from five regions</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Political Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Political Research</full-title></periodical><pages>416-431</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>clientelism</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>political appointments</keyword><keyword>political parties</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA</pub-location><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1475-6765.12135</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://KOPECKY SPINOVA Extreme political polarization and party patronage 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.12135</url></web-urls></urls><label>comparative studies;patronage</label><abstract>This Research Note presents a new dataset of party patronage in 22 countries from five regions. The data was collected using the same methodology to compare patterns of patronage within countries, across countries and across world regions that are usually studied separately. The Note addresses three research questions that are at the centre of debates on party patronage, which is understood as the power of political parties to make appointments to the public and semi-public sector: the scope of patronage, the underlying motivations and the criteria on the basis of which appointees are selected. The exploration of the dataset shows that party patronage is, to a different degree, widespread across all regions. The data further shows differences between policy areas, types of institutions such as government ministries, agencies and state-owned enterprises, and higher, middle and lower ranks of the bureaucracy. It is demonstrated that the political control of policy making and implementation is the most common motivation for making political appointments. However, in countries with a large scope of patronage, appointments serve the purpose of both political control and rewarding supporters in exchange for votes and services. Finally, the data shows that parties prefer to select appointees who are characterised by political and personal loyalty as well as professional competence.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boehmke, Frederick J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subverting Administrative Oversight: Campaign Contributions and Nursing Home Inspections</title><secondary-title>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>441-466</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>executive politics</keyword><keyword>health policy</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>legislative/executive interaction</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>parties and interest groups</keyword><keyword>public policy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1532440018789608</electronic-resource-num><notes>Although it refers to states (instead of the national level), it brings a comparative quantiative approach.</notes><research-notes>Although it refers to states (instead of the national level), it brings a comparative quantiative approach.</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BOEHMKE IG Adm Oversight 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>I study the consequences of interest group campaign contributions for administrative oversight. Unlike the few previous studies in this area, however, I study the influence in state bureaucracies and at the level of individual groups. Specifically, I test whether campaign contributions to state elected officials influence the outcomes of annual inspections of skilled nursing facilities in 16 states, leveraging the context of state politics in two important ways. First, I consider the differing effects of contributions to the legislative and executive branches. Second, I argue that legislative capacity for oversight influences the efficacy of contributions Regression analysis of inspection results with controls for facility characteristics provides evidence that contributing facilities have better overall inspection results, with a large reduction in citations for severe problems. Furthermore, contributions to legislators reduce overall problems, particularly in less professionalized legislatures, while those to the governor reduce severe ones.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balla, Steven J.</author><author>Wright, John R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest groups, advisory committees, and congressional control of the bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>799-812</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><publisher>UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/2669325</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Interest groups, advisory committees, and congressional control of the bureaucracy - Balla, Steven J.; Wright, John R.)

We use data on the appointment of members to the National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC), an advisory committee within the Environmental Protection Agency, to test whether the active interests in the legislative debate over drinking water are represented on the advisory committee, and thus in the EPA's policymaking process, Although agency officials are responsible for appointing the members of NDWAC, we find that public endorsements by interest groups are influential in the agency's selection process. These groups provide reliable information to Congress about applicants' true policy preferences.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huber, Gregory A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The craft of bureaucratic neutrality: Interests and influence in governmental regulation of occupational safety</title><secondary-title>The Craft of Bureaucratic Neutrality: Interests and Influence in Governmental Regulation of Occupational Safety</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Craft of Bureaucratic Neutrality: Interests and Influence in Governmental Regulation of Occupational Safety</full-title></periodical><pages>1-256</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><pub-location>Cambridge</pub-location><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><isbn>9780511509841</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/CBO9780511509841</electronic-resource-num><notes>not available</notes><research-notes>not available</research-notes><urls/><abstract>How do interest groups and elected officials affect how government regulators enforce the law?

These restrictions, applicable when one enters private employment after having left government service, are often referred to as revolving door laws. For the most part, other than the narrow restrictions specific to procurement officials, these laws restrict only certain &quot;representational&quot; types of employment activities such as lobbying or advocacy directed to, and which attempts to influence, current federal officials. Under federal conflict of interest law, at 18 U.S.C. § 207, federal employees in the executive branch of government are restricted in performing certain post-employment &quot;representational&quot; activities for private parties, including (1) a lifetime ban on &quot;switching sides,&quot; that is, representing a private party on the same &quot;particular matter&quot; involving identified parties on which the former executive branch employee had worked personally and substantially for the government; (2) a two-year ban on &quot;switching sides&quot; on a somewhat broader range of matters which were under the employee's official responsibility; (3) a one-year restriction on assisting others on certain trade or treaty negotiations; (4) a one-year &quot;cooling off&quot; period for certain &quot;senior&quot; officials barring representational communications to and attempts to influence persons in their former departments or agencies; (5) a new two-year &quot;cooling off&quot; period for &quot;very senior&quot; officials barring representational communications to and attempts to influence certain other high- ranking officials in the entire executive branch of government; and (6) a oneyear ban on certain former high-level officials performing certain representational or advisory activities for foreign governments or foreign political parties. This law also applies the one-year &quot;cooling off&quot; periods, and the restrictions on representations on behalf of official foreign entities and assistance in trade negotiations, in the legislative branch to Members of the House and to senior legislative staff, and applies the two-year &quot;cooling off&quot; period to former U.S. Senators lobbying the Congress. Under the provisions of an executive order issued by President Obama on January 21, 2009, full- time, non-career presidential and vice-presidential appointees in the executive branch, including non-career appointees in the Senior Executive Service, and excepted service confidential, policy- making appointees, will be subject to more extensive post-government-employment &quot;lobbying&quot; restrictions. All such appointees will be barred from &quot;lobbying&quot; any executive branch official &quot;covered&quot; by the Lobbying Disclosure Act (2 U.S.C. § 1602(3)), or any non-career SES appointee, for the remainder of the current Administration. Additionally, all such appointees who are &quot;senior&quot; officials subject to the current one-year &quot;cooling off&quot; period on lobbying and advocacy communications to their former agency, must now abide by such &quot;cooling off&quot; period for two years. Further limitations are placed upon post-government private employment activities of &quot;procurement personnel&quot; in federal agencies. These restrictions go beyond the prohibitions on merely representational, lobbying, or advocacy activities on behalf of private entities before the government after leaving government service, and extend also to any compensated employment for or on behalf of certain private contractors for a period of time after a former procurement official had been responsible for procurement action on certain large contracts for the government. Conflict of interest regulations and restrictions on certain private employment opportunities for a federal officer or employee do not necessarily end with the termination of the officer's or employee's federal service. This report is intended to provide a brief history and description of the provisions of federal law restricting employment opportunities and activities of federal employees after they leave the service of the executive or legislativ branches of the federal government. The conflict of interest provisions applicable after one leaves government service to enter private employment are often referred to as &quot;revolving door&quot; laws.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Awasthi, Kshitij</author><author>George, Rejie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence Capital in Boards: a study of ex-bureaucrats in India</title><secondary-title>Asia Pacific Journal of Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Asia Pacific Journal of Management</full-title></periodical><pages>1525-1559</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>board of directors</keyword><keyword>corporate political activity</keyword><keyword>ex-bureaucrats</keyword><keyword>influence capital'</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Springer</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10490-020-09704-2</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AWASTHI GEORGE Influence Capital Ex Bureaucrats Boards 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077673405&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs10490-020-09704-2&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c13484be70f8e2cf3dd5fdb583a14df7</url></web-urls></urls><label>revolving doors</label><abstract>One of the important roles which firm boards play is the resource provision role. In this study, we examine influence capital, a specific form of resource provision on boards. Two categories of government officials, i.e., Politicians and Bureaucrats tend to be the major providers of influence capital. While firm connections to politicians as board members has been examined in prior literature, connections to bureaucrats (and ex-bureaucrats) has not received the same level of attention. This is despite a sharp increase in the appointment of bureaucrats in company boards in the last few years. We analyze and provide evidence that industry regulation and foreign corporate ownership are major organizational determinants of selection of bureaucrats as board members. Further, it was also imperative to understand the differences in selection of various categories of bureaucrats as board members. We examined and find that generalist bureaucrats are more sought after by firms than specialist bureaucrats, usually as independent directors. Overall, this study provides an important initial thrust for studying bureaucrat board members as providers of influence capital.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rojas Flores, Jorge</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communist officials in the government of gonzález videla, 1946-1947 [Los funcionarios comunistas en el gobierno de gonzález videla, 1946-1947]</title><secondary-title>Cuadernos de Historia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cuadernos de Historia</full-title></periodical><pages>125-173</pages><issue>49</issue><keywords><keyword>Chilean Communist Party</keyword><keyword>Cold War</keyword><keyword>Gabriel González Videla</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Universidad de Chile, Facultad de Filosofia y Humanidades, Departamento de Literatura</publisher><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ROJAS FLORES Los funcionarios comunistas en el gobierno de González Videla 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063209531&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1d264e08a10e8551eceef6cd67376d38</url></web-urls></urls><label>Chile</label><abstract>Communist participation in Gabriel González Videla's Government had one of its most significant milestones the appointment of militants as ministers, mayors, governors and advisers in fiscal and semi-fiscal institutions.

Although the situation turned out to be complex (in transition from anti-fascist struggle to anti-imperialist and anti-oligarchic proposals), experience forced the Chilean Communist Party to seek a way to integrate its governmental responsibilities with its revolutionary vocation, in local and global perspectives.

Despite advances in e-government applications, the public sector lags behind in analytics because information is locked in legacy data formats. Can e-government researchers bridge the gap between legacy data and analytics? We argue that computational analytic methods, popular in big data applications, can explain patterns that have gone unquestioned in previous research on government. Specifically, we consider how explanations of state government authority can be explained using a network perspective. These data were originally designed to describe administrative differences US territories and states. We investigate methodological challenges in building a weighted social network to confirm existing measures for calculating the power of the state governor. This project reports on the initial step in a broader study to cover all 50 states across multiple years and agencies. We compare the states that experienced the greatest differences in gubernatorial appointment power between 1992 and 2012 Texas and Massachusetts. In addition, we identified that Information Systems agencies moved closer to gubernatorial control across all 50 states. Social network analysis improves existing measurements because it indicates the relationship between the governor and other top officials and agencies. An analytics approach explained where the power shifted across states and across time. Computational analysis of existing government data matches findings from previous studies as well as adding additional explanatory power.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Straus, Jacob R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying the executive branch: Current practices and options for change</title><secondary-title>CRS Report.

In January 2009, Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner placed further restrictions on the ability of lobbyists to contact executive branch officials responsible for dispersing Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA, P.L. 110-243) funds. Subsequently, President Barack Obama and Peter Orszag, Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), issued a series of memoranda between March and July 2009 that govern communication between federally registered lobbyists and executive branch employees administering American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) funds. Most recently, in October 2009, the White House directed executive agencies to prohibit, when possible, the appointment of federally registered lobbyists to federal advisory bodies and committees. The Recovery and Reinvestment Act lobbying restrictions focus on both written and oral communications between lobbyists and executive branch officials. Pursuant to the President's memoranda, restrictions have been placed on certain kinds of oral and written interactions between federally registered lobbyists and executive branch officials responsible for Recovery Act fund disbursement. The President's memoranda require each agency to post summaries of oral and written contacts with lobbyists on dedicated agency websites. EESA regulations are virtually identical. This chapter outlines the development of registration requirements for lobbyists engaging executive branch officials since 1995. It also summarizes steps taken by the Obama Administration to limit and monitor lobbying of the executive branch; discusses the development and implementation of restrictions placed on lobbying for Recovery Act and EESA funds; examines the Obama Administration's decision to stop appointing lobbyists to federal advisory bodies and committees; considers third-party criticism of current executive branch lobbying policies; and provides options for possible modifications in current lobbying laws and practices.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyer-Sahling, Jan-Hinrik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The changing colours of the post-communist state: The politicisation of the senior civil service in Hungary</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Political Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Political Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1-33</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00717.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 85</notes><research-notes>cited By 85</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MEYER-SAHLING Politicisation Hungary 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-37349068476&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fj.1475-6765.2007.00717.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b2987fb43ccea418246ceda4b7f9a2fe</url></web-urls></urls><label>Hungary</label><abstract>This article examines claims that senior civil services in post-communist Europe are subject to instability and politicisation, and that both features are at the centre of what amounts to the emergence of a distinct type of executive governance different from Western traditions. At the conceptual level, the article develops four modes of politicisation that differ with respect to the political control over the making and breaking of bureaucratic careers. Modes of politicisation serve as an analytical tool to assess and classify the politicisation of post-communist senior civil services and to compare them to prevailing modes of politicisation in Western democracies as well as the communist past. At the empirical level, the article examines the politicisation of the senior civil service in post-communist Hungary. It argues that the politicisation of the Hungarian senior civil service is characterised by high turnover, recruitment of outsiders and heavy reliance on the appointment of officials who come and go with their bloc of political parties while bridging the out-of-office period in the private sector, academia or at a political party. The article concludes that the politicisation of the senior civil service in post-communist Hungary has more in common with the communist past than with the prevailing modes of politicisation in Western democracies. The main difference from the communist era lies in the periodically changing political colours of the post-communist state.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Joseph Y.

The system is buttressed by the Party's nomenclatura system tightly controlling the appointments of officials at all levels. Local governments officials do not have to be answerable to voters, but they have to undergo detailed performance assessments annually by their superiors within the Party state. Local governments in China, assume a significant role in economic development. They own enterprises and also compete against each other, for example, they all try to attract more foreign investment. Chinese people are increasingly concerned with environmental pollution, food security, health care reforms, education reforms, etc. These are the new tests for local government leaders.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fleischer, Julia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Partisan and professional control: Predictors of bureaucratic tenure in Germany</title><secondary-title>Acta Politica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Politica</full-title></periodical><pages>433-450</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Germany</keyword><keyword>bureaucratic tenure</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>politicisation</keyword><keyword>survival analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1057/s41269-016-0006-0</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 8</notes><research-notes>cited By 8</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://FLEISCHER Partisan and professional control Germany 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016190905&amp;doi=10.1057%2Fs41269-016-0006-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7fa297c907ce37e477bf51eb27791812</url></web-urls></urls><label>Germany</label><abstract>This paper analyses the patterns of bureaucratic tenure of the German federal bureaucratic elite. It applies a delegation theory and a Public Service Bargain perspective and argues that partisan and professional determinants influence the bureaucratic tenure. Our survival analysis shows that partisan features matter, yet differently than suggested by existing research: top officials affiliated with the minister's party have a significant higher risk of dismissal than those affiliated to other parties and non-partisans. In contrast, the temporal proximity between ministerial and top official appointments has no significant effects on bureaucratic tenure. In addition, professional determinants shape bureaucratic survival. Whereas the minister's office experience is insignificant for bureaucratic survival, the top official's office experience has significant and negative effects on the risk of dismissal: individuals with prior experience in managing bureaucratic apparatuses survive longer than those without such office experience. We conclude that German ministers are more likely to dismiss senior civil servants due to their unsatisfying office experience than their incongruent or lacking partisan affiliation. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Levinson, Chad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gilt by Associations: Appointments to Federal Advisory Committees in U.S. National Security Politics</title><secondary-title>Presidential Studies Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Presidential Studies Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>97-129</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Federal Advisory Committee</keyword><keyword>civil society</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>national security</keyword><keyword>presidential power</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/psq.12491</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LEVINSON Appointments to Federal Advisory Committees in US 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058369170&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fpsq.12491&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7d0b7212825268c851368ae1ab71e3a0</url></web-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Federal Advisory Committees (FACs) offer opportunities for private citizens to gain access to the national security apparatus of the U.S. government.

As each emergent value has gained political strength, its increased importance has been reflected in the forming of corresponding public personnel systems and their related techniques. Traditionally, conflict in the United States has centered around four fundamental values: political responsiveness, organizational efficiency and effectiveness, individual rights, and social equity. Political responsiveness is the belief that government answers to the will of the people expressed through elected officials, and the public workforce must, in turn, be made to answer to those in elective office. In a system grounded on this value, the political and personal faithfulness of public employees may best be ensured through an appointment process that considers political loyalty, along with education and experience, as indicators of merit. Often, in order to promote responsive government, elected officials are authorized to fill certain jobs through political appointments. Organizational efficiency and effectiveness reflect the desire on the part of elected officials and the public to maximize productivity. This suggests that employment decisions about whom to hire, reassign, or promote should be based on applicants' and employees' competencies, rather than on their political loyalty. The concept of individual rights suggests that citizens must be protected from unfair actions of government officials. In the context of civil service systems, public employees' rights to job security and due process are maintained through merit system rules and regulations that protect them from inappropriate partisan political pressure. In parallel fashion, public employees who are union members will have recourse to work rules contained in collective bargaining agreements that protect them from arbitrary management decisions. Social equity as a personnel value places emphasis on fairness to groups such as women, racial minorities, the disabled, and veterans, which may otherwise be disadvantaged by a market economy that accepts the legitimacy of discrimination in hiring and in pay. As is the case with individual rights as a principal value, social equity is concerned with fairness. But unlike individual rights, which are based on personal attributes like education, experience, or seniority, social equity is concerned with employment preferences based on membership in a protected class or group. Within the past quarter century, these four traditional values have been supplemented by increasingly powerful emergent &quot;antigovernment&quot; values. Early evidence of the rise of these values is found in the 1976 presidential campaign, won by Jimmy Carter, who ran against the national government as a Washington &quot;outsider.&quot; Following the election, Carter proposed the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act on grounds that included poor performance in the public service and difficulty in controlling and directing bureaucrats. Beginning in 1980, the Reagan administration, though starting from fundamentally different values and policy objectives, continued to cast government as part of the problem, and to campaign against the infrastructure of public agencies and public administrators. The ascendant anti-government assumptions behind this shift were paralleled by a related general transition from political to economic perspectives on public policy. That transition emphasized the role of market forces on individuals and the economy, rather than program implementation by government agencies and employees, as the most efficacious tools of public policy (Beckett 2000). Economic perspectives and the value of administrative efficiency clearly placed intense political pressure on the public sector to &quot;do more with less.&quot; The pressure to do more caused government to attempt to become more accountable through such techniques as program budgeting, management by objectives, program evaluation, and management information systems. The pressure to do more with less money caused governments to lower expenditures through tax and expenditure ceilings, deficit reduction, deferred expenditures, accelerated tax collection, service fees, user charges, and a range of legislative and judicial efforts to shift program responsibilities and costs away from each affected government. Since from 50 to 75 percent of public expenditures go toward employee salaries and benefits, efforts to increase accountability and reduce costs have necessarily focused to a large extent on the field of public personnel management. These underlying contemporary political and economic forces shaped three specific emerging anti-government values with implications for personnel policy: individual accountability, limited and decentralized government, and community responsibility for social services. First, proponents of individual accountability expect that people will make individual choices consistent with their own goals, and accept responsibility for the consequences of these choices, rather than passing responsibility for their actions onto the rest of society. Second, proponents of limited and decentralized government believe, fundamentally, that government is to be feared for its power to arbitrarily or capriciously deprive individuals of their rights. Advocates of this view also believe that it is easier to connect public policy, service delivery, and revenue generation in a smaller rather than larger unit of government. Decision makers are known, revenues are predictable, and services are directly visible in such circumstances, and for some, the reduction in size and scope of government is justified by the perceived ineffectiveness of government; by the high value accorded to individual freedom, responsibility and accountability; and by a reluctance to devote a greater share of personal income to taxes. Third, proponents of community responsibility for social services believe that local government agencies need to be supplemented by not-for-profit, nongovernmental organizations responsible for social services, recreation, and community development activities. For public personnel management, the most significant consequence of this value has been the creation of thousands of nonprofit organizations that routinely provide services funded by taxes, user fees, and charitable contributions. These forces-mistrust of government and increased reliance on market mechanisms-have significantly affected public management at state and local government levels as well as the federal level. In 1993 the National Commission on the State and Local Public Service, generally referred to as the Winter Commission after its chair William Winter, issued a report that was generally critical of traditional public personnel management practices. An essential tenet of that report was that while civil service systems had traditionally been designed to promote efficiency and employee rights by protecting the public service against political interference and patronage-based turnover, these systems had gradually evolved to a point where &quot;red tape&quot; had overly restricted management flexibility, and due process had unreasonably protected incompetent or insubordinate employees. Its fifth recommendation called for an &quot;end to civil service paralysis&quot; through the adoption of practices designed to make personnel management more responsive to executive leadership, more supportive of innovation and risk-taking, and more rewarding of performance (National Commission on the State and Local Public Service 1993, Thompson 1994). © 2006 State University of New York.

Based on extensive empirical research and statistical data, this article provides an in-depth analysis of the status and position of administrative managers, which is intended to serve as a test whether the apex of the Slovenian administrative system is politicized and in what form. In the so-called new democracies, politicization most often is manifested as a violation of the principles of political neutrality characteristic of a professional civil service, through personalized and biased appointments of senior civil servants and in the low degree of protection against lay-offs of civil servants on political grounds. Administrative managers thus often have to decide between political susceptibility and trustworthiness versus professionalism and professional accountability, for their tasks belong to the administrative and political realms. This poses a question about the degree of influence politicians exert on administrative managers and the rate of success with which administrative managers manage to retain their professionalism and independence, which should represent the key characteristics of a senior civil servant.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buckley, Noah</author><author>Reuter, Ora John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performance Incentives under Autocracy: Evidence from Russia's Regions</title><secondary-title>COMPARATIVE POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>COMPARATIVE POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>239+</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>COMPARATIVE POLITICS, PO BOX 465, HANOVER, PA 17331 USA</pub-location><publisher>SHERIDAN PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5129/001041519825256560</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BUCKLEY REUTER Performance Incentives under Autocracy 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Russia;political appointments</label><abstract>Available evidence indicates that there is considerable variation among autocracies in the extent to which subnational officials are rewarded for economic growth. Why is economic performance used as a criterion for appointment in some autocracies but not in others? We argue that in more competitive though still autocratic regimes, the political imperatives of maintaining an electoral machine that can win semi-competitive elections leads regime leaders to abandon cadre policies that promote economic development. Using data on turnover among high-level economic bureaucrats in Russia's 89 regions between 2001 and 2012, we find that performance-based appointments are more frequent in less competitive regions. These findings demonstrate one way that semi-competitive elections can actually undermine economic development under autocracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brock, K</author><author>Shepherd, R P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Trudeau government and GIC appointments in Canada</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Public Sector Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Public Sector Management</full-title></periodical><pages>463-479</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>GIC appointments</keyword><keyword>merit</keyword><keyword>new public governance</keyword><keyword>politicization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1108/IJPSM-07-2021-0182</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BROCK SHEPHERD Political Appointments in Canada 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122368821&amp;doi=10.1108%2FIJPSM-07-2021-0182&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=91b944e7f21211511a951bcab2a601ba</url></web-urls></urls><label>Canada;political appointments</label><abstract>Purpose: According to the traditional view of public administration, a critical component of good policy formulation is the provision of frank and fearless advice to elected decision-makers. This advice can be provided by permanent public officials or by the people selected by the elected governments to fill key and continuing posts. However, there are major questions as to whether new Governor-in-Council (GIC) appointment processes rooted in new public governance (NPG) are yielding the expected results promised, such as less partisanism, as a consideration for appointment. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a mixed methods approach to examine the GIC process as it is used in Canada. In using these methods, the authors employed interviews with senior officials, governmental documents review and expert validation interviews to triangulate its main findings. Findings: The paper uses the case of the revised appointment process for GIC appointments in Canada and suggests that the new arrangements do not deliver on merit-based criteria that ensures independence is protected between political executive and senior bureaucratic officials. Although new processes may be more open and transparent than past processes, the paper suggests that such processes are more susceptible to partisan influence under the guise of being merit-based. Research limitations/implications: The research was limited to one country context, Canada. As such, it will be necessary to expand this to other Westminster countries. Testing whether manifestations of new public governance in appointment processes elsewhere will be important to validate whether Canada is unique or not. Practical implications: The authors are left to wonder if this innovation of merit-based appointments in the new administrative state is obscuring the lines of accountability and whether it forms the basis for good policy advice despite promises to the contrary. Social implications: Trust in the government is affected by decisions behind closed doors. They appear partisan, even when they may not be. Process matters if only to highlight increased value placed on meritorious appointments. Originality/value: Previous studies on GIC appointments have generally been to explore representation as a value. That is, studies have questioned whether diversity is maintained, for example. However, few studies have explored appointment processes using institutional approaches to examine whether reforms to such processes have respected key principles, such as merit and accountability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Doyon, Jerome</author><author>Keller, Franziska Barbara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Knowing the Wrong Cadre?

Studies of political elite's rise to power stress the importance of personal ties, but do not consider the possibility of differential effects depending on who one is connected to in elite struggles. We examine how ties formed among Chinese party-state officials influence their career. Our research design provides a strong proxy to account for personal ties: attendance of an exclusive and intensive training program for officials. We take advantage of the exogenous assignment to cohorts in this program to establish a causal link between informal connections and promotions. We find that the effect of personal ties depends on whether the official is connected to the leader who dominates the promotion process or to the one who only influences it through information control. Connections to the latter decrease the promotion probability, likely because these officials are closely monitored by their superiors and more powerful rivals.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gyampo, Ransford E V</author><author>Graham, Emmanuel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>REVIEWING THE EXTENSIVE APPOINTMENT POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT AS SOLUTION TO WINNER-TAKES ALL POLITICS IN GHANA</title><secondary-title>GHANA SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GHANA SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>166-197</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>2, SI</issue><keywords><keyword>Ghana</keyword><keyword>Winner-Takes-All Politics</keyword><keyword>appointment</keyword><keyword>clientelism</keyword><keyword>executive</keyword><keyword>powers</keyword><keyword>president</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>ECOLOGICAL LAB, BOX LG 59, LEGON, 00000, GHANA</pub-location><publisher>UNIV GHANA</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GYAMPO GRAHAM Reviewing the Powers of Ghanas President as Solution to Winner-Takes-All Politics.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Ghana</label><abstract>The 1992 constitution of Ghana gives the Executive President of Ghana enormous and extensive powers of appointment. This over the years has led to the manifestations of the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) politics. As a result, Executive Presidents of Ghana have exercised their powers of appointment to the benefit of only party apparatchiks and loyalists without recourse to appointment based on apolitical or non-partisan meritocracy. In this regard, many Ghanaians, irrespective of their competence, experience and expertise, are denied the opportunity to serve their country simply because they do not belong to the ruling party. We argue that, the 1992 constitution of Ghana gives the Executive President so much power in appointing state officials, which promotes WTA politics and deepens clientelism. The paper reviews the extensive powers of appointment of the President and practically examines how the exercise of these powers promotes WTA politics and clientelism. It discusses previous attempts at promoting inclusive government through appointments and the challenges encountered. The paper finally proffers policy recommendations on how the powers of appointment could be exercised in a manner that promotes inclusivity and, to some extent, meritocracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Snyder, Neil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>American Civil-Military Relations and Presidential Power of Removal</title><secondary-title>ARMED FORCES \&amp; SOCIETY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ARMED FORCES \&amp; SOCIETY</full-title></periodical><pages>1-34</pages><volume>00</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>civil–military relations</keyword><keyword>democracy</keyword><keyword>political science</keyword><keyword>professionalism/leadership</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA</pub-location><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0095327X221100270</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SNYDER Civil military relations Predident Power Removal 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US;civil-military relations</label><abstract>Under what conditions are presidents more likely to remove senior defense officials from office? Using a novel data set of all senior U.S. defense officials, both civilian and uniformed military from 1947 to 2021, this article explores whether anticipated support in Congress, partisan factors, or institutional protections for the military affect observed patterns of removal for defense officials. The results suggest that presidents are more likely to remove their own appointees (or their co-partisans' appointees), but provide little evidence that presidents premise removal on anticipated partisan support for a replacement nominee in Congress. Moreover, the results suggest that military officials may have some insulation from politicization by strong forms of removal, though that protection may weaken an important aspect of civilian control of the military, the threat of punishment by removal, raising profound questions for how civilian control endures.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McTavish, Duncan</author><author>Pyper, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring the public appointments process in the UK - Issues and themes surrounding the use of semi-independent commissioners</title><secondary-title>PUBLIC MANAGEMENT REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PUBLIC MANAGEMENT REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>145-153</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>accountability</keyword><keyword>commissioners</keyword><keyword>governance</keyword><keyword>independence</keyword><keyword>ministers</keyword><keyword>public appointments</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><pub-location>4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \&amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14719030601181290</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MCTAVISH PYPER Monitoring public appointments UK 2007.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>UK;public appointments to boards</label><abstract>The system for monitoring, regulating and reporting on the way in which UK government ministers make appointments to the boards of public bodies is a relatively neglected area of public management.

The core hypothesis: all three types of organizations have substantial impacts on policy. The other three: (1) when public opinion is taken into account, the political organizations do not have such an impact; (2) parties have a greater impact than interest groups and SMOs; and (3) interest groups and SMOs will affect policy only to the extent that their activities provide elected officials with information and resources relevant to their election campaigns. The source of data is articles published in major sociology and political science journals from 1990 to 2000, systematically coded to record the impact of organizations on policy. The major findings include: political organizations affect policy no more than half the time; parties and nonparty organizations affect policy about equally often; there is some evidence that organizational activities that respond to the electoral concerns of elected officials are especially likely to have an impact.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Govorun, A</author><author>Marques I., I I</author><author>Pyle, W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The political roots of intermediated lobbying: Evidence from Russian enterprises and business associations</title><secondary-title>Business and Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Business and Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>395-433</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Walter de Gruyter GmbH</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1515/bap-2015-0032</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 4</notes><research-notes>cited By 4</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GOVORUN ET AL The political roots of intermediated lobbying 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018780373&amp;doi=10.1515%2Fbap-2015-0032&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=088c6a06f7b8ed8666402ba41a2206e3</url></web-urls></urls><label>Russia</label><abstract>A business enterprise interested in influencing the design, adoption or enforcement of a particular law, rule or regulation often confronts a choice. Does it lobby officials directly? Or does it do so indirectly, using a collective action group as an intermediary? We draw on data from a large, 2010 survey of enterprises across the Russian Federation to demonstrate that the propensity to engage in intermediated lobbying increases with region-level political competition. Our explanation builds on recent evidence confirming Mancur Olson's claim (1982) that less encompassing actors tend to lobby for more distortionary policies. We hypothesize that with greater political competition government officials become more responsive to encompassing voices (i.e. associations of businesses as opposed to single firms), since the electoral costs of being captured by narrower interests becomes greater. Evidence from a complementary survey of regional business association managers points in the same direction; the relative attention paid by officials to lobbying efforts by encompassing associations increases with political competition.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Albareda, Adrià</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prioritizing professionals?

The EU has long emphasized the importance of interacting with representative groups that involve their members. Additionally, there is an increasing trend toward the professionalization of groups that invest in organizational capacities to efficiently provide policy expertise. Both member involvement and organizational capacity are crucial features for groups to function as transmission belts that aggregate and transfer the preferences of their members to policymakers, thus reinforcing the legitimacy and efficiency of governance systems. Yet, not all groups have these organizational attributes. This paper quantitatively examines the effects of interest groups' investment in member involvement and organizational capacity on the level of access to EU Commission officials. The results indicate that member involvement does not pay off in terms of higher levels of access. In contrast, groups with high organizational capacities have more meetings with public officials of the Commission.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gaucher-Holm, Alexa</author><author>Mulligan, Christine</author><author>L’Abbé, Mary R.</author><author>Potvin Kent, Monique</author><author>Vanderlee, Lana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying and nutrition policy in Canada: a quantitative descriptive study on stakeholder interactions with government officials in the context of Health Canada’s Healthy Eating Strategy</title><secondary-title>Globalization and Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Globalization and Health</full-title></periodical><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>corporate political activity</keyword><keyword>industry</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>nutrition policy</keyword><keyword>public health policy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12992-022-00842-4</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GAUCHER-HOLM ET AL Lobbying and Nutrition Policy in Canada 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130686402&amp;doi=10.1186%2Fs12992-022-00842-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=988bb74c24cdff0f55832132bf1b65c1</url></web-urls></urls><label>Canada</label><abstract>Background: The political activities of industry stakeholders must be understood to safeguard the development and implementation of effective public health policies. Methods: A quantitative descriptive study was performed using data from Canada’s Registry of Lobbyists to examine the frequency and governmental target of lobbying that occurred between various types of stakeholders (i.e., industry versus non-industry) and designated public office holders (DPOH) regarding Health Canada’s Healthy Eating Strategy, from September/2016 to January/2021. Initiatives of interest were revisions to Canada’s Food Guide, changes to the nutritional quality of the food supply, front-of-pack nutrition labelling and restrictions on food marketing to children. Results: The majority of registrants (88%), and corporations and organizations (90%) represented in lobbying registrations had industry ties. Industry-affiliated stakeholders were responsible for 86% of communications with DPOH, interacting more frequently with DPOH of all ranks, compared to non-industry stakeholders. Most organizations and corporations explicitly registered to lobby on the topic of marketing to children (60%), followed by Canada’s Food Guide (48%), front-of-pack nutrition labelling (44%), and the nutritional quality of the food supply (23%). The food and beverage industry, particularly the dairy industry, was the most active, accounting for the greatest number of lobbying registrations and communications, followed by the media and communication industry. Conclusions: Results suggest a strategic advantage of industry stakeholders in influencing Canadian policymakers. While some safeguards have been put in place, increased transparency would allow for a better understanding of industry discourse and help protect public health interests during the policy development process. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Böhmelt, Tobias</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Civil society lobbying and countries' climate change policies: A matching approach</title><secondary-title>Climate Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>698-717</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>ENGOs</keyword><keyword>UNFCCC</keyword><keyword>business groups</keyword><keyword>civil society</keyword><keyword>climate policy</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Taylor and Francis Ltd.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14693062.2013.788870</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 10</notes><research-notes>cited By 10</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BÖHMELT Civil society lobbying 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886409740&amp;doi=10.1080%2F14693062.2013.788870&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b2816a3c906e196993ae191e782e9daf</url></web-urls></urls><label>international lobbying</label><abstract>Does civil society lobbying affect states' policies on climate change? Does it facilitate or hamper cooperation towards 'greener' policies? Environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) and business lobbying groups alike are increasingly seeking to access states' negotiation delegations at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in order to affect or even change official delegates' policies. Previous studies have failed to control for the fact that the set of states that have granted civil society access to their delegations is unlikely to be a random sample. Moreover, the fact that a delegation's policy outputs may converge with the preferences of a civil society group cannot be taken as evidence that it was caused by civil society lobbying. A matching approach that addresses both problems is proposed, which corrects for the non-random assignment of civil society organizations to state delegations and forms quasi-experimental contrasts by sampling a set of 'most similar' cases that only differ in their treatment; i.e. civil society lobbying. This approach facilitates a causal interpretation of lobbying efforts. The results indicate that only business groups are likely to exert a causal influence on states' climate delegations. However, contrary to expectations, these groups appear to have enhanced states' efforts towards environmentally friendly policies.Policy relevanceWhat impact can non-governmental actors have in influencing states' policies at the climate change negotiations? This question is addressed empirically using a matching approach, which corrects potential challenges in the research on interest group influence. It is shown that business groups are likely to influence states' policies at the UNFCCC - unlike green interest groups or civil society in general. In light of these findings, three policy implications are derived that might be of importance for states and non-governmental decision makers alike. Most importantly, ENGOs should refocus their efforts for exerting their influence. ENGOs could make their lobbying more effective by first identifying the states that may be more receptive to their preferences and positions.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paddock, Joel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest group influence on the ideological orientations of local party activists</title><secondary-title>Social Science Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Social Science Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>734-741</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.soscij.2007.10.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://PADDOCK Interest Group and Party Activists 2007.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36549058620&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.soscij.2007.10.002&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=587cdbc399c5001873e2e2047d2364a7</url></web-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>This paper uses a national survey of local Democratic and Republican Party officials to determine the extent to which interest group attempts to develop a formal organizational presence within the grassroots Democratic and Republican parties might push the parties towards taking more ideologically extreme positions.

The survey results provide support for the hypothesis. Group-influenced party activists tend to be more ideologically extreme than other party officials. However, while a large percentage of Democratic and Republican local party officials are members of interest groups, only a relatively small percentage reported being recruited to party activism through their group involvement.

The result is an unjust regulation or the absence of regulation where this is necessary for the protection of the common good. When policies affect commercial determinants of health, such as alcohol, tobacco, sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed foods, this is known as corporate capture of public health. Capture-related actions are targeted at civil society, experts, public-health officials, and politicians, and can assume different forms, ranging from material (revolving doors) to intellectual (distortion of science), social (control of information) and/or cultural (by reason of the group identity, status and relationship of the regulator with the representatives of private corporations). The capture strategies are aimed at: 1) biasing scientific results; 2) creating consumers from an early age; 3) promoting a good image of corporations; 4) questioning the legitimacy and appropriateness of governmental regulation; 5) controlling professional education; and 6) lobbying on governments and international bodies. To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyse a paradigmatic case of corporate capture of public health, namely, Spanish nutritional policies since the approval in 2005 of the «Strategy for Nutrition, Physical Activity and Prevention of Obesity (NAOS)». In Spain, a sector of the scientific community and those in charge of nutritional policies have not only succumbed to the interests of private corporations, but have also adopted the latter’s line of reasoning as their own, thereby becoming a mouthpiece for corporate interests.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dulitzky, Alejandro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Between the lobby and the podium.

The processes of American governance-from the activities of interest groups and political parties to the often Byzantine operations of lawmakers-are readily penetrated by the strong, clear, and frequent political voices of privileged and highly active citizens. Differences in the abilities of individual citizens and groups to set the policy agenda, frame debates, and adapt to institutional processes prompts governing institutions to respond unevenly to the concerns and preferences of American citizens. Yet the governing process is not simply a mechanical cash register that tabulates the unequal political voices of the advantaged and organized. Entrenched institutional norms, patterns of behavior, and collective conceptions of purposes and goals interact with the struggle for political power among rival individuals and government bodies to prevent any single group or set of ideas from consistently steering government decisionmaking in one direction. The most persistent impact of stratified political participation is to reinforce the enduring bias of the American political process toward &quot;deadlock and delay&quot;-as the framers of the U.S. constitution and James Madison intended (Burns 1963). The recent growth in economic inequality appears to be increasing the power of individuals and groups who have a stake in doing little or nothing about substantially counteracting disparities based on income and wealth. American government is characterized by a level of individualization and lack of authoritative lines of control that makes it particularly ill suited to respond to a broad, aggregate phenomenon such as economic inequality by consistently enacting effective remedial policies. The American political process is geared toward particularistic, piecemeal issues rather than the big picture. Politicians and government may respond to the rising income and wealth of a small proportion of citizens in a thousand little (and not so little) ways, but they are not likely to consistently do so in one big way. Even if officeholders were generally motivated to enact egalitarian tax and spending policies to stem the rising tide of economic inequality, their efforts to significantly change these policies would likely run into the kind of collective action problems that have stalled efforts on environmental protection, heath care, and homeland security. The bias in the American political process toward inaction and responding to pressure from well-organized particularistic groups has created multiple and competing centers of influence and a corresponding patchwork of contradictory and incomplete economic and social welfare policies. One of the most demonstrable developments in the United States over the past half century has been the expansion of civil and political rights and, specifically, equality of opportunity in the economic realm and procedural equality in the political realm. Historically entrenched racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination has been challenged and the presence of previously underrepresented groups in the policymaking process has modestly expanded as a result. The ostensible aims of equity have been shaped, however, by the entrenched bias in the American political process to produce social rights for concrete and discrete groups such as seniors or the poor. The broader claims for establishing universal social rights and delivering substantive political and economic equality to all citizens lacked the intense support of powerful encompassing groups and institutional allies and clashed with the trajectory of American political development toward ensuring equality of opportunity more than equality of results. The consequence is that rising economic inequality has neither expanded nor reduced political inequality, nor even produced a dramatic redirection of overall government policy in the egalitarian or antiegalitarian direction. The pitched political battles over the past several decades and partisan cycles of frustrations and mobilizations have fueled the polarization of the Democratic and Republican parties and intimidated even the Democratic Party from energetically promoting the kind of egalitarian programs that some of its activists favor. This chapter-which is divided into four parts-is based on a review of existing research on American governing institutions, political organizations, and the making of public policy. Our review was undertaken with an eye to identifying continuity and change in who makes government policy, how, and to what effect. In particular, we examined research on whether and how political influences on government policy reflects enduring disparities in political voice and has changed as economic inequality has risen and long entrenched racial, ethnic, and gender inequalities have been challenged. We begin by acknowledging limitations on our efforts to evaluate the potential impact of unequal power in the making of public policy. The second section describes the broad institutional context of policymaking in the United States, including the complexities of the legislative process, federalism, and the nature of party politics. The third section outlines the role of interest groups and the impact of money in elections and in the policymaking process. The last section examines biases in political representation, with particular emphasis on whether patterns of unequal influence have altered in recent decades either with changing patterns of economic inequality or with expansions of civil and political rights.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maskell, Jack</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying congress: An overview of legal provisions and congressional ethics rules</title><secondary-title>CRS Report for Congress.

The report provides a summary discussion of the federal lobbying registration and disclosure requirements of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended by the &quot;Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007,&quot; P.L. 110-81 (S. 1, 110th Congress); the Foreign Agents Registration Act; the issue of the propriety of contingency fees for lobbying; restrictions on lobbying with federal funds; post-employment (&quot;revolving door&quot;) lobbying activities by former federal officials; and House and Senate ethics rules relevant to contacts with private lobbyists. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 was enacted to replace a nearly 50-year old lobbying registration law that was seen as vague and inadequate. The current lobbying registration and disclosure provisions establish clearer criteria and thresholds for determining when an organization should register its employees or staff as lobbyists or when a lobbying firm or individual lobbyist needs to register and identify clients. The act is directed at professional lobbyists, that is, those who receive payments to lobby for an employer or a client, and requires the registration and reporting of certain identifying information and general, broad financial data. In addition to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the Foreign Agents Registration Act requires the registration and reporting from those who act as agents of a foreign government or foreign political party, and who engage in &quot;lobbying&quot; or other similar political advocacy activities on behalf of their foreign principal. Various provisions of federal law have been enacted and regulations promulgated to restrict the use of any federal funds for lobbying purposes, either by the agencies of the federal government or by federal contractors or grantees. In attempts to limit what has been perceived to be potential undue or improper influence in governmental processes, restrictions have been adopted to limit the post-employment lobbying of certain high ranking officials of the federal government for a period of time after they leave government service (&quot;revolving door&quot; laws). Additionally, to deal with similar perceptions of undue or improper influence and access, both Houses of Congress have adopted internal rules regarding the acceptance of gifts and favors by Members, officers or employees of the House or Senate from private sources, particularly from registered lobbyists or agents of foreign principals, or their clients. No gifts may be accepted by Members, officers, or employees except as permitted in the rules of the respective chamber; and thus even small gifts, as well as more significant travel expenses for conferences or &quot;fact finding&quot; events provided to congressional Members and staff from private parties such as lobbyists and their clients, are regulated and restricted by the provisions of House and Senate rule. Under the new &quot;ethics and lobbying&quot; law (P.L. 110-81), registered lobbyists must be familiar with these restrictions and regulations on gifts to Members of Congress in House and Senate rules, and must certify to the Government that they have not offered gifts or things of value to Members or staff which would violate these rules. This chapter is intended to provide a brief overview and summary of the federal laws, ethical rules, and regulations which may be relevant to the activities of those who lobby the United States Congress. The report provides a summary discussion of the federal lobbying registration and disclosure requirements of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) (as amended by the &quot;Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007&quot; (P.L. 110-81, September 14, 2007)), the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the propriety of contingency fees for lobbying, restrictions on lobbying with federal funds, post-employment (&quot;revolving door&quot;) lobbying activities by former federal officials, and House and Senate ethics rules which may be relevant to certain contacts by Members, officers, and employees of Congress with private lobbyists and their clients.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mahoney, Christine</author><author>Baumgartner, Frank R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Partners in advocacy: Lobbyists and Government Officials in Washington</title><secondary-title>Journal of Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>202-215</pages><volume>77</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/678389</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 45</notes><research-notes>cited By 45</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MAHONEY BAUMGARTNER Lobbyists and Government Officials in Washington 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84973573729&amp;doi=10.1086%2F678389&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=52755c0983410a06b3b417445c305b7a</url></web-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>One of the most important demonstrations of power in Washington is the ability to recruit sitting government officials to become active proponents of one's position. Many have suggested money is the key: Campaign contributions buy friends, access, and perhaps even policy activism. We provide an alternative view based on a deceptively simple observation: Lobbyists rarely lobby alone. We show empirically that government policymakers respond to the overall structure of conflict, not the resources of individual lobbying groups. Our project is based on in-depth interviews with over 300 policy advocates and systematic information on each of more than 2,000 advocates playing a significant role in a random sample of 98 policy issues in the United States federal government from 1999 to 2002.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karol, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>American political parties: Exceptional no more</title><secondary-title>Solutions to Political Polarization in America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Solutions to Political Polarization in America</full-title></periodical><pages>208-217</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><isbn>9781316091906; 9781107087118</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/CBO9781316091906.015</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 5</notes><research-notes>cited By 5</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://KAROL American Political Parties 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953237349&amp;doi=10.1017%2FCBO9781316091906.015&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fb75eb8a41e22a1321c9db48609c377e</url></web-urls></urls><label>US;relationship between parties and interest groups</label><abstract>To understand polarization we must understand political parties. Polarization is often considered abnormal and even pathological. Yet this assumption is questionable. Polarization is typically defined as growing cohesion in the policy stands of parties' officials, activists, and voters and divergence in parties' policies (Fiorina and Abrams 2008). A comparative and historical perspective reveals that cohesive parties with divergent policy positions are common in stable democracies. Parties draw support from different societal interests, taking on divergent policy positions as a result (Karol 2009). Party competition also generates “teamsmanship” (Lee 2009), as politicians seek to discredit the other side while claiming credit for themselves. As a result, clear divisions between parties are the norm. In countries other than the United States, however, strong parties do not produce the dysfunction now visible in Washington. The problem is the mismatch between polarized parties and the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers. This tension was obscured for decades when parties were atypically divided and, earlier still, when the American state did little. The parties' increasing cohesion was unplanned, as was their mid-twentieth-century eclipse. Polarization may abate again, but there is little reason to believe such a development is imminent or that tinkering with redistricting, primaries, and campaign finance law will hasten it. Recognition of polarization's durability could eventually produce openness to reforms that are now beyond reach, such as a move toward a parliamentary system. In the medium term, however, abolishing the filibuster is a more realistic goal. AMERICAN PARTIES: PAST AND PRESENT Traditionally, political scientists have seen American parties as pragmatic and election oriented. For some leading party scholars, parties and interest groups were competing forms of political organization. E. E. Schattschneider saw the American political system plagued by “pressure groups” that he thought disproportionally represented the wealthy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharafutdinova, G</author><author>Turovsky, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The politics of federal transfers in Putin’s Russia: regional competition, lobbying, and federal priorities</title><secondary-title>Post-Soviet Affairs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Post-Soviet Affairs</full-title></periodical><pages>161-175</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>administrative capacity</keyword><keyword>federal transfers</keyword><keyword>intergovernmental financial f lows</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>russian federation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Routledge</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/1060586X.2016.1163826</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 24</notes><research-notes>cited By 24</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SHARAFUTDINOVA TUROVSKY The politics of federal transfers in Putins Russia 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962110851&amp;doi=10.1080%2F1060586X.2016.1163826&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ded40a744d1ca5380a9e62a3719bca6f</url></web-urls></urls><label>Russia</label><abstract>Most studies of intergovernmental financial flows in the Russian Federation focus on the federal center’s decision-making in determining the direction of these flows. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that regional governments employ a variety of tools and strategies to compete over federal transfers. This study uses data on federal transfers during 2002–2012 to examine the factors associated with the politically sensitive share of such transfers occurring in this period. The key findings highlight the importance of administrative capacity and the value of attracting attention from, as well as cultivating relations with, federal officials for shaping decision-making on the distribution of federal transfers. We discuss some specific strategies used by more successful regional governments in attracting additional federal funds.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yates, Stéphanie</author><author>Cardin-Trudeau, Étienne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying “from within”: A new perspective on the revolving door and regulatory capture</title><secondary-title>Canadian Public Administration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Public Administration</full-title></periodical><pages>301-319</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Public Administration of Canada</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/capa.12412</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://YATES CARDIN-TRUDEAU Lobbying Capture Revolving Doors 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111456352&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fcapa.12412&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=94056d5435ce968c91ff35461ebb280c</url></web-urls></urls><label>Quebec;revolving doors</label><abstract>This study explores the revolving door phenomenon–when public office holders move back and forth from the public to the private sector, often becoming lobbyists–and its implications on regulatory capture. It draws on the literature on regulatory capture theory and 46 interviews conducted in Quebec with public officers (ministers, chiefs of staff, deputy ministers, and heads of governmental organizations) whose career path includes a revolving door scenario, as well as observers of the phenomenon. New light is shed on capture theory by using a broad definition of the revolving door that focuses on the entry stage. A key finding is that “cultural capture” can occur when new public officers come from the same private sector now within their purview. Based on public officers’ allegiance to their former industry, lobbying is de facto exerted, “from within.” Despite clear irregularities and conflicts of interest, most of those interviewed do not believe in tightening rules and prefer continuing with vigilance from public office holders, journalists, and other observers.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baumgartner, Frank R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EU lobbying: A view from the US</title><secondary-title>Journal of European Public Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of European Public Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>482-488</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>European Union</keyword><keyword>framing</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>issue-definition</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>policy processes</keyword><keyword>venue shopping</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/13501760701243830</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 49</notes><research-notes>cited By 49</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BAUMGARTNER EU Lobbying 2007.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33947693241&amp;doi=10.1080%2F13501760701243830&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=842ff06e9915eef2d65cd21d2fac1f66</url></web-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>The complexities of multi-level advocacy within the EU create a number of challenges and opportunities for research.

At policy implementation, groups attempt to secure benefits or ameliorate legislated effects by devising cooperative or conflictual strategies to influence outcomes, especially when agency officials have discretion to design rules and negotiate agreements. Investigating group &quot; street-level&quot; activity with respect to the Endangered Species Act, this research finds that policy context and resources shape the degree of information and access available to groups, which influences the strategies groups adopt. Groups with access and specialized information will attempt to change or influence policy outcomes cooperatively.

It proposes a management approach that treats this phenomenon as a form of corporate political activity through which companies try to gain access to decision makers. By using sequence analysis to examine the career paths of almost 300 EU affairs managers based in public and private companies across 26 countries, three different ideal-typical managers are identified: those EU affairs managers coming from EU institutions and public affairs; those who make a career through the private sector; and those who establish themselves in national political institutions. This identification confirms that EU institutions need different types of information and companies need EU affairs managers with different professional backgrounds able to provide it. Rather than observing a revolving door of EU officials into EU government affairs, what the authors term ‘sliding doors’ – namely the separation of careers, especially between the public and private sectors – is discerned.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, C</author><author>Liang, W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Guanxi with government officials and organizational performance: The mediating role of lobbying</title><secondary-title>Energy Education Science and Technology Part A: Energy Science and Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy Education Science and Technology Part A: Energy Science and Research</full-title></periodical><pages>5731-5734</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>competition</keyword><keyword>competition environments</keyword><keyword>government officials</keyword><keyword>social aspects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Sila Science</publisher><notes>cited By 0

This article investigates which party groups in the EP are prioritized by EU lobbyists and why. The focus is on two presumed key components of this prioritization process, namely power and position. It is expected that lobbyists take into account both the extent to which parties align with their views and their legislative power. The empirical analysis draws on interviews with 143 interest group officials and their lobbying expenditures on 78 legislative proposals initiated by the European Commission between 2008 and 2010. The analysis suggests that the media prominence of party groups in relation to specific issues as well as the extent to which interest organizations and party groups adopt opposing policy positions considerably shape how party groups in the EP are targeted by lobbyists. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Palmer, Maxwell</author><author>Schneer, Benjamin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Postpolitical careers: How politicians capitalize on public office</title><secondary-title>Journal of Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>670-675</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>University of Chicago Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/701762</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://PALMER SCHNEER Post Political Careers 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061669887&amp;doi=10.1086%2F701762&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c083eecafe5d54f2d4bd6ea10d46755f</url></web-urls></urls><label>US;revolving doors</label><abstract>Former government officials have many different opportunities to cash in on their public service, but most academic research and government ethics regulations focus on lobbying. We argue that this focus understates the extent and diversity of employment opportunities available to former officials. Using a new data set of officeholders in American government (members of Congress, governors, members of the cabinet, executive branch officials, and ambassadors), we show that, with the exception of members of the House, former officials are more likely to join boards of public companies than they are to work as registered lobbyists. Furthermore, former officials join boards more quickly and face fewer ethics regulations compared to lobbyists. Increasing restrictions on lobbying also appears to push former officials toward alternative employment such as board service. Our findings demonstrate the breadth of the labor market for former politicians and suggest fruitful new avenues for research on political careers.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Newmark, Adam J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying regulation in the states revisited: What are we trying to measure, and how do we measure it?</title><secondary-title>Interest Groups and Advocacy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Interest Groups and Advocacy</full-title></periodical><pages>215-230</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Interest groups</keyword><keyword>lobbying regulation in the US states</keyword><keyword>lobbyists</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1057/s41309-017-0023-z</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 11

These laws are designed to provide accountability and to alter certain political behaviors. For decades, scholars have studied these laws, while a number of good government groups have created their own measures assessing lobby regulations. The result is a multitude of measures that often assess very different constructs. This article creates an updated measure of lobbying regulation and compares this measure to previous and current, alternative measures.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schuler, Douglas A.</author><author>Rehbein, Kathleen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determinants of access to legislative and executive branch officials: Business firms and trade policymaking in the U.S.</title><secondary-title>Business and Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Business and Politics</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>access</keyword><keyword>campaign contributions</keyword><keyword>corporate political activity</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>political markets</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2202/1469-3569.1340</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 9</notes><research-notes>cited By 9</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80755130306&amp;doi=10.2202%2F1469-3569.1340&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=90047a2aa65b2514e76ddb6d61f208b7</url></web-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>We examine the characteristics of business firms that gain access to legislative and executive branch officials in the trade policymaking area. Our empirical analysis of over 1200 manufacturers reveals that legislators were most attracted to firms with foreign market expertise, firms which actively participated in politics with outside lobbyists and campaign contributions, and firms with significant employment in the state and/or district. Executive branch officials were responsive to firms with foreign market expertise, firms from industries that had previously received tariff protection, firms using in-house government affairs specialists and outside lobbyists to convey information, and firms making campaign contributions to members of the trade oversight legislative committees. Our results largely support the political market framework and provide insights about the attractiveness of certain demanders to suppliers of trade policies from the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. federal government. © 2011 Berkeley Electronic Press.

While there is an established literature on the politicization of top public officials, we lack research on the politicization and/or de-facto independence of supreme or supervisory bodies, including ombuds institutions. In this paper, we combine the insights of three bodies of literature in order to build a framework for the empirical study of national ombuds institutions: Literature (1) on the independence of public institutions, in particular ombuds and regulatory agencies, (2) on politicization and party patronage in state institutions, and (3) on career patterns and selection criteria of top public officials and the administrative elite. We then discuss these issues on the basis of an empirical field study of the Austrian ombuds institution: First, drawing on a socio-demographic analysis of ombudspersons we identify common features of their profiles and career paths. We find that overall the ombudspersons represent a relatively homogenous group, but the political party represents an explanatory variable for some of the ombudspersons' characteristics. The second set of empirical results, drawing primarily on qualitative interviews with case-handling staff, demonstrates that despite the institution's public efforts and many interviewees' reassurances that the AOB is independent and acts as such, there are several areas in which party-related positions become visible in the AOB's work. These results are integrated into a typology on the effects of political appointment modes of ombudspersons, which should enable further research in this field.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bucur, Cristina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cabinet payoffs in coalition governments: A time-varying measure of portfolio importance</title><secondary-title>Party Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Party Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>154-167</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Gamson’s Law</keyword><keyword>cabinet rankings</keyword><keyword>coalitions</keyword><keyword>portfolio allocation</keyword><keyword>portfolio importance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>SAGE Publications Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1354068816644789</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 11</notes><research-notes>cited By 11</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BUCUR Cabinet Payoffs 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028852903&amp;doi=10.1177%2F1354068816644789&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6d1aa1f3a4ea7072fcb6a060dccda650</url></web-urls></urls><label>France;cabinet</label><abstract>Understanding how coalition parties in multiparty governments divide office and policy payoffs is one of the greatest challenges in political science. Gamson’s Law predicts that ministries are allocated proportionally with the coalition members’ legislative seat holding. However, doubts remain about how differences in the valuation of portfolios affect their distribution. The challenge is not only to determine whether government parties receive their fair share of cabinet payoffs once the importance of individual ministerial posts is taken into consideration, but also to develop a measure of portfolio importance that takes time and context into account. This article proposes a new method of measuring portfolio salience using official records of cabinet appointments in the Fifth French Republic that list ministerial posts hierarchically. The result is a more nuanced measure of portfolio importance, which is context sensitive and varies with time. The article argues that the new measure is able to reduce artificial deviations from the one-to-one linkage of seat shares and portfolio shares and that it can travel beyond the French case.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amado, Rivka</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Checks, balances, and appointments in the public service: Israeli experience in comparative perspective</title><secondary-title>Public Administration Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Administration Review</full-title></periodical><pages>569-584</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/0033-3352.00128</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 8</notes><research-notes>cited By 8</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Amado - 2001 - Checks, balances, and appointments in the public service Israeli experience in comparative perspective.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038970354&amp;doi=10.1111%2F0033-3352.00128&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=939fb45c151fe6696ad9da82b5af54ab</url></web-urls></urls><label>Israel;political appointments</label><abstract>This article explores the process of appointing government ministers and senior executive officials in Israel. It provides several case studies of the appointment process in the 1990s, a period of hyperfragmentation in the Israeli parliament. These studies reveal evidence of gross irresponsibility in the appointment process, as well as a lack of a meaningful oversight and checks in the process. One consequence is that the Israeli High Court was asked to intervene and review and reject a number of these appointments. The article argues that although well meaning, this intervention represents a dangerous new trend; this new role for the Courts is both inappropriate and counterproductive. It is inappropriate because judicial intervention imposes a legal solution when a political solution is called for, and it is counterproductive because frequent judicial intervention weakens both the judiciary and the political process. The article concludes with a proposal for an alternative approach to cope with the lack of meaningful oversight in the political-appointment process.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olavarría-Gambi, Mauricio</author><author>Dockendorff, Andrés</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Implementing Meritocracy in Senior Public Administration: the Dilemma for Chilean Politicians</title><secondary-title>Public Organization Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Organization Review</full-title></periodical><pages>561-582</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Chile</keyword><keyword>administrative reform</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>meritocracy</keyword><keyword>public administration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Springer New York LLC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11115-016-0360-4</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 7</notes><research-notes>cited By 7</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://OLAVARRÍA-GAMBI DOCKENDORFF Implementing Meritocracy in Senior Public Administration 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983335546&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs11115-016-0360-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=03edbd6ee549339c91802a2f66e6e0d4</url></web-urls></urls><label>Chile;how to measure professionalization</label><abstract>This article addresses the question of whether politicians are willing to overcome patronage by creating a merit-based recruitment and selection system of the senior civil servants with the purpose of making public administration more effective.

The most important indirect channel of influence for governments thus consists in appointing 'responsive' central bank officials and removing 'hostile' ones. This premise is tested by examining the effect of partisan ties between central bank governors and governments or presidents in 30 European democracies between 1945 and 2012. Drawing on an original dataset containing information on the party affiliations of 195 governors, event history models are employed to show that affiliation with a party represented in the executive (the government or the presidency) has a large and significant positive effect on governor survival. However, affiliation with an opposition party only increases governors' hazards during the first four years of their term, suggesting that the impact of the party label may be overridden as more reliable information about a governor becomes available. © 2013 European Consortium for Political Research.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mulgan, Richard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulating the post-employment of public officials: Australian experience in an international context</title><secondary-title>Australian Journal of Public Administration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian Journal of Public Administration</full-title></periodical><pages>201-216</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Australian ministerial code</keyword><keyword>Australian public service</keyword><keyword>codes ofconduct</keyword><keyword>conflict of interest</keyword><keyword>post-employment</keyword><keyword>public sectorethics</keyword><keyword>revolving door</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1467-8500.12466</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MULGAN Regulating the post-employment of public officials Australia 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101288880&amp;doi=10.1111%2F1467-8500.12466&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=40a50c8a53f398ee47ff18923fa9badd</url></web-urls></urls><label>Australia;revolving doors</label><abstract>The potential abuse of power by public officials after they have left government employment became a major issue in Australia with the appointment of two recently retired senior federal ministers to lucrative positions with firms which had close dealings with their former departments. The cases raise important questions about the regulation of ‘the revolving door’ which is an increasing feature of governance as the public and private sectors move more closely together. Australian Commonwealth rules relating to both ministers and public servants are analysed in the context of international practice and as part of the wider issue of conflict of interest. Four types of conflict are relevant to post-employment: ingratiation, profiteering, influence, and switching sides. The regulation of each type is discussed and Australian practice seen to be deficient in certain respects, particularly in relation to ministers. Regulation in this area faces two general challenges: definition of the offence and the comparative absence of oversight and sanctions. But international exemplars offer prospects for strengthening Australia's ethical regime.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Lei</author><author>Tang, Lixu</author><author>Liu, Rui</author><author>Li, Mingyue</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The career characteristics of China’s prefectural environmental protection bureau heads with implication for the environmental governance</title><secondary-title>Journal of Chinese Governance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Chinese Governance</full-title></periodical><pages>212-235</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>career path</keyword><keyword>environmental governance</keyword><keyword>environmental protection bureau head</keyword><keyword>leader characteristics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Taylor and Francis Ltd.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/23812346.2021.1943948</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LIU ET AL The career characteristics of China s prefectural environmental protection bureau 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109330604&amp;doi=10.1080%2F23812346.2021.1943948&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=39c1003303d17e649e539bbcc177ef87</url></web-urls></urls><label>China</label><abstract>As the direct responsible cadre in China’s local environmental management, the role of environmental protection bureau head (EPBH) is both critical and embarrassing. However, the profile of this group of cadres is largely unknown. This paper makes the first attempt to delineate China’s prefectural EPBHs and find several distinct features. First, although advocated by the central authority, “be younger” has not been realized in the appointment of EPBH. On the contrary, older candidates have been more favored in recent years. Second, EPBH is primarily a political actor rather than professional actor. However, they have been bearing increasing political pressure due to professional task. Third, county governments and other prefectural departments are the most important sources of EPBH, while for general environmental officials, it is very hard to be promoted as EPBH. Fourth, the promotion chance of EPBH is relatively high and most of them have been promoted to county governments and other prefectural departments. Last, the number of EPBHs removed because of dereliction has increased notably, but only a small fraction was sanctioned for poor and fraud environmental supervision. Finally, corresponding suggestions are proposed to optimize the selection, appointment, and management of EPBH.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Snyder, Susan K.</author><author>Weingast, Barry R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The American system of shared powers: The president, congress, and the NLRB</title><secondary-title>Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization</full-title></periodical><pages>269-305</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jleo/16.2.269</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 76</notes><research-notes>cited By 76</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SNYDER WEINGAST American System of Shared Powers 2000.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034357281&amp;doi=10.1093%2Fjleo%2F16.2.269&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7809b713b54819315d019c597829f192</url></web-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>The purpose of this article is to develop and test a model of political influence on regulation that incorporates both the competing interests of elected officials and the relevant institutional constraints. To do this, we focus on one channel of political influence: the appointment of agency leaders to a multimember regulatory board. The model has two stages: first, a bargaining stage between the president and Senate in which they choose a target policy; and second, the appointments stage in which they attempt to implement this target by choosing the median board member. The model's empirical leverage arises because elected officials can replace board members only when seats on the board become available through term expiration or resignation. This yields specific predictions about how and whether each appointment will change policy. We apply the model to the NLRB. The empirical results, investigating all appointments to the NLRB from 1949 until 1988, fit our theory remarkably well.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harris, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stalin as general secretary: The appointments process and the nature of Stalin’s power</title><secondary-title>Stalin: A New History</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Stalin: A New History</full-title></periodical><pages>63-82</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><isbn>9780511614897; 0521851041; 9780521851046</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/CBO9780511614897.007</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 10

The scores of political biographies and general histories covering the Stalin era suggest a variety of possibilities, from the use of terror and propaganda to the appeal of his policies, but almost without exception they mention Stalin's position as General Secretary. The common story suggests that, as General Secretary, Stalin used his control over appointments to build a personal following in the Party apparatus. The mechanics of this process are sometimes referred to as ‘a circular flow of power’. Stalin appointed individual Party secretaries and gave them security of tenure. In return, they voted for him at Party Congresses. It is generally taken as given that Stalin used the power this afforded him to remove his political rivals in the course of his rise to power, and in later years, to remove those officials who had reservations about his policies. In short, Stalin's power over appointment is commonly understood not only as a key factor in his rise to power, but also as the origin of his personalistic dictatorship. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, ‘revisionist’ scholars began to cast doubt on the idea that Stalin could be sure of the personal loyalty of Party officials and that they would unquestioningly execute his will. Since the opening of the archives, a substantial body of new evidence has reinforced their views.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pardow, Diego</author><author>Verdugo, Sergio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stability, professionalism and Politicization in the appointment of the heads of independent regulatory Agencies: Lessons from the chilean experience [Estabilidad, profesionalismo y politización en los nombramientos de directivos de agencias reguladoras i</title><secondary-title>Revista Derecho del Estado</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Revista Derecho del Estado</full-title></periodical><pages>223-252</pages><issue>46</issue><keywords><keyword>check and balances</keyword><keyword>formal independence</keyword><keyword>institutional design</keyword><keyword>parliament control</keyword><keyword>regulatory agencies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Universidad Externado de Colombia</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.18601/01229893.N46.09</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://PARDOW VERDUGO Estabilidad profesionalismo nombramientos 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086831044&amp;doi=10.18601%2F01229893.N46.09&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7fa06248a8e8291e3bdc40a1eb43ff22</url></web-urls></urls><label>Chile;how to measure politicisation;political appointments</label><abstract>The authors compare the appointments of the heads of regulatory agencies made with the participation of the Senate with those made either discretionally by the President, or through the system of High Public Directorship, i.e., an appointing procedure that seeks to reconcile the need to stimulate appointments of candidates with strong technical credentials, with the political interests of the incumbent government. The analysis of near 200 appointments made in Chile between 1990 and 2016, shows that the heads of regulatory agencies chosen with the involvement of the Senate have similar levels of political affiliation, but better overall professional credentials compared to the results achieved by other institutional models. Our evidence also suggests that the tenure of those officers is two times longer, and it is three times more likely that they remain in office after the installation of a new government. The article provides useful evidence to advance the discussion about the impact of the institutional appointing models on the autonomy of those institutions.

Some of them commenced their independence with a little more experience in governing than others. However, they all inherited the governing culture of their former colonial powers with limited prior experience in the relationship between government and administration that is required to obtain an efficient and effective public sector. Since independence, each country had to craft its own system of “democracy” but often succeeded only in establishing a semblance of democracy. The newly created democracies were characterized by volatility in communities endeavouring to maintain their identities and appointed officials failing to implement policies due to political involvement/interference. This chapter attends to the political/administrative interface as a debilitating factor in constitutional efforts to provide a stable state with the capacity to satisfy societal needs. Public sector institutions are characterised by the need for cooperation by two sets of role players. On the one side the elected political office bearers determine policy, set priorities according to their convictions and have to satisfy the electorate that their needs are being addressed. The other set of role players in the policy domain consists of appointed officials who have to give effect to policy (which may only contain vague guidelines) and ensure that the correct procedures are followed, that expenditure can be accounted for and that the promised services are delivered effectively and efficiently as viewed from society’s perspective. This results in an interface between politics and administration. However, there is no clearly delineated dividing line between the two functions, making the identification of the respective contributions by the two sets of participants complicated. The two functions may even be considered as complementary. This chapter discusses the interface from an African local government perspective. It is argued that the interface is diffused as a result of political involvement and interference of politicians in managerial matters, e.g. through the utilization of deployees (appointments based on political affiliation) or through the interference of higher levels of government in municipal matters. The arguments concerning the topic mainly use published and electronic sources. .</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schneider, Ben Ross</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Why is Mexican business so organized?</title><secondary-title>Latin American Research Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Latin American Research Review</full-title></periodical><pages>77-118</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><publisher>University of Texas Press</publisher><notes>cited By 49</notes><research-notes>cited By 49</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SCHNEIDER Mexican Business 2002.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2442417587&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7b76b4ffcdff9db374a368ef8784c075</url></web-urls></urls><label>Mexico</label><abstract>In the twentieth century, big business in Mexico invested much more in voluntary encompassing associations than business did elsewhere in Latin America. Multisectoral associations like the CCE, the CMNH, Coparmex, and COECE are rare in the other large countries of the region. Three primary factors gave Mexican business stronger incentives to invest in these associations. First, Mexican business was excluded from elections, PRI politics, and appointments to top government positions and therefore relied more on associations to channel business's organized participation in politics and policy making. Second, in some periods, government actions were threatening to business interests and prompted defensive organization. Third, in other periods of closer cooperation between business and government, government officials relied heavily on these associations to mediate relations with business, giving big business further incentives to invest in associations.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luechinger, Simon</author><author>Moser, Christoph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The value of the revolving door: Political appointees and the stock market</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Economics</full-title></periodical><pages>93-107</pages><volume>119</volume><keywords><keyword>conflicts of interest</keyword><keyword>event study</keyword><keyword>political appointees</keyword><keyword>revolving door</keyword><keyword>stock market</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.08.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 38</notes><research-notes>cited By 38</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LUECHINGER MOSER The value of the revolving door 2014.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908661364&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.jpubeco.2014.08.001&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e2f46ee8f6e8cf42e29093cb4e3964a6</url></web-urls></urls><label>US;political appointments;revolving doors</label><abstract>We analyze stock market reactions to announcements of political appointments from the private sector and corporate appointments of former government officials. Using unique data on corporate affiliations and announcements of all Senate-confirmed U.S. Defense Department appointees of six administrations, we find positive abnormal returns for political appointments. These estimates are not driven by important observations, volatile stocks, industry-wide developments or the omission of further commonly used return predictors. Placebo events for close competitors and alternative dates yield no effects. Effects are larger for top government positions and less anticipated announcements. We also find positive abnormal returns for corporate appointments and positive effects of political connections on procurement volume. Our results suggest that concerns over conflicts of interest created by the revolving door seem justified, even in a country with strong institutions.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kostka, Genia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Environmental Protection Bureau Leadership at the Provincial Level in China: Examining Diverging Career Backgrounds and Appointment Patterns</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental Policy and Planning</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental Policy and Planning</full-title></periodical><pages>41-63</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>agency</keyword><keyword>environmental protection</keyword><keyword>leadership</keyword><keyword>networks</keyword><keyword>policy implementation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/1523908X.2012.752184</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 20</notes><research-notes>cited By 20</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://KOSTKA Career Background China 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874131045&amp;doi=10.1080%2F1523908X.2012.752184&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dc569502b105da013ba8a8c81ef16e13</url></web-urls></urls><label>Chna</label><abstract>This paper analyses the career backgrounds of local government officials in provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs) in China and explains the appointment patterns of Chinese EPB bureaucrats. Using biographical information of provincial EPB heads and drawing on fieldwork conducted in Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia, this paper finds that only one-fourth of the provincial EPB heads were promoted through the bureau ranks within the EPBs, while the remaining three-fourths were appointed from positions outside the environment field. Further, nearly all EPB heads' professional backgrounds and associated networks can be clearly categorized as environmental, business, provincial government, or local government oriented. This paper delineates these four types of Chinese EPB leaders and explains why an awareness of the different professional orientations is critical to understanding environmental regulation and protection in China. These findings have implications for inferring the unique characteristics of a province's EPB leadership, the implementation capacities of provincial EPBs, and the appointment preferences of provincial leaders.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fitzgerald, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From county magistrate to county head: The role and selection of senior county officials in Guangdong province in the transition from empire to republic</title><secondary-title>Twentieth-Century China</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Twentieth-Century China</full-title></periodical><pages>254-279</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Guangdong Province</keyword><keyword>county</keyword><keyword>government</keyword><keyword>personnel selection</keyword><keyword>social elites</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Maney Publishing</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1179/1521538513Z.00000000030</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1

Continuity in the territorial architecture of state from empire to republic invites the question of whether provinces and counties were institutionally identical before and after the revolution. This paper explores adjustments made to the county level of government aimed at meeting republican ideals of good government and popular sovereignty. It probes changes in the roles assigned to county heads and the patterns of their appointment in Guangdong relating to educational qualifications, native places, and tenure over the transitional period. Employing magistrate tenure as a proxy for the stability of local government, the paper correlates variations in the length of tenure with other variables at the provincial and sub-provincial levels of government, including competition between different echelon levels, disputes between military and civil authorities, in-fighting among regime factions, and methods of appointment varying over time from appointment by administrative fiat to county-head elections. By relating these variables to longitudinal data on magistrates' length of tenure, it identifies some of the challenges facing provincial and county authorities in trying to manage the revolutionary transition from empire to republic at the local level while keeping the inherited territorial system largely intact.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyer-Sahling, Jan-Hinrik</author><author>Toth, Fany</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Governing illiberal democracies: Democratic backsliding and the political appointment of top officials in Hungary</title><secondary-title>NISPAcee Journal of Public Administration and Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NISPAcee Journal of Public Administration and Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>93-113</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Hungary</keyword><keyword>democratic backsliding</keyword><keyword>political appointments</keyword><keyword>politicisation</keyword><keyword>top officials</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Sciendo</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2478/nispa-2020-0016</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MEYER-SAHLING TOTH Political Appointment of Top Officials in Hungary 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098655783&amp;doi=10.2478%2Fnispa-2020-0016&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=856a832860c359d4c1feb7b2788473d6</url></web-urls></urls><label>Hungary</label><abstract>This paper examines the impact of democratic backsliding on the management of top officials in Hungary. Based on a unique data set of more than 1,600 top officials the article shows that the number of appointments to top positions increased in 2010 and subsequent years, during which Hungary experienced democratic backsliding. Moreover, the data shows that turnover in top official positions was higher in 2010 and in subsequent years than in the period between 1990 and 2010. The paper concludes that the politicisation and high degree of instability in top official positions may be characteristic of governance in illiberal democracies. © 2020 Jan-Hinrik Meyer-Sahling, Fanni Toth, published by Sciendo.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reuter, O J</author><author>Robertson, G B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subnational appointments in authoritarian regimes: Evidence from russian gubernatorial appointments</title><secondary-title>Journal of Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>1023-1037</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0022381612000631</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 162</notes><research-notes>cited By 162</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://REUTER ROBERTSON Subnational Appointments Russia 2012.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867693706&amp;doi=10.1017%2FS0022381612000631&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=752685c0cb9522caed026aab8dd65caf</url></web-urls></urls><label>Russia;political appointments</label><abstract>Elections are among the most important and least understood institutions in contemporary authoritarian regimes. Theoretically, electoral authoritarian regimes should have an informational advantage that makes them more robust than other types of authoritarian regimes, but much empirical evidence suggests otherwise. In this article we offer a new perspective on why this might be the case. Specifically, we consider how authoritarian elections influence a ruler's choices in making cadre appointments. We argue that the imperative of winning authoritarian elections forces authoritarian leaders to prioritize the appointment of politically loyal cadres, who can help the regime win elections. This choice often comes at the expense of appointing officials who are competent at making good public policy and promoting economic development, factors that may contribute to long-term regime stability. We test this theory using an original dataset of gubernatorial appointments in one leading contemporary authoritarian regime, Russia.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Graham, Nicolas</author><author>Carroll, William K</author><author>Chen, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carbon Capital's Political Reach: A Network Analysis Of Federal Lobbying By The Fossil Fuel Industry From Harper To Trudeau</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>1-31</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>corporate power</keyword><keyword>fossil capitalism</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>network analysis</keyword><keyword>state</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>BRITISH COLUMBIA POLITICAL STUDIES ASSOC, BURNABY, BC 00000, CANADA</pub-location><publisher>BRITISH COLUMBIA POLITICAL STUDIES ASSOC</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GRAHAM ET AL A Network Analysis Of Federal Lobbying Canada 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Canada</label><abstract>This paper provides a network analysis of federal lobbying in Canada by the fossil fuel industry and compares lobbying across the Harper Conservative and Trudeau Liberal administrations. The network we uncover amounts to a small world of intense interaction among relatively few lobbyists/firms and public officials in select centres of state power. Under Trudeau we find that the majority of lobbying is carried out by the same large firms as under Harper, while lobbying has become trained on fewer state agencies.

Using the Advocacy Coalition Framework, this article analyzes the agenda setting and strategies of different coalitions, analyzing a broad array of news, interviews, laws, and official documents between 2001 and 2012. Two coalitions were identified: one in favor of changes in legislation, comprised of sectors of the Executive, legislative, the media and civil society; and another in favor of the maintenance of restrictive rules of access to information, composed of Armed Forces, Itamaraty (Brazil's diplomatic corps) and the Senate's Legislative Commission on Defense and Foreign Affairs. The article also identifies an overlap of two public policy subsystems: the transparency subsystem and the reconciliation one. The latter monopolized the public debate on the subject, contributing to the slowness in approving a transparency law. Itamaraty also emerges as the author of a strong lobby against changes in the rules for document classification, for reasons yet to be studied.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mejia, Raul</author><author>Schoj, Verónica</author><author>Barnoya, Joaquin</author><author>Flores, Maria Laura</author><author>Pérez-Stable, Eliseo J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tobacco industry strategies to obstruct the FCTC in Argentina</title><secondary-title>CVD Prevention and Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CVD Prevention and Control</full-title></periodical><pages>173-179</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Argentina</keyword><keyword>FCTC</keyword><keyword>tobacco control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cvdpc.2008.09.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 22</notes><research-notes>cited By 22</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MEJIA ET AL Tobacco Industry Strategies 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57049180749&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.cvdpc.2008.09.002&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bbaf484f63417ae7bbe04650e1d6546a</url></web-urls></urls><label>Argentina</label><abstract>Objective: To describe the strategies pursued by the tobacco industry (TI) to interfere with the ratification of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in Argentina. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews about the FCTC, the TI and the legislative process with 3 legislators, 4 public health officials, 1 representative of the tobacco growers and two tobacco control advocates. We reviewed 6 newspapers from the 4 tobacco growing provinces, searched TI documents in the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and reviewed 1624 documents. Proposed legislation and related documents on tobacco control from Argentina's National Congress and the Provincial Jujuy Congress were reviewed. Results: The principal strategy used by the TI was lobbying of provincial legislators and federal officials from the Ministry of the Economy by the tobacco growers associations. These legislators prevented the passage of comprehensive bills on tobacco control or of less comprehensive national laws. A typical legislative strategy used was to request additional analyses of the proposed bills from committees that prioritized economic issues over health. FCTC was mentioned in regional newspapers three to seven times per week in articles about alleged adverse economic effects of tobacco control. Direct physical threats to legislators who were openly supportive of FCTC ratification were made. Conclusion: Tobacco producers and TI opposed FCTC ratification in Argentina by lobbying elected representatives and placing stories in regional media to obstruct approval of tobacco control laws. These activities have led to a delay in consideration of Argentina's ratification of the FCTC despite the President's signature in 2003. © 2008 World Heart Federation.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mialon, M</author><author>Gaitan Charry, D A</author><author>Cediel, G</author><author>Crosbie, E</author><author>Baeza Scagliusi, F</author><author>Pérez Tamayo, E M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>&quot;The architecture of the state was transformed in favour of the interests of companies&quot;: Corporate political activity of the food industry in Colombia</title><secondary-title>Globalization and Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Globalization and Health</full-title></periodical><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>commercial determinants of health</keyword><keyword>corporate political activity</keyword><keyword>food industry</keyword><keyword>non-communicable diseases</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12992-020-00631-x</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 7</notes><research-notes>cited By 7</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MIALON ET AL Food Industry Strategies Colombia 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092534307&amp;doi=10.1186%2Fs12992-020-00631-x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0161a4a45e1362c2dc0acdc5c013a83b</url></web-urls></urls><label>Colombia</label><abstract>Background: In Colombia, public health policies to improve food environments, including front-of-pack nutrition labelling and marketing restrictions for unhealthy products, are currently under development. Opposition to these policies by the food industry is currently delaying and weakening these efforts. This opposition is commonly known as 'corporate political activity' (CPA) and includes instrumental (action-based) strategies and discursive (argument-based) strategies. Our aim was to identify the CPA of the food industry in Colombia. Methods: We conducted a document analysis of information available in the public domain published between January-July 2019. We triangulated this data with interviews with 17 key informants. We used a deductive approach to data analysis, based on an existing framework for the CPA of the food industry. Results: We identified 275 occurrences of CPA through our analysis of publicly available information. There were 197 examples of instrumental strategies and 138 examples of discursive strategies (these categories are not mutually exclusive, 60 examples belong to both categories). Interview participants also shared information about the CPA in the country. The industry used its discursive strategies to portray the industry in a 'better light', demonstrating its efforts in improving food environments and its role in the economic development of the country. The food industry was involved in several community programmes, including through public private initiatives. The industry also captured the media and tried to influence the science on nutrition and non-communicable diseases. Food industry actors were highly prominent in the policy sphere, through their lobbying, close relationships with high ranking officials and their support for self-regulation in the country. Conclusions: The proximity between the industry, government and the media is particularly evident and remains largely unquestioned in Colombia. The influence of vulnerable populations in communities and feeling of insecurity by public health advocates is also worrisome. In Colombia, the CPA of the food industry has the potential to weaken and delay efforts to develop and implement public health policies that could improve the healthiness of food environments. It is urgent that mechanisms to prevent and manage the influence of the food industry are developed in the country.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boräng, Frida</author><author>Naurin, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>‘Try to see it my way!’ Frame congruence between lobbyists and European Commission officials</title><secondary-title>Journal of European Public Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of European Public Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>499-515</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>European Union</keyword><keyword>framing</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>media</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Routledge</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/13501763.2015.1008555</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 26</notes><research-notes>cited By 26</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BORANG NAURIN Lobbyists and Officials EU 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924238125&amp;doi=10.1080%2F13501763.2015.1008555&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a9190421c2cc15c247a08cc89a283899</url></web-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>ABSTRACT: We study how frame congruence – the degree to which key policy-makers’ frames correspond to the frames of lobbyists – is distributed between different types of interest groups. We argue that two contextual factors are particularly important for whether the frames of business interests dominate those of civil society interests in the minds of European Commission officials. First, the broader the scope of the conflict, i.e., the more affected interests active in the process, the more difficult it will be to promote narrow self-regarding frames, a fact that benefits civil society interests. Second, as business dominates the media coverage of European Union legislative proposals, the more publicity the proposals receive the higher the frame congruence of business lobbyists and Commission officials. Our empirical analysis is based on 144 face-to-face interviews with Commission officials and lobbyists in relation to 55 legislative proposals that were put forward by the Commission during 2008–10. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor &amp; Francis.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rittau, Yasmin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regional Labour Councils, Local Employment Generation and Labour-Community Coalitions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Industrial Relations</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Industrial Relations</full-title></periodical><pages>395-400</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1472-9296.00090</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://RITTAU Regional Labour Councils 2003.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992850812&amp;doi=10.1111%2F1472-9296.00090&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f3a92d5d0d56d81bd959406b91acf1d8</url></web-urls></urls><label>Australia</label><abstract>Regional labour councils have been involved in building labour-community coalitions. The case study of the South Coast Labour Council demonstrates that a regional labour council can engage in a broader make-up of lobbying partners than is generally recognised in the literature, which includes labour-community coalitions that are not geographically, politically or socially close. The South Coast Labour Council did not focus on employer opposition, as is usually the case with building labour-community coalitions, but rather, it focused on lobbying farmers to increase pressure on government officials for the siting of a grain terminal in Port Kembla, near Wollongong in the Illawarra region of NSW. It pursued broader aims of labour-community coalitions to include local employment generation.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mialon, Melissa</author><author>Cediel, Gustavo</author><author>Jaime, Patrícia Constante</author><author>Scagliusi, Fernanda Baeza</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>&quot;A consistent stakeholder management process can guarantee the 'social license to operate'&quot;: Mapping the political strategies of the food industry in Brazil</title><secondary-title>Cadernos de Saude Publica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cadernos de Saude Publica</full-title></periodical><volume>37</volume><keywords><keyword>food industry</keyword><keyword>professional ethics</keyword><keyword>public policy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/0102-311X00085220</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MIALON ET AL Food Industry Strategies Brazil 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125156087&amp;doi=10.1590%2F0102-311X00085220&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bf09d6935801be26e222dfcdceee1b22</url></web-urls></urls><label>Brazil</label><abstract>In the past, food industry actors tried to delay and weaken public health efforts to promote adequate and healthy diets in Brazil. This study aimed to identify the political strategies used by food industry actors in Brazil. We undertook a document analysis of publicly available information and interviews with eighteen key informants in public health nutrition. Data collection and analysis were carried between October 2018 and January 2019. In Brazil, food industry actors interacted with health organizations, communities, and the media. They disseminated information on nutrition and physical activity by scientific events and schools. The food industry also had allies within the government and lobbied high ranking officials. Finally, food industry actors intimidated some public health professionals, including by threats of litigation, which had the effect of silencing them. These strategies were facilitated by the use of arguments, such as the crucial role that the food industry plays in the economy and its support to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Personal responsibility, moderation, and education were cited as solutions to the obesity epidemic, and there was little discussion on the broader issue of inadequate and unhealthy diets. Food industry actors in Brazil used a diverse range of political strategies, which have the potential of negatively influencing public policy, research, and practice in the country. Learning about these strategies is an essential first step, and in response, it is crucial to develop robust mechanisms to address undue influence from corporations.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arroyo, Jennifer Isabel</author><author>Jiménez Cascante, Leonardo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Economic interest groups and conflicts of interest in the Costa Rican law [Grupos de interés económico y conflictos de interés en la legislación costarricense]</title><secondary-title>Revista de Derecho Privado</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Revista de Derecho Privado</full-title></periodical><pages>1-39</pages><issue>53</issue><keywords><keyword>conflict of interest</keyword><keyword>economic interest groups</keyword><keyword>public ethics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Universidad Externado de Colombia</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.15425/redepriv.53.2015.09</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ARROYO JIMENEZ Grupos de interés económico y conflictos de interés 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84951985586&amp;doi=10.15425%2Fredepriv.53.2015.09&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5a175587e883fa3e66e03fc1cdccd899</url></web-urls></urls><label>Costa Rica</label><abstract>In this research we tried to analyze the power of influence of economic interest groups since a different perspective, longer than only economic impact.

The question stems from a principal-agent problem inherent in representative forms of government the possibility that government officials will not act in the public's best interests and it is rarely absent from legal and policy debates. Major regulatory failures and the government's responses to them have renewed its significance in recent years, as agencies implement new laws and adapt old ones, courts review their actions, and the White House and Congress debate proposals for regulatory reform. Traditional models of democratic legitimacy in administrative law focus on agency accountability to elected officials or increasing interest group participation in the regulatory process. These models are valuable but ultimately fall short, largely because their representative nature replicates rather than remedies the core principal-agent problem. More recently, some scholars and reformers have attempted to engage citizens directly in the regulatory process. But these efforts have not circumvented the representation-based problems, and they also suffer from the high costs and other complications of direct democracy that counsel in favor of representative forms of government. This Article introduces a new model for democratic legitimacy, ``direct republicanism,{''} which attempts to combine elements of representative and direct approaches. In a direct republican system, large panels of randomly selected citizens decide policy questions presented to them by government officials. In this way, citizens can act as their own representatives, the principals their own agents. The Article sketches an initial application of direct republicanism to the regulatory process in the form of ``administrative juries.{''}</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Troynina, Ekaterina Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolution of science and technology policy of Taiwan's government in the 1970-2000s: interest groups</title><secondary-title>VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY</full-title></periodical><pages>98-102</pages><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Taiwan</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>science and technology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA</pub-location><publisher>TOMSK STATE UNIV</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.17223/19988613/34/16</electronic-resource-num><notes>Not available: Requested through Research Gate</notes><research-notes>Not available: Requested through Research Gate</research-notes><urls/><label>Taiwan</label><abstract>Dynamic science and technology development of Taiwan since 1970-s was entailed by the number of internal and external factors, the main of them, however, was the government policy. Till 1987, while the state of emergency remained valid and under the conditions of authoritarian political regime of Kuomintang, it was Taiwanese technocrats who worked out science and technology policy. The technocrats being loyal to presidents Chiang Kai-Shek and Chiang Ching-Kuo, to some extent were under the ideological influence of the Western science schools, had extensive personal and business relations with the Western, mostly American, businessmen and officials. The technocrats faced little influence from local interest groups as the latter were weak and discrete. Taiwanese technocratic government set up a strong science and technology base, promoted the establishment of state-funded research institutes (ITRI, III) and Hsinchu Science Park, which became the basement for the rapid S\&amp;T development of Taiwan. Political and social changes started in the second half of 1980-s resulted in democratic transition, emergence of legal opposition in 1986 (Democratic Progressive Party) and the transformations of how political decisions were taken. Democratization of Kuomintang regime has led to complication of science and technology policy: on one hand, the competition between various governmental agencies has started, on the other hand, different interested groups gained enough power to put pressure on the government. Taking biotechnology as an example, in 2000-s, under the democratic conditions Taiwan's S\&amp;T policy has been a compromise of the following political powers: 1) executive agencies (National Science Council, Council of Agriculture, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Academia Sinica, etc.); 2) political parties (green coalition under DPP, blue coalition under Kuomintang); 3) business groups: small and medium-sized enterprises as they are the most wide business layer, 4) academics, scientists and experts. Each power strives for promotion of its interests, allocation of resources and subsidies, carries out independent researches in its own realm. The power of the technocrats has eroded in the 2000-s, and this term is now seldom used to describe politicians in Taiwan. Although democratic transition has undermined the power of technocrats who created science and technology system of Taiwan in 1970-1990-s, by the 2000 the private sector has become mature enough to sustain S\&amp;T development. The quantitative S\&amp;T indicators show that Taiwan S\&amp;T system remained its growth pace and become more private-funded and independent.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ping, Zhang</author><author>Zhiwen, Huang</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Guo, X</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Guanxi with Government Officials, Lobbying and Business Group Performance in Transition China: A Theoretical Framework</title><secondary-title>International Conference on Economic and Information Management (ICEIM 2011), Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Conference on Economic and Information Management (ICEIM 2011), Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA</full-title></periodical><pages>74-77</pages><keywords><keyword>Bu</keyword><keyword>Corporate political activity</keyword><keyword>Guanxi</keyword><keyword>Lobbying</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>UNIT D, 16-F, CHEUK NANG PLAZA 250 HENNESSY RD, WANCHAI, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA</pub-location><publisher>SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY PRESS CO LTD</publisher><isbn>978-988-15121-2-3</isbn><notes>International Conference on Economic and Information Management (ICEIM

Various obstacles to the development of PSM among the different groups are found, and the means of encouraging PSM are discussed. However, it should be pointed out that the primary requirements for a government employee should be competence and a ``sense of responsibility{''} in carrying out the duties of the post concerned, while PSM serves only as an additional merit, indeed of secondary importance.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Solaiman, Barry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying in the UK: Towards Robust Regulation</title><secondary-title>PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS</full-title></periodical><volume>00</volume><keywords><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>legislation</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>register</keyword><keyword>transparency</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><pub-location>GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>OXFORD UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/pa/gsab051</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SOLAMAIN Lobbying in the UK 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>UK</label><abstract>This article argues that the transparency regime regulating the activities of lobbyists in the UK and the devolved administrations fails to address the core problems of political lobbying and should be replaced. This is particularly important following Brexit because the regulatory landscape will change significantly in the years to come. The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014 establishes a registry-based system of regulating lobbyists seeking to communicate with the government in Westminster. The Scotland (Lobbying) Act 2016 establishes a similar system, with calls for a lobbying register in Wales also growing. Analyses of existing laws reveal several flaws with those registry-based systems resulting in inadequate levels of transparency. To remedy the shortfall and to get transparency right, this article argues for two changes. First, a more robust register for professional lobbyists premised on greater transparency that is harmonised for Westminster and the devolved administrations. Secondly, the creation of a centralised public website acting as the official forum for advocacy tied to specific legislative proposals.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mialon, Melissa</author><author>Corvalan, Camila</author><author>Cediel, Gustavo</author><author>Scagliusi, Fernanda Baeza</author><author>Reyes, Marcela</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Food industry political practices in Chile: ``the economy has always been the main concern{''}</title><secondary-title>GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH</full-title></periodical><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>commercial determinants of health</keyword><keyword>corporate political activity</keyword><keyword>diseases</keyword><keyword>food industry</keyword><keyword>non-communicable</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>BMC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12992-020-00638-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MIALON ET AL Food Industry Strategies Chile 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Chile</label><abstract>Background In the business literature, the term ``corporate political activity{''} (CPA) refers to the political strategies undertaken by corporations to protect or expend their markets, by influencing, directly or indirectly, the policy process. There is evidence that food industry actors use such political practices, which poses a significant threat to public health. Our study objective was to identify the political practices of the food industry in Chile. Results In Chile, food industry actors supported community initiatives, particularly those targeted at children and those focused on environmental sustainability. Food industry actors also funded research through prizes, scholarships, and by supporting scientific events. Food industry actors lobbied against the development and implementation of a front-of-pack nutrition labelling policy, including with support from the Ministries of Economy, Agriculture and Foreign Affairs. Food industry actors, for example, claimed that there would be unintended negative consequences for society and the economy, and that the policy would breach trade agreements. The same arguments were used against a proposed tax increase on sugar-sweetened beverages. Food industry actors stressed their crucial role in the Chilean economy and claimed to be part of the solution in the prevention and control of obesity, with a particular focus on their efforts to reformulate food products, and their support of physical activity initiatives. Interviewees noted that the political influence of the food industry is often facilitated by the neo-liberal and market-driven economy of Chile. Nevertheless, this system was questioned through social protests that started in the country during data collection. Conclusions In Chile, food industry actors used numerous action- and argument-based CPA practices which may influence public health policy, research, and practice. Despite strong influence from the food industry, Chile adopted a front-of-pack nutrition labelling policy. While the country has some measures in place to manage the interactions between government officials or public health professionals, and the industry, there is still a need to develop robust mechanisms to address undue influence from corporations.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lashmar, Paul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From Silence to Primary Definer: The Emergence of an Intelligence Lobby in the Public Sphere</title><secondary-title>CRITICAL SOCIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CRITICAL SOCIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>411-430</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Five Eyes</keyword><keyword>GCHQ</keyword><keyword>MI5</keyword><keyword>MI6</keyword><keyword>SIS</keyword><keyword>intelligence lobby</keyword><keyword>public sphere</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA</pub-location><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0896920518780987</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LASHMAR Intelligence Lobby 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>UK</label><abstract>Until the end of the Cold War the UK intelligence services were not officially acknowledged, and their personnel were banned from entering the public sphere. From 1989 the UK government began to put the intelligence services on a legal footing and to release the identity of the heads of the intelligence agencies. Since then, public engagement by the intelligence agencies has gathered pace. What this article hypothesises is that there is now, in the UK, an effective intelligence lobby of former insiders who engage in the public sphere - using on the record briefings - to counter criticism of the intelligence community and to promote a narrative and vision of what UK intelligence should do, how it is supported and how oversight is conducted. Content analysis and framing models of non-broadcast coverage of intelligence debates, focusing on the 36 months after the Snowden revelations, confirm an active and rolling lobby of current and former intelligence officials. The paper concludes that the extent of the lobby's interventions in the public sphere is a matter for debate and possible concern.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kopecky, Petr</author><author>Meyer-Sahling, Jan-Hinrik</author><author>Spirova, Maria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>(Extreme) political polarization and party patronage</title><secondary-title>IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IRISH POLITICAL STUDIES</full-title></periodical><pages>218-243</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2, SI</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \&amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07907184.2022.2045143</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://KOPECKY SPINOVA Extreme political polarization and party patronage 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>patronage</label><abstract>The contemporary literature on political parties has identified their gradual but consistent shift away from civil society and towards the state. As parties are becoming ever increasingly dependent on state resources and exclusively interested in governing, as Mair (Ruling the void: The hollowing of western democracy {[}Verso Books, 2013]) suggested, and patronage is a fundamental to that relationship, the degree and modes of party patronage becomes pivotal to understanding their performance, and the ways they organize and govern. In this paper we argue that party patronage is likely to be structured by the nature of political competition and explore the effects of political polarization, which is a feature of political competition relatively independent from the precise format of a party system, on patronage practices. We advance a theoretical argument which systematically links different types of political polarization with different patterns of party patronage, arguing that extreme polarization incentivizes political parties to develop heavily partisan strategies of party patronage which, in turn, further fuel political polarization. Thus, we also contribute to burgeoning literature on political polarization and its negative effects on the functioning of both political parties and overall political systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wood, Abby K.</author><author>Lewis, David E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Agency Performance Challenges and Agency Politicization</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</full-title></periodical><pages>581-595</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>US</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>OXFORD UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jopart/mux014</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://WOOD LEWIS Agency Politicization 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>In this article we evaluate the relationship between political control and bureaucratic performance using information requested by researchers via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and Congress via congressional committee requests. The information requested was the same, and the timing of requests was similar. We find modest evidence of a relationship between agency politicization and a lack of responsiveness to requests for information from the public and Congress. Politicized agencies are slower to respond to requests even when controlling for agency size and workload. There is little evidence, however, that these agencies are more likely to respond poorly when they do respond. The difficulties in responding appear to be due to poor performance of the FOIA offices, either because political actors focus more on other agency activities or because of poorer management agency-wide. We conclude that efforts to make agencies responsive to elected officials may hurt management performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Edward Alan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bureaucratic policy making on trial: Medicaid nursing facility reimbursement, 1988-1998</title><secondary-title>Medical Care Research and Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical Care Research and Review</full-title></periodical><pages>189-216</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Medicaid</keyword><keyword>intergovernmental</keyword><keyword>litigation</keyword><keyword>nursing homes</keyword><keyword>policy making</keyword><keyword>states</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1077558705285297</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 13</notes><research-notes>cited By 13</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MILLER Bureaucratic Policy Making on Trial 2006.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33644798716&amp;doi=10.1177%2F1077558705285297&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3175350fbcdf76825ec98921380eed22</url></web-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Few systematically assess the determinants of Medicaid nursing facility reimbursement. Consequently, this article examines what factors influenceprogram administrators'decisions regarding nursing facility cost report data - the basic information states use to establish payment. Whereas elected officials focus primarily on how much is spent on nursing homes, state Medicaid officials assume primary responsibility for the esoteric and highly technical dimensions that help make spending goals a reality. Findings indicate that the federal government influenced state policy by enabling provider litigation under the Boren Amendment. They also indicate that program administrators responded rationally to fiscal and economic concerns, and that states with stronger administrative capacity were better able to overcome obstacles to sustaining desired policies. Although results reveal that states with more powerful nursing home lobbies tended to implement more generous systems, they fail to reveal significant associations between cost report year and lobbying activity on behalf of the elderly.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Albareda, Adrià</author><author>Braun, Caelesta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Organizing Transmission Belts: The Effect of Organizational Design on Interest Group Access to EU Policy-making</title><secondary-title>Journal of Common Market Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Common Market Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>468-485</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>EU administrative officials</keyword><keyword>EU political official</keyword><keyword>access</keyword><keyword>interest group</keyword><keyword>organizational design</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jcms.12831</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 16</notes><research-notes>cited By 16</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ALBAREDA BRAUN IG Access to EU Policy-making 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057426018&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fjcms.12831&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c7f38f4960f035ed07850c6e732f0180</url></web-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>The European Commission's outreach to interest groups implies that they function as ‘transmission belts’ that aggregate and articulate interests as policy-relevant information for policy-makers. Operating as a transmission belt, however, requires an organizational design fit for this purpose. We offer one of the first systematic analyses of how organizational design affects interest group access to public officials. We draw from a novel dataset of 248 EU-level interest groups including data on several dimensions of organizational design. One of our key findings is that qualified majority and consensus-facilitating decision-making procedures help interest groups gain access to administrative and political officials, whereas functional differentiation is important to get access to administrative officials, but not to political officials. Our findings thus demonstrate the relevance of organizational design in gaining access as well as the need to incorporate varying informational demands of public officials to properly explain interest group access to public decision-making.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Payson, Julia A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cities in the statehouse: How local governments use lobbyists to secure state funding</title><secondary-title>Journal of Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>403-417</pages><volume>82</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>University of Chicago Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/706767</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 9

Although intergovernmental lobbying is common in the United States and other federal systems, we know little about its consequences. Using newly compiled data on state-level lobbying across the country, I establish a positive correlation between city lobbying and state funding. I then introduce over a decade of panel data onmunicipal lobbying in California to estimate the returns to lobbying for cities with a difference-indifferences design. I show that lobbying increases state transfers to cities by around 8%. But the benefits of intergovernmental lobbying are not equally distributed. I find that cities with higher levels of own-source revenue per capita net more statemoney when they hire lobbyists, despite enjoying a local revenue advantage. These results offer some of the first empirical evidence that city officials can influence state spending by lobbying—but this behavior may also perpetuate local economic inequality. © 2020 by the Southern Political Science Association.

We attempt to further that agenda by exploring an aspect of group influence that has been little studied: the role interest groups play on the inside of government as official participants in bureaucratic decision-making. The challenges for research are formidable, but a fuller understanding of group influence in American politics requires that they be taken on. Here we carry out an exploratory analysis that focuses on the bureaucratic boards that govern public pensions. These are governance structures of enormous financial consequence for state governments, public workers, and taxpayers. They also make decisions that are quantitative (and comparable) in nature, and they usually grant official policymaking authority to a key interest group: public employees and their unions. Our analysis suggests that these &quot;interest groups on the inside&quot; do have influence - in ways that weaken effective government. Going forward, scholars should devote greater attention to how insider roles vary across agencies and groups, how groups exercise influence in these ways, how different governance structures shape their policy effects, and what it all means for our understanding of interest groups in American politics.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dempsey, Caroline P.</author><author>Milford, Jonathan L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presidential appointments: Overview and the 110th Congress</title><secondary-title>Presidential Appointments: Overview and the 110th Congress</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Presidential Appointments: Overview and the 110th Congress</full-title></periodical><pages>1-140</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Nova Science Publishers, Inc.</publisher><isbn>9781613240670</isbn><notes>cited By 0

Nevertheless, the historical experience of the development of the administrative state in the United States holds very different lessons. The U.S. case reveals that the construction of a strong administrative apparatus is an essentially political endeavour that arises out of inter-institutional conflict and an intense engagement between state and society.

It is argued that the logic of policy making has shifted from what can be described as 'the politics of expertise' to a process of 'politicisation'. A process of politicisation can be observed both in terms of the nature of arguments being used, and in terms of who the dominant actors are. The subjects of analysis are issues taken up by the political parties in the Parliament, and the paper focuses on two controversial questions. One is about the localisation of conservation areas on private land and the state's liability for compensation. The other is the question of whether the management of conservation areas, and in particular national parks, should be under the control of local government or the state environmental bureaucracy. The analysis documents a process moving in the direction of more complex governance structure involving more actors and broader local participation challenging the role of the professional bureaucracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laryea-Adjei, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Building capacity for urban management in Ghana: Some critical considerations</title><secondary-title>Habitat International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Habitat International</full-title></periodical><pages>391-401</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Ghana</keyword><keyword>capacity building</keyword><keyword>human resource development</keyword><keyword>local government</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0197-3975(00)00005-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ADJEI Urban management in Ghana 2000.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Ghana</label><abstract>Severe capacity gaps continue to constrain effective urban management in Ghana, despite numerous donor-supported training programmes. This paper examines the nature of these capacity gaps and analyses specifically the factors contributing to the low attraction and retention of local government staff: politicisation of the bureaucracy, excessive use of external experts, excessive state intervention in skill development and low remuneration of local government staff. Against this background, the paper reviews critically a recent capacity building initiative: the establishment of the (new) Institute of Local Government Studies in Accra. Suggestions to improve capacity building for urban management in Ghana are offered. These include the need to prepare a coherent strategy to guide and co-ordinate stakeholder inputs in capacity building; to place training in the context of institutional development; and encourage the development and use of local expertise in donor assisted projects; and, promote merit-based remuneration of local government staff.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bes, Bart Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Europe's executive in stormy weather: How does politicization affect commission officials' attitudes?</title><secondary-title>Comparative European Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Comparative European Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>533-556</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1057/s41295-016-0003-8</electronic-resource-num><notes>Text unavailable</notes><research-notes>Text unavailable</research-notes><urls/><label>EU;Netherlands</label><abstract>The politicization of the European Union has elicited a variety of views on the European polity.

How does politicization affect the institutional role conceptions of Commission officials? By building on the literature of politicization and norm-guided open system approaches, I develop theoretical propositions on how politicization may affect the institutional role conceptions of Commission officials. Grounded on the proposition that Commission officials are most likely to respond to politicization in their home country, an exploratory case study of Dutch officials (21 in-depth interviews) was performed to flesh out the mechanisms at play. The findings tentatively reveal that, in varying degrees, most officials respond to politicization by adapting their institutional role conception into a more pragmatic direction, in which subsidiarity or legitimacy concerns are central.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bersch, Katherine</author><author>Praça, Sérgio (UFABC)</author><author>Taylor, Matthew M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State Capacity, Bureaucratic Politicization, and Corruption in the Brazilian State</title><secondary-title>Governance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Governance</full-title></periodical><pages>105-124</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gove.12196</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://[Artigo] BERSCH ET AL State Capacities 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Brazil</label><abstract>Responding to recent articles in Governance highlighting the need for improved measurement of bureaucratic characteristics, this article describes efforts to map Brazil's federal agencies on three dimensions—capacity, autonomy, and partisan dominance—derived from data on more than 326,000 civil servants.

The need for organizational learning is high under such circumstances. Conventional theories, however, conceive political involvement as a constraint on organizational learning. This implies a paradoxical challenge for public organizations. On the one hand, the need to learn from mistakes is highest in times of political scrutiny; on the other hand, under such conditions learning is presumed to be most difficult. After studying the effects of politicization on organizational learning in detail, we come to the conclusion that this notion is incomplete at best. Learning in public organizations depends not so much on political involvement as such but, rather, on the specific characteristics of that involvement. Politicians may influence learning processes positively if they commit to structural solutions and encourage the institutionalization of organizational lessons.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hustedt, Thurid</author><author>Salomonsen, Heidi Houlberg</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ensuring political responsiveness: politicization mechanisms in ministerial bureaucracies</title><secondary-title>International Review of Administrative Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Review of Administrative Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>746-765</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0020852314533449</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HUSTEDT SALOMONSEN politicization mechanisms in ministerial bureaucracies 2014.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>comparative studies;definition of politicization</label><abstract>Although politicization is a perennial research topic in public administration to investigate relationships between ministers and civil servants, the concept still lacks clarification. This article contributes to this literature by systematically identifying different conceptualizations of politicization and suggests a typology including three politicization mechanisms to strengthen the political responsiveness of the ministerial bureaucracy: formal, functional and administrative politicization. The typology is empirically validated through a comparative case analysis of politicization mechanisms in Germany, Belgium, the UK and Denmark. The empirical analysis further refines the general idea of Western democracies becoming ‘simply’ more politicized, by illustrating how some politicization mechanisms do not continue to increase, but stabilize – at least for the time being.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramesh, Ramasamy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does Trust Matter?

Citizen distrust in government and its institutions considerably affects the effectiveness and efficiency of public policies and their implementation. Since the independence, Sri Lanka has been regarded as a third world democracy with a strong welfare state system in which public institutions have played pivotal role in fostering democracy and citizen trust. Nevertheless, in the recent past, citizen trust in most public institutions has been alarmingly decreasing owing to politicization of public sector, service delivery, political and bureaucratic corruption, lack of transparency, accountability, ethnic prejudice and partiality in the working of the public institutions. In this backdrop, this paper examines the level of citizen trust in selected institutions and explores factors that influence on trust. The study adopted mixed method approach to explore the problem phenomenon. The study finds that ethnic majority has more trust in public institutions than that of minority, and identity, language of administration and lack of equal representation in bureaucracy are also considerably determine level of trust citizens have in public institutions. Further, political patronage in service delivery has subverted quality of public institutions and trust, interestingly, citizens those who support and being affiliated with ruling party tend to have more trust in government. Police and village-level officers are least trusted owing to endemic corruption.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Derlien, Hans-Ulrich</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mandarins or managers?

The man-darin status of the administrative elite prevails, despite a long-term decrease in the share of jurists and more open career patterns, both due to a first managerialist turn in the 1970s. It is argued that new administrative policies are carried out like any other substantive policy. On the polity dimension, the bureaucracy's function as the center of expertise is reflected in terms of both formal education and subjective role understanding. On the policy dimension, the 1970 reformist agenda of the Brandt government resulted in higher programmatic commitment than at the point of replication of the base line study in 1987, when the Kohl government was consolidating public finances. Under conditions such as those prevailing after national unification in 1990 and since about 1995, though, top administrators can turn quite managerial. The most significant change is observed on the politics dimension: growing party politicization of the administrative elite, in particular after fundamental government changes (1969, 1982, 1998) examined here. Functional as it may be for streamlining the ministries, the extent of party patronage may, in the long run, undermine the still-high trust in executive institutions in Germany.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soeters, Joseph L.</author><author>Tessema, Mussie Teclemichael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Public management in developing countries: Some notes on Eritrea</title><secondary-title>International Review of Administrative Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Review of Administrative Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>623-635</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0020852304048446</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SOETERS TESSEMA Public management in developing countries 2004.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Eritrea</label><abstract>A system of adequately performing public bureaucracies is a basic requirement for developing countries to progress and prosper. However, public management in developing countries is often threatened by politicization and ineffective human resource management policies. In this article, we analyse public management in Eritrea, one of the world's poorest countries that gained independence in the early 1990s. In this analysis, we use general (western) theoretical frames of reference, including pre-modern, weberian and new public management lines of thinking. It will show that, in current Eritrea, all known styles of public management concur and collide and that this situation is related to the cultural, educational and political background of the various population groups that strive for job opportunities in the public sector's strategic apex. This collision of styles may lead to frustration and ineffectiveness among the people involved. Only a managerial policy stressing practical wisdom and intelligence may satisfy all the groups of people engaged in Eritrea's public management, in fact in all developing countries' public organizations.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balint, Tim</author><author>Bauer, Michael W.</author><author>Knill, Christoph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bureaucratic change in the European administrative space: The case of the European commission</title><secondary-title>West European Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>West European Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>677-700</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01402380801905967</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BALIN ET AL Bureaucratic change in the European administrative space European Commission 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>In this article, we compare bureaucratic change in the European Commission with developments in the public administrations of the member states of the European Union using two standard features of the study of comparative public administration: the degree of politicisation of the higher management and the degree of openness of the career system. The empirical data shows that the Commission started as a public administration in the Continental tradition and over time partially moved towards the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian models. At the same time, the majority of the member states remained rather stable with regard to their position along the two administrative dimensions under study. We argue that none of the mechanisms commonly invoked to explain organisational change - functional adaptation, path dependency, isomorphism or policy windows - can convincingly account for the complete pattern and the magnitude of change that we observe in the case of the European Commission. While we find no convincing support for the relevance of functional adaptation or path dependency, the concepts of isomorphism and policy windows provide a more promising basis for understanding at least some aspects of the empirical development.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gains, Francesca</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Narratives and dilemmas of local bureaucratic elites: Whitehall at the coal face?</title><secondary-title>Public Administration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Administration</full-title></periodical><pages>50-64</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1467-9299.2008.01741.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>*local (evaluate again)</notes><research-notes>*local (evaluate again)</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GAINS Narrative Dilemmas of Local Elites 2009.PDF</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>UK</label><abstract>The worlds of local bureaucrats are under researched and under theorized compared with those of civil servants in core executives. Yet local bureaucratic elites, sitting as they do between central states and localities, are key actors in governance networks. In England, the role and responsibilities of local bureaucratic elites has been transformed since the days of professionalized officers heading departmental structures reporting to committees, firstly by NPM and politicization in the 1980s and 1990s and, more recently, by political management reform introducing a separation of powers. Drawing on interviews in 15 local authorities, this paper examines the changing narratives and dilemmas of local government elites.

Until the mid-1990s, the former were distinguished from the latter by certain interrelated structural characteristics. These characteristics were extended politicisation of the top administrative ranks; enduring patronage patterns in recruitment to the public sector; uneven distribution of human resources; formalism and legalism; and, with the exception of Spain, absence of a typical European administrative elite. The characteristics were related to the type of capitalism and political development in Southern Europe. South European bureaucracies have started evolving towards decentralisation and privatisation. However, convergence with the bureaucracies of other EU member-states is an open question. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Napolio, Nicholas G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Implementing presidential particularism: Bureaucracy and the distribution of federal grants</title><secondary-title>Political Science Research and Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Political Science Research and Methods</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>American politics</keyword><keyword>political economy</keyword><keyword>presidency and executive politics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/psrm.2021.29</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NAPOLIO bureaucracy and the distribution of federal grants 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Do agencies implement the president's particularistic goals uniformly? This paper clarifies the presidential particularism literature by explicitly considering the mechanism through which the president pursues their policy goals: Executive agencies. The constellation of bureaucratic agencies responsible for allocating grants plays a key role in facilitating or frustrating presidential policy priorities. Using a dataset of 21 agencies over 14 years, I find that only agencies ideologically proximate to the president engage in particularism benefiting the president. I find no evidence that politicization influences agency implementation of particularism. Critically, the moderating effect of the bureaucracy on particularism only occurs for distributive programs over which agencies have discretion. When disbursing formula grants written by Congress but administered by the bureaucracy with little or no discretion, ideological distance between agencies and presidents has no effect on particularism.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luca, Davide</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Boon or bane for development?

The current paper aims to understand this empirical puzzle by exploring whether the ‘relatively sound’ management of public investment can be explained by the characteristics of the central economic bureaucracy. It draws on process-tracing analysis and in-depth elite interviews. In line with the developmental state literature, the analysis argues that authoritative and insulated public administrations are essential for policy effectiveness, particularly in institutional contexts prone to a high politicisation of the public purse. Yet, in order to prevent bureaucratic capture, bureaus must also be accountable. The analysis in particular shows how increasing the transparency of the state and allowing a stronger oversight of policy performance by the public and the media are extremely important. Conversely, transformations which simply reduce the powers of strong, top-down bureaucracies to increase the indiscriminate control by governments – such as the ones which have occurred in Turkey in recent years – will not lead to stronger institutions, but merely produce different ineffective and unsustainable structures.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gailmard, Sean</author><author>Patty, John Wiggs</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Slackers and zealots: Civil service, policy discretion, and bureaucratic expertise</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Political Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Political Science</full-title></periodical><pages>873-889</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00286.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GAILMARD PATTY  Civil Service Policy Discretion and Bureaucratic Expertise 2007.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We investigate how aspects of &quot;civil service&quot; systems of personnel management interact with bureaucratic discretion to create expert bureaucracies populated by policy-motivated agents. We construct a dynamic model in which bureaucrats may invest in (relationship-specific) policy expertise and may or may not be interested in policy choices per se. The legislature makes sequentially rational grants of discretion, which serve as incentives for expertise investment and continued service only for policy-motivated bureaucrats. Bureaucratic policy preferences and the legislature's agency problem vis-à-vis bureaucracies develop endogenously in the model. Bureaucratic expertise can be supported in equilibrium only at a cost of its politicization; &quot;neutral competence&quot; is inconsistent with strategic incentives of bureaucrats. We identify several conditions that support the development of an expert bureaucracy in equilibrium, including security of job tenure and control over policy issues for policy-motivated bureaucrats.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Diamond, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Externalization and politicization in policy advisory systems: a case study of contestable policy-making 2010–2015</title><secondary-title>Public Money and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Money and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>42-51</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Whitehall paradigm</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>policy advisory systems</keyword><keyword>politicization</keyword><keyword>post-bureaucratic state</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/09540962.2019.1583890</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DIAMOND Externalization and politicization 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>UK</label><abstract>This paper contends that since 2010 in the UK, there has been an unprecedented attempt to disrupt the traditional civil service ‘monopoly’ over policy advice, outsourcing policy-making to actors beyond the central state. The author argues that the policy-making processes of Whitehall and Westminster governance are being radically overhauled. In many Anglophone countries, ministers have sought to reduce their structural dependence on the permanent civil service. In so doing, ministers sought to gain political control over the machinery of policy-making. These efforts to restructure the permanent bureaucracy have had unintended consequences, however. The policy process in the UK state has become more fragmented, as policy-making and implementation have increasingly diverged. IMPACT: Those policy-makers and practitioners who have contact with civil servants and government ministers need to better understand the more fluid and unpredictable policy environment that is emerging at various tiers of UK governance, shaped by a multiplicity of actors sitting within, and outside, the formal boundaries of the state. The diverse ecology of policy-making institutions includes think-tanks, research institutes, non-governmental organizations, charities, community groups, management consultancies, and professional services companies, all of whom are involved in directly providing policy advice to ministers. The ‘monopoly’ over policy-making traditionally enjoyed by the civil service is eroding, with important implications for the work of policy-makers and public managers who have to negotiate the more fractious system of Whitehall bureaucracy. A subtle but perceptible shift is occurring whereby elected politicians and their advisers are gaining greater control over the policy-making processes of the UK state.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bös, Dieter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contests among bureaucrats</title><secondary-title>Public Choice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Choice</full-title></periodical><pages>359-380</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><publisher>KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/b:puch.0000033327.79419.cc</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BOS Contest Among Bureaucrats 2004.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>This paper deals with double lobbying: several bureaucrats participate in joint lobbying to get a high total departmental budget, but they also engage in antagonistic lobbying to reap as high a share of the total budget as possible.

However, institutional barriers-such as the requirement for legislative confirmation-exist that may make pursuing a strategy of responsive competence difficult, if not impossible. Here, I examine a model of bureaucratic appointments that allows for informationally imperfect agencies. I show that when legislative assent is required, trade-offs between ideology and either patronage or agency performance-or both-are often required to ensure legislative confirmation. The same dynamics are not present for unilateral appointments. Finally, using a data set that incorporates the ideologies of federal program managers, the performance of federal programs, and whether program managers were patronage appointees, I conduct a series of empirical tests that support the model's predictions.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McEachern, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest groups in North Korean politics</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN STUDIES</full-title></periodical><pages>235-258</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>DPRK</keyword><keyword>KWP</keyword><keyword>NDC</keyword><keyword>North Korea</keyword><keyword>cabinet</keyword><keyword>institutions</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>pluralism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>LYNNE RIENNER PUBL INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/s1598240800005312</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MCEACHERN Interest Groups in North Korea 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Korea</label><abstract>North Korea is often characterized as some form of highly centralized rule: totalitarian, posttotalitarian, corporatist, or personalistic.

The article documents how the state's political institutions have changed since the country's founding and highlights the formal and informal roles of each major bureaucracy today. The Korean Workers Party and the role of Juche have declined, but the National Defense Commission and &quot;military-first politics&quot; have not taken their place as reigning supreme.

We expect this relationship is conditional on if the position addresses a stereotypically feminine or masculine policy area. As women are less politically ambitious and perceive electoral disadvantages in running for masculine positions, we expect the pool of women willing to accept an appointed masculine position is greater than those willing to run for elected office. However, for feminine positions, women may perceive their gender as an advantage and are more willing to run. Using original data of state executive leaders, we find women are more likely to serve in elected than appointed feminine positions, but the opposite is true for masculine positions. This article provides insight into how institutional decisions can impact the presence of underrepresented groups in government.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>West, William F</author><author>Cheon, Ohbet</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Allocation of Excepted Political Positions: What and Whose Executive Priorities Do They Serve?</title><secondary-title>CONGRESS \&amp; THE PRESIDENCY-A JOURNAL OF CAPITAL STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CONGRESS \&amp; THE PRESIDENCY-A JOURNAL OF CAPITAL STUDIES</full-title></periodical><pages>446-470</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \&amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07343469.2019.1616334</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://WEST CHEON The Allocation of Excepted Political Positions 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Scholars have only begun to examine the roles played by non-career SES and Schedule C personnel in managing the bureaucracy. This, despite the fact that these individuals help to establish, communicate, and implement policy, and despite the broad discretion presidential administrations have in appointing them, defining their duties, and allocating their positions across the federal government. As an effort to redress this neglect, we first provide an overview of what lower-level political personnel do and of the processes and constraints that determine how they are distributed. We then examine how changes in presidential administration have affected the allocation of political SES and Schedule C positions across departments. Although dramatic infusions of these personnel into some agencies can be tied to policy objectives, they appear to be idiosyncratic and driven more by the preferences of agency leaders than by the White House. As such, they provide little support for positive theories that frame the administrative presidency in terms of centralized strategic planning.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bolton, AlexandThe Constraining Power of the Purse: Executive Discretion and Legislative Appropriationser</author><author>Thrower, Sharece</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Constraining Power of the Purse: Executive Discretion and Legislative Appropriations</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>1266-1281</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>executive discretion</keyword><keyword>separation-of-powers politics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA</pub-location><publisher>UNIV CHICAGO PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/704330</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BOLTON TROWER Discretion Power 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Discretion is fundamental to understanding interbranch interactions in the US separation-of-powers system. Yet, measuring discretion is challenging. The few existing measures have difficulty capturing both delegation and constraint in a consistent way over time. In this article, we propose a novel measure of executive discretion based on legislative appropriations to all agencies, weighted by spending limitations imposed by Congress in appropriations committee reports. We provide evidence for the validity of the measure, including a test of the ally principle to establish construct validity. Finally, we demonstrate the wider utility of the measure by employing it to evaluate hypotheses about how political control over the bureaucracy influences congressional policy making in the context of discretion. We show that agency design and presidential control are important factors in congressional decisions. Overall, we present a versatile measure of discretion that researchers can use to explore a variety of questions in American politics.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ouyang, Yu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Introduction to the Symposium on Presidential Management and Control of the Bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY</full-title></periodical><pages>4-9</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA</pub-location><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/psq.12766</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://OUYANG Presidential Management and Control of the Bureaucracy 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Terada, Mayu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Changing Nature of Bureaucracy and Governing Structure in Japan</title><secondary-title>WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>431-459</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>4045 BROOKLYN AVENUE NE, SEATTLE, WA 98105 USA</pub-location><publisher>UNIV WASHINGTON</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TERADA Bureaucracy and Governing Structure Japan 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Japan;definition of politicization;political appointments</label><abstract>This paper analyzes and criticizes changes in the relationship between politics and the bureaucracy, in Japan up to the present from the viewpoint of administrative organizations and related public law system. Drastic changes in the legal system, or legal reform, may sometimes undermine the true intention of the policy and its implementation. Thus, bringing political leadership in administrative decision-making bodies cannot be easily concluded as better or worse than the complete separation of administration and government. To analyze this matter in detail, this paper looks at the following points: 1) Analysis of the operation of the limited political appointment system under the one-party dominance by the Liberal Democratic Party and several attempts of administrative reform; 2) Changes in the government in 1993 that broke the Liberal Democratic Party's rule and subsequent changes in executive personnel and political leadership by the prime minister's office; and 3) The establishment of the Cabinet Bureau of Personnel Affairs in May 2014, which strengthened the involvement of the Cabinet in the executive staff personnel. Through an analysis of these changes, the institutional basis of the current phenomenon of increasing enforcement power and expanding administrative power is presented. Then this article considers current problems of democratic legitimacy within institutional limitations and policymaking, coordination of political leadership and securing administrative expertise. As a conclusion, this paper considers the requirement of separation of power in Japan and possible solutions to the increasing influence of political leadership on administrative power.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Selin, Jennifer L.</author><author>Drolc, Cody A.</author><author>Butcher, Jordan</author><author>Brothers, Nicholas L.</author><author>Brant, Hanna K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Under Pressure: Centralizing Regulation in Response to Presidential Priorities</title><secondary-title>PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY</full-title></periodical><pages>340-366</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA</pub-location><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/psq.12764</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SELIN ET AL Centralizing Regulation inResponse to Presidential Priorities 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>The modern presidency is one of administration, where presidents seek to further their own agendas by directing administrative behavior throughout the executive branch.

Taking ``public servants with higher education{''} as a proxy for identifying professional bureaucrats, we sought to determine the scale of participation in the municipal public service and the extent to which a greater proportion of servants recruited by means of an entrance exam, involving job stability and further education, may be associated with a greater chance of implementing an agenda of urban policies. The results indicate that even when controlled by demographic or electoral variables, the presence of professional bureaucracy served as a reliable link to an increased chance of introducing regulatory legislation on the urban space in Brazilian municipalities. Immune to electoral and governmental cycles, professional bureaucrats may utilize various technical and informative resources as well as political and organizational incentives for offsetting the decisions based on heavy political pressure generated by this kind of legislation.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Doherty, Kathleen M.</author><author>Lewis, David E.</author><author>Limbocker, Scott</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Executive Control and Turnover in the Senior Executive Service</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</full-title></periodical><pages>159-174</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>OXFORD UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jopart/muy069</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DOHERTY ET AL Executive Control and Turnover in the Senior Executive Service 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>If presidents wish to see their policy priorities implemented, they need control over key decision-making positions often occupied by career executives. This article examines whether political conflict with a new administration drives career executives from their positions. This can happen because presidents target specific individuals or because career professionals anticipate conflict and strategically exit before a new president takes office. To assess this dynamic, we use novel data that combine individual survey responses with personnel records to analyze the probability that an agency executive departs her position from March 2015 to July 2017. Given our findings that turnover is driven by both presidential marginalization and strategic exit by bureaucrats, we conclude with implications for presidential efforts to control the bureaucracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chudnovsky, Mariana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tension between Merit and Trust in the Top Managerial Levels of Latin American Civil Services [La tensión entre mérito y confianza en la Alta Dirección Pública de América Latina]</title><secondary-title>REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA</full-title></periodical><pages>5-40</pages><issue>69</issue><keywords><keyword>Argentina</keyword><keyword>Chile</keyword><keyword>Peru</keyword><keyword>assignment</keyword><keyword>civil service reform</keyword><keyword>executive</keyword><keyword>merit system</keyword><keyword>personnel administration</keyword><keyword>politics and administration</keyword><keyword>public managers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>AV PRINCIPAL LOS CHORROS, CRUCE CON AV 6, CASA CLAD, URB LOS CHORROS, PO 4181, CARACAS 1071, CARACAS, 1010-A, VENEZUELA</pub-location><publisher>CLAD-LATINOAMERICANO ADMINISTRACION DESARROLLO</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CHUDNOVSKY Tensión entre Mérito y Confianza en América Latina 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Argentina;Chile;Peru;political appointments</label><abstract>This paper aims to rethink whether the solution to the politization of the Latin American managerial levels in the public sector is always to try to establish contests based on merit for all appoitments. Comparative evidence in the region shows that seeking to completely eliminate political appointments can be counterproductive since the political reaction is so massive that no appointments are made based on merit. This argument is illustrated with the Argentine case in light of the experiences of both the cases of Chile and Peru, which were able to improve their civil services including the p olitical component in their processes. In Argentina, despite the existence of norms that force the creation of an open, meritocratic and competitive selection system for the managerial levels -since its approval in 2008- nothing happened. Maybe it is necessary to rethink the role of politics, but not only from its negative consecuences, but also as a way to allow the so needed reforms. Political appointments can be a part of the process of selection of top managerial positions in an organized and monitored way, as both the cases of Peru and Chile show.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bresler-Gonen, Rotem</author><author>Dowding, Keith</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Shifting and Shirking Political Appointments for Contracting Out Services in Israeli Local Government</title><secondary-title>URBAN AFFAIRS REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>URBAN AFFAIRS REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>807-831</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>agency problems</keyword><keyword>policy drift</keyword><keyword>political appointments</keyword><keyword>principal</keyword><keyword>sanitation</keyword><keyword>shirking</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><pub-location>2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA</pub-location><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1078087408328050</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BRESLER GONEN Political Appointments Local Israel 2009.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Israel;political appointments</label><abstract>Principal-agent models in public administration concentrate upon policy drift-when agencies allow policy to drift away from the bliss point of executive politicians. We distinguish two types of policy drift: policy shifting and agent shirking. The first occurs when agents' political bliss points are located differently from those of their principals. The second occurs when agents do not competently carry out their principals' wishes. One response to policy shift is to appoint agents who share the bliss point of the principal, allowing the reduction of costly monitoring. Through 10 cases in three Israeli cities where political appointments were made to push through structural changes to contract out services, we show that political appointees are less effective than career bureaucrats, so that solving shifting often increases shirking, especially when monitoring is reduced. The agency problems thus created were only solved by increasing monitoring and returning to career civil servants.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Makita, Jun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A study of the functions of political appointees from a comparative perspective</title><secondary-title>ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>146-161</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1, SI</issue><keywords><keyword>advice</keyword><keyword>decision-making</keyword><keyword>interface</keyword><keyword>political appointees</keyword><keyword>politico-administrative relation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/20578911211036943</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MAKITA A study of the functions of political appointees from a comparative perspective 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>comparative studies;how to measure politicisation</label><abstract>In this article, the functions of political appointees have been classified by an index on the relation between politics and bureaucracy.

Presidents need a mixture of experienced and loyal officers to promote bureaucratic competence and responsiveness, and advance their policies within the executive branch, but scholars' focus has often been senatorial obstructionism rather than when presidents prefer loyal nominees and experienced nominees. This study uses a sample of 573 subcabinet nominations between 1961 and 2006, and relates presidents' nominee choices to their policy priorities and departmental jurisdictions. It finds that presidents nominate significantly more loyalists and fewer experienced officers to higher priority departments, indicating the importance of responsiveness, as well as their suspicion of experienced officers. Presidents select more experienced nominees for lower priority departments to assure competence where they are least concerned with responsiveness. Furthermore, it finds that increased Senate ideological opposition has no significant effect on presidents' selections.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nixon, David C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Appointment delay for vacancies on the federal communications commission</title><secondary-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>483-492</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><pub-location>350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA</pub-location><publisher>BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/0033-3352.00051</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NIXON FCC Appointments 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Confirmation politics for judicial appointees is an exhaustively studied phenomenon, but the politics of appointment for independent agencies is less well understood, because nominees are very rarely rejected and the Senate fails even to hold a recorded vote for most appointees. However, alternative evidence of conflict between the president and the Senate is available: the length of time it takes to fill a vacancy on a board or commission. An empirical assessment of FCC vacancies, based on an exponential regression model of vacancy duration, demonstrates that statutory restrictions on the partisanship of the board significantly deteriorate the efficiency of the appointment process. In addition, the appointment of minorities (though not of women) occurs only after unusually drawn-out appointments. A straightforward test of whether divided government leads to extended vacancies turns up negative.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Demir, Fatih</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Depolitization of Bureaucracy: The Case of Central and Eastern European Countries</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</full-title></periodical><pages>54-64</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>CEECs (Central and Eastern European countries)</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>depolitization</keyword><keyword>neutrality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \&amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01900692.2015.1072556</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DEMIR Depolitization of Bureaucracy Europe 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Central and Eastern European countries</label><abstract>Political parties worldwide seek to work with bureaucrats who are close to their programs, willing to cooperate, and concerted. On the other hand, there is a huge body of literature which argues that bureaucracy should be separate from politics and that it has to consist of public servants who are technically knowledgeable, expert, and also politically neutral. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe suffered from highly politicized public administrations under one-party regimes, and have struggled to separate their bureaucracies from politics since early 1990s. In view of the relation between politics and bureaucracy from the perspective of (de) politization, this paper looks into the changes that Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) have gone through after the institutionalization of multi-party regimes and tries to provide some generalizations.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Xiao</author><author>Wang, Yinglun</author><author>Yi, Hongtao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Data Manipulation through Patronage Networks: Evidence from Environmental Emissions in China</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</full-title></periodical><volume>XX</volume><issue>XX</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>OXFORD UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jopart/muac019</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TANG ET AL Data Manipulation and Patronage 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Data manipulation is considered one of the most pernicious forms of information distortion that challenges the effectiveness of the principals in monitoring agents. This study investigates factors influencing the behaviors of data manipulation from the perspective of patronage networks. Patronage networks feature a reciprocal exchange between patrons who control appealing resources and clients who ask for protection and benefits from the patrons. We hypothesize that in a three-tier principal-supervisor-agent model, agents favored in the patronage network would receive tacit permission and protection from the supervisor, and hence be encouraged to falsify performance data and game the principal. The empirical results, using panel regression models based on officially reported and satellite-observed environmental emissions data in China, suggest that cities with leaders favored in the patronage network present a stronger tendency for data manipulation. This study has theoretical implications for understanding the impact of informal institutions on performance management.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Selin, Jennifer L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What Makes an Agency Independent?</title><secondary-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>971-987</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA</pub-location><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/ajps.12161</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SELIN Agency Independence 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>The responsiveness of government agencies to elected officials is a central question in democratic governance. A key source of variation in responsiveness is agency structure. Yet scholars often view agencies as falling into broad structural categories (e.g., cabinet departments or independent commissions) or fixate on some features of design (e.g., for cause protections). I develop new estimates of structural independence based on new data on 50 different structural features of 321 federal agencies in the federal executive establishment. Using a Bayesian latent variable model, I estimate independence on two dimensions: limits on the appointment of key agency decision makers and limits on political review of agency policy. I illustrate the value of this new measure by using it to examine how structure affects political influence and how agency independence can vary over time.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hollibaugh Jr., Gary E.</author><author>Rothenberg, Lawrence S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Who, When, and Where of Executive Nominations: Integrating Agency Independence and Appointee Ideology</title><secondary-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>296-311</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA</pub-location><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/ajps.12345</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HOLLIBAUGH JR  ROTHENBERG Executive Nominations 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>In recent years, scholars have expended considerable efforts to understand the executive appointment process and the forces influencing the choices made by the president and the Senate. However, some factors integral to theoretical models have not been well integrated empirically, and other relevant factors have not been incorporated much at all. Here, we focus on one determinant corresponding to the former critique-nominee ideology-and another corresponding to the latter-the independence of decision makers in the targeted agencies. We examine a series of theoretically driven hypotheses regarding the effects of both ideology and independence on who gets nominated and if and when nominees are eventually confirmed. Results show nominee ideology and decision maker independence matter a great deal and factor into presidential strategic choices and senatorial responses in ways according to expectations. Our findings have important ramifications for understanding appointments empirically and for future theoretical development.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harris, Adam S</author><author>Meyer-Sahling, Jan-Hinrik</author><author>Mikkelsen, Kim Sass</author><author>Schuster, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activating the ``Big Man{''}: Social Status, Patronage Networks, and Pro-Social Behavior in African Bureaucracies</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>XX</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>OXFORD UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jopart/muac009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HARRIS ET AL Patronage Networks, and Pro-Social Behavior in African Bureaucracies 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Africa</label><abstract>Public service delivery by African states is often characterized as particularist, favoring ethnic, personal or political networks of those inside the state over universalist, pro-social services to citizens. One explanation for particularist service delivery focuses on societal patronage norms, with ``Big Men{''} providing for members of their networks. Despite the prominence of this line of reasoning and the anecdotal prevalence of ``Big Men{''} in politics and society, hardly any research has quantitatively assessed the effects of ``big man{''} governance inside the state. Through a behavioral experiment with over 1,300 Ugandan bureaucrats, our article seeks to address this gap. In the experiment, we find that activating social status-that is, ``big man{''} status-in bureaucrats embedded in patronage networks significantly curbs their pro-social behavior. Our article contributes an important empirical micro-foundation to help explain one cause of limited universal service delivery by bureaucrats.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Tao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How Bureaucratic Power Structure Affects Personnel Structure Evidence from Europe</title><secondary-title>PROBLEMS OF POST-COMMUNISM</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PROBLEMS OF POST-COMMUNISM</full-title></periodical><pages>83-95</pages><volume>66</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \&amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/10758216.2017.1315309</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LI How Bureaucratic Power Structure Affects Personnel Structure 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>comparative studies</label><abstract>Parallel streams of literature in economics and management suggest that a centralized power structure tends to produce a top-heavy personnel structure in government bureaucracies.

Within Eastern Europe, countries that have preserved Soviet-style bureaucratic power structures have the most top-heavy ministries, whereas others that have reduced power centralization by separating political and administrative power have less top-heavy ministry pyramids that are more like those found in Western Europe.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Llano, Mercedes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>THE POLITICAL DETERMINANTS OF PROFESSIONALIZATION PROCESSES IN LATIN AMERICA.

We find that, conditional on a number of economic, political, and legal factors, countries where bureaucracies are more insulated from day-to-day oversight by individual politicians through the institutional features under consideration tend to have both better regulation, specifically business regulation, and higher rates of business entry.

To move towards merit in practice, legislation which mandates merit recruitment is considered a necessary but insufficient first step by many scholars and practitioners. Merit-based civil service legislation should thus be sought before reform in practice. This article challenges this reasoning. It argues that merit laws are neither sufficient nor necessary: they leave the incumbent's possibility frontier for patronage and meritocracy in practice unaffected. Large- and small-n evidence supports this assertion. Analyses of an original dataset of coded civil service legislation in 117 countries from 1975 to 2015 suggest that countries can attain meritocratic recruitment with and without legal merit requirements. Subsequently, a comparison of Paraguay and the Dominican Republic provides micro-evidence for the underlying mechanism. Conventional wisdom about the sequencing of governance reforms in developing countries may thus be misleading: legal reform need not come first.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gomide, Alexandre de Ávila</author><author>Lins, Rafael da Silva</author><author>Machado, Raphael Amorim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bureaucracy and public administration performance: in search of theories and evidence for administrative reforms in developing countries [BUROCRACIA E DESEMPENHO DA ADMINISTRAÇÃO PÚBLICA: EM BUSCA DE TEORIAS E EVIDÊNCIAS PARA REFORMAS ADMINISTRATIVAS EM P</title><secondary-title>CADERNOS GESTAO PUBLICA E CIDADANIA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CADERNOS GESTAO PUBLICA E CIDADANIA</full-title></periodical><volume>26</volume><issue>84</issue><keywords><keyword>administrative reform</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>corruption</keyword><keyword>developing countries</keyword><keyword>performance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><pub-location>S-N-602 MODULO A-B-C, ASA NORTE, DF 70830-05, BRAZIL</pub-location><publisher>FUNDACAO GETULIO VARGAS ESCOLA ADM EMPRESAS SAO PAULO</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.12660/cgpc.v26n84.83067</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GOMIDE Bureaucracy and public administration performance 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The study aims to contribute to the discussion about the State in the 21st century by pointing to some critical features of public bureaucracy that deserve more empirical research to provide ,evidence to support proposals for administrative reform in developing countries.

The findings corroborate the theoretical arguments that, in addition to attractive salaries and recruitment by competitive public examinations, a special work regime with career stability for civil servants has significant relationships with reduction of corruption and improvement of public governance in the group of developing countries.

I distinguish between low- and high-skilled positions and argue that the former are valuable for sustaining party machines, while manipulating the latter can undermine state performance. Accordingly, politicians will interfere to ensure their copartisans are hired to low-skilled jobs but select bureaucrats for high-skilled positions based on meritocratic criteria. I test my argument using novel bureaucrat-level data from Ghana (n=17,942) and leverage a change in the governing party to investigate hiring patterns. The results suggest that partisan bias is confined to low-ranked jobs. The findings shed light on the mixed effects of electoral competition on patronage identified in prior studies: competition may dissuade politicians from interfering in recruitment to high-ranked positions but encourage them to hire partisans for low-ranked positions.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kenny, Paul D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Origins of Patronage Politics: State Building, Centrifugalism, and Decolonization</title><secondary-title>BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>141-171</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA</pub-location><publisher>CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S000712341300015X</electronic-resource-num><notes>Although the period is outside the scope of the research, the author approaches the effects of the phenomenon today.</notes><research-notes>Although the period is outside the scope of the research, the author approaches the effects of the phenomenon today.</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://KENNY The origins of patronage 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Ceylon;India</label><abstract>This article develops a two-part theory that accounts for both the origins and the persistence of patronage politics. First, greater centrifugal and disintegrative pressures at key moments in the state-building process give local elites more opportunity to institutionalize patronage at the subnational level. Second, decentralized patronage systems are more resistant to reform than centralized ones. Case studies of India and Ceylon illustrate how variation in centrifugal pressures allowed subnational elites to capture the state in the former but not the latter. Further data from the British Empire shows that greater centrifugal pressures faced by British colonies at the time of decolonization are correlated with the persistence of higher levels of patronage over time.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cooper, Christopher A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Encouraging civil servants to be frank and fearless: Merit recruitment and employee voice</title><secondary-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</full-title></periodical><pages>721-735</pages><volume>96</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA</pub-location><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/padm.12548</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://COOPER Merit Recruitment and Employee Voice 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Canada</label><abstract>Recruiting civil servants on the basis of merit is believed to improve the quality of governance because it increases the bureaucracy's expertise, leads bureaucrats to develop distinct preferences and encourages them to candidly voice their opinions to others. Yet, to date, the reason why merit recruitment positively affects employee voice remains theoretically vague and has received little empirical scrutiny. This article advances this research by theoretically specifying why merit recruitment positively affects employee voice, and by empirically testing this association with survey data measuring the perceptions of federal civil servants in Canada. Controlling for several additional factors believed to influence employee voice, the results from various multivariate regression models show a robust and statistically significant association between merit recruitment and fear to voice a dissenting opinion. The more civil servants believe that merit recruitment is high, the less they fear reprisal for expressing a dissenting opinion to their superiors.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Jingnan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Supreme Leaders, Provincial Leaders, and Factional Competition in China's Anti-Corruption Enforcement: Regional- and City-Level Evidence</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>133-153</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>anti-corruption campaign</keyword><keyword>corruption</keyword><keyword>elite competition</keyword><keyword>factions/patron-client networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS</pub-location><publisher>SPRINGER</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11366-021-09753-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LIU Supreme Leaders Provincial Leaders China 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>China</label><abstract>Corruption is a great challenge for China. The supreme leaders of the Chinese Communist Party face a trade-off between cracking down on corruption and maintaining the stability and loyalty of the party-state apparatus. This article argues that this dilemma is partially resolved via personal connections between supreme leaders and provincial cadres, which may selectively decrease the intensity of anti-corruption campaigns and stabilize local bureaucracies. Using a combination of province-year data and individual-year, city-level data, this study shows that provincial leaders who were part of supreme leaders' informal political networks were able to significantly reduce the probability that their local subordinates would be targeted by anti-corruption investigations. Future research should examine in greater detail whether supreme leaders' factional subordinates tend to be reliable agents or whether subordinates often prioritize their own goals over those of supreme leaders.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hollibaugh Jr., Gary E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Incompetence Trap: The (Conditional) Irrelevance of Agency Expertise</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>OXFORD UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jopart/muw066</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HOLLIBAUGH JR The Incompetence Trap 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Formal models of the appointments process typically cast the decision of the appointing executive as one where an open position is assumed and an appointee is chosen in order to maximize the utility of the executive (and perhaps that of the legislature if confirmation is required). However, several-often patronage-focused-processes within the appointments process focus instead on finding acceptable positions for ``necessary-to-place{''} individuals. Here, I develop a model where the goal is to find the best position for such an individual. In contrast to many existing models of the appointments process, I find that when the personnel process is focused on finding the best position for a given person as opposed to finding the best person for a given position, ``turkey farms{''}-agencies that have high numbers of minimally-competent (but necessary-to-place) individuals among their ranks-can result in equilibrium. Moreover, once agency capacity is sufficiently low, incompetent individual appointees no longer have detrimental effects on the utilities of the appointing principals, which further incentivizes the usage of certain agencies as ``turkey farms.{''}</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chipkin, Ivor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From democracy as a political system to democracy as government: a contribution to democratic theory from public administration</title><secondary-title>TRANSFORMATION-CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON SOUTHERN AFRICA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>TRANSFORMATION-CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON SOUTHERN AFRICA</full-title></periodical><pages>1-25</pages><volume>105</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><pub-location>KING GEORGE V AVE, GLENWOOD, DURBAN, KWAZULU-NATAL, 4041, SOUTH AFRICA</pub-location><publisher>UNIV KWAZULU-NATAL</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1353/trn.2021.0004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CHIPKIN Democratic Theory and Public Administration 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>South Africa</label><abstract>This paper argues that South Africa suffered a major democratic reversal after the election of Jacob Zuma as president of the country in 2009, especially from 2012 when the project of Radical Economic Transformation was pursued with vigour in State Owned Companies (SOEs).This reversal was invisible theoretically. Contemporary definitions of democracy, especially as they inform the literature on political transitions, reduce the phenomenon to the rules of political participation. Yet over the last ten years South Africa saw, not so much a rolling back of political rights as concerted attacks on the autonomy of state administrations. Without the conceptual tools to understand these attacks on the bureaucracy as attacks on democracy, the period from 2007 to 2017 has largely been construed in terms of corruption, criminality and patronage. This paper adds a new typology to democratic theory, reconciling a concept from public administration to democratic theory. It argues that we must think of bureaucratic autonomy as a democratic virtue.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yamin, Muhammad Nur</author><author>Guntur, Muhammad</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Witjaksono, A D</author><author>Tandyonomanu, D</author><author>Awaru, A O T</author><author>Pangalila, T</author><author>Tsuroyya</author><author>Fauzi, A F</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Mixing Politics and Competence in Promotion Office on Local Government (A Study at Regency Gowa and Makassar City of South Sulawesi Province)</title><secondary-title>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL SCIENCES (ICSS 2018)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL SCIENCES (ICSS 2018)</full-title></periodical><pages>1047-1050</pages><volume>226</volume><keywords><keyword>local government</keyword><keyword>politics and competence</keyword><keyword>promotion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE</pub-location><publisher>ATLANTIS PRESS</publisher><notes>1st International Conference on Social Sciences (ICSS), Bali, INDONESIA,

This research is quantitative, Data analysis techniques are multiple linear regression. Data collection techniques using questionnaires and interviews. The Respondents are 109 people of 305 people on structural officials in the scope of the Gowa Regency Government and the Makassar City government by using proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The research findings are the politics (X1) has a stronger influence than the competency (X2) in the promotion of local government bureaucracy, with the regression equation Y = 0.518 + 0.511 (X1)+0.420 (X2)+e, the influence of political aspects in promotion is dominated by the element of power expansion and job distribution because both are the basis for strengthening the dominance of the leader. Regarding aspects of competence, elements of knowledge and skills are very dominant influences in the promotion of the Office, both of which become indicators of employee reliability and professionalism. The strong influence of the political aspect compared aspect of the influence of competency in promotions Office, because the interests of political officials for trying to maintain power and career officials trying to maintain position. The promotion system combines merit system and patronage system, which is expected to get officials who have high competence and high integrity, without ignoring demands to accommodate supporters during the election of political official in the regional government.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barria Traverso, Diego</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Administrative careers in Chile, 1884-1920 Patronage or bureaucratic careers?</title><secondary-title>HISTORIA-SANTIAGO</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HISTORIA-SANTIAGO</full-title></periodical><pages>317-338</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Chile</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>civil servants</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>nineteenth  century</keyword><keyword>public administration</keyword><keyword>twentieth  century</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>AV VICUNA MACKENNA 4860, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE</pub-location><publisher>PONTIFICA UNIV CATOLICA CHILE, INST HISTORIA</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TRAVERSO Carreras en Chile 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Chile;patronage</label><abstract>Historians and contemporaries alike have criticized Chilean public administration during the Parliamentary period due to the emergence of clientelism in the selection of public workers.

According to the literature, this is usually caused by the politico-administrative inheritances that characterize this region, such as patronage, corruption, centralism and the lack of effective accountability mechanisms. By looking at Mexico's recent Civil Service reform process, this article shows that the development of new MBPP has been certainly constrained by some of those factors. However, the article also shows that a number of issues faced during the Mexican reform process can be linked to ``simpler{''} issues of policy design and implementation. The article thus concludes that while ``patronage{''}, ``amiguismo{''}, illegality, and other traditional features of Latin American (and Mexican) administrative systems remain a central impediment for developing well-functioning MBPP, academics and practitioners should probably pay more attention to policy design issues (e. g. policy co-ordination; time and resources availability; institutional framework design), which contribute to better explaining and understanding why MBPP implementation remains such a challenging task in this region.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tadić, Katarina</author><author>Elbasani, Arolda</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State-building and patronage networks: how political parties embezzled the bureaucracy in post-war Kosovo</title><secondary-title>SOUTHEAST EUROPEAN AND BLACK SEA STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOUTHEAST EUROPEAN AND BLACK SEA STUDIES</full-title></periodical><pages>185-202</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>2, SI</issue><keywords><keyword>European Union</keyword><keyword>Kosovo</keyword><keyword>United Nations</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>informality</keyword><keyword>international intervention</keyword><keyword>post-conflict state-building</keyword><keyword>recruitment</keyword><keyword>state capture</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \&amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14683857.2018.1474551</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TADIC ELBASANI State-building and patronage Kosovo 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Kosovo</label><abstract>Why has the internationally promoted Weberian-style bureaucracy failed to replace patronage as the dominant principle of state organization in post-war Kosovo? This article explores how international actors' rule-promotion activities and local actors' strategies of resistance play out and interact to explain the failure. The empirical analysis focuses on rules of recruitment in the civil service system in the period 2000-2016. The analysis juxtaposes two consecutive stages of the state-building process, which are marked by different degrees and forms of international involvement: the pre-independence period, 1999-2008; and post-independence period, 2008-2016. Evidence from the case suggests that during the pre-independence period, legal inconsistencies embedded in the internationally promulgated legislation enabled local actors' formal and informal strategies to recruit political cronies in the newly created civil service system. The transfer of authority from international administrators to elected local authorities, especially after Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008, did not solve the problem of legal inconsistencies, and instead, served to consolidate governing parties'strategies of control over recruitment in the state bureaucracy. More often than not, patron-client relationships that thrive at the borderline between formality and informality of political behaviour, continued to undermine external rule transfers.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vieira, Marcelo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Composition of the Cabinet and the Creation of Centralized Public Bureaucracies in the Brazilian Presidency</title><secondary-title>DADOS-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIAIS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>DADOS-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIAIS</full-title></periodical><pages>111-144</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>centralization</keyword><keyword>ministers</keyword><keyword>presidents</keyword><keyword>public bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>public servants</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>RUA DA MATRIZ 82, BOTAFOGO, RIO DE JANEIRO, 22260.100, BRAZIL</pub-location><publisher>INST UNIV PESQUISAS RIO DE JANEIRO-IUPERJ</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/001152582017116</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://VIEIRA Composição do Gabinete Pr Brasil 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Brazil</label><abstract>The aim of the following article is to analyze how the composition of the cabinets affects the creation of centralized bureaucracies in the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil.

The study analyzes 172 bodies created by the Brazilian federal public administration from 1990 to 2009, with individual bodies serving as the unit of analysis. With the aim of gauging the extent to which centralization shapes the Presidency, my binary dependent variable is whether a body created within the hierarchy of the Presidency or reallocated from the ministries to the Presidency. In order to assess the effects of the degree of conflicts among the coalition's preferences on the probability of presidential centralization, four binary logistic regression models were estimated, with the degree of ideological dispersion in the cabinet; the degree of politicization in the coalition; the degree of party fractionalization in the cabinet, and the degree of ideological extremism analyzed as key factors to the study.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cooper, Christopher A</author><author>Marier, Patrik</author><author>Halawi, Ali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The politics of senior bureaucratic turnover in the Westminster tradition: Trust and the choice between internal and external appointments</title><secondary-title>PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION</full-title></periodical><pages>179-202</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Westminster</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>control</keyword><keyword>politicization</keyword><keyword>trust</keyword><keyword>turnover</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0952076720929738</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://COOPER ET AL The politics of senior bureaucratic turnover in the Westminster tradition 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The extent to which new governments appoint and dismiss senior public servants is widely claimed to be influenced by their country's underlying administrative tradition. This is particularly the case within the Westminster tradition where such turnover is limited in nature, with most appointees coming from within the ranks of the public service. This article challenges the assertion that turnover in the Westminster tradition is homogeneously internal. Theorizing that new governments appoint senior public servants to increase their control over the bureaucracy, and that the desire for control is negatively correlated to trust, this article develops hypotheses between the trust new governments harbour towards the bureaucracy and whether they appoint and dismiss bureaucrats from within or outside the public service. The hypotheses are tested with longitudinal data measuring internal and external appointments and departures to the senior public service in Canada's provincial governments over a period of 18 years. The results from various multinomial regression models suggest that political appointments to the public service are not as homogenous as frequently suggested. Although a transition in the governing party and a newly elected premier from the same party of the previous government both lead to an increase in bureaucratic turnover, a newly elected first minister has a greater incidence of internal turnover than a change in party, meanwhile the level of external turnover does not meaningfully differ between these two political events.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ohberg, Patrik</author><author>Christiansen, Peter Munk</author><author>Niklasson, Birgitta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ADMINISTRATIVE POLITICIZATION OR CONTESTABILITY?

We deploy a Most Similar Systems comparison of Denmark and Sweden and include survey answers from 657 civil servants in managerial positions. We find that political recruitment of top civil servants, such as Swedish state secretaries, restricts the access of the civil service to the minister, but it does not substantially politicize the policy process. Danish civil servants perceive themselves as more contested by the relatively few Danish political advisers than their Swedish colleagues.

However, studies of the politicization of public employment do not tend to analyze the changes to the structure of the state apparatus as a strategy to incorporate public officials on the basis of discretionary appointments. Indeed, it is often noted that there are many ways of avoiding merit-based entry, though there is scarce empirical evidence about what these are and how they vary over time. To begin to fill this gap, this paper presents the influence of changes in the organizational structures of the state in the increase in discretionary appointments to the state apparatus. To do this, it examines the case of Argentina between the years 2003 and 2016.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dahlstrom, Carl</author><author>Lapuente, Victor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative Bureaucratic Politics</title><secondary-title>ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>43-63</pages><volume>25</volume><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>comparative politics</keyword><keyword>corruption</keyword><keyword>economic development</keyword><keyword>public administration</keyword><keyword>public services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA</pub-location><publisher>ANNUAL REVIEWS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-polisci-051120-102543</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DAHLSTROM LAPUENTE Comparative Bureaucratic Politics 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>comparative studies</label><abstract>This article discusses one of the most important institutions in the modern world, namely public bureaucracies, from a comparative perspective. Bureaucratic organizations can be seen as a result of handling dilemmas along two critical dimensions. The first dimension concerns whether bureaucrats should be autonomous or, on the contrary, directly accountable to their political masters. The second dimension is about whether bureaucrats should always be guided by the letter of the law, strictly following established rules, or, on the contrary, guided by the principle of management, searching for the most efficient solution. We review the extensive recent research on the effects of different ways of organizing public bureaucracies along these two dimensions. Specifically, we look at three fundamental outcomes: economic development, corruption, and the quality of public services. We conclude by discussing the pros and cons of the four types of bureaucracies-legalistic (accountability and law), populistic (accountability and management), Weberian (autonomy and law), and liberal (autonomy and management)-and how they relate to, but do not overlap with, the concept of administrative traditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Auer, Matthew R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presidential environmental appointees in comparative perspective</title><secondary-title>Public Administration Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Administration Review</full-title></periodical><pages>68-80</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00838.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 13</notes><research-notes>cited By 13</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AUER Presidential Appointments 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38049095208&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fj.1540-6210.2007.00838.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1cb38d858396f65bd48d15e6e9c77243</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The pathologies of the presidential appointment process are well documented and include appointees' frequent lack of federal government work experience and their short appointment tenures. Less well understood are whether and to what extent these problems affect different subsets of high-level appointees, such as administrators in the environmental bureaucracy. Top-tier environmental appointees tend to stay longer in their appointed positions than do presidential appointees generally, and more than 40 percent have prior federal government management experience. These and other data suggest that key problems ascribed to the presidential appointment process are less salient in the case of high-level environmental appointees. Appointees in Republican and Democratic administrations have comparable levels of academic training and federal government experience. These similarities notwithstanding, White House expectations for appointees' political loyalty varies more from administration to administration. The Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush (first term) administrations maintained the highest demands for political loyalty, with consequences for the policy-administration dichotomy in environmental agencies.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Chang Kil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The politicization of senior civil service in Korea: a human resource management perspective</title><secondary-title>ASIAN EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ASIAN EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES</full-title></periodical><pages>412-425</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>South Korea</keyword><keyword>human resources management</keyword><keyword>politicization</keyword><keyword>senior civil service</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND</pub-location><publisher>EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1108/AEDS-11-2017-0114</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LEE The politicization of senior civil service in Korea 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Korea</label><abstract>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the politicization of senior civil service (SCS) in Korea from a human resource perspective. To be specific, it is to explore how much the SCS has been politicized after its inception in 2006 and to discover what has strengthened it. Design/methodology/approach This paper employs the human resource management perspective with five stages, selection, rotation, education, promotion and compensation, which are related with different weights to four causes of politicization: political desire to control, leadership change, public demands and political interest. Findings This paper argues that politicization of SCS in Korea has gradually increased during the last 10 years. It also found that, while selection and promotion is strongly politicized, education and compensation is weakly politicized. Originality/value This paper mainly draws increasing politicization after it was introduced. Little prior literature has explored the politicization of SCS in human resource management processes and its causes for Korea.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Demirelli, Levent</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Different Meanings of the Politicization of Bureaucracy as a Concept: An Analysis Proposal based on Linguistics</title><secondary-title>AMME IDARESI DERGISI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMME IDARESI DERGISI</full-title></periodical><pages>1-31</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>antonymy</keyword><keyword>bureaucratic politics approach</keyword><keyword>classical approach</keyword><keyword>politicization of bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>principle-agent approach</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><pub-location>YUCETEPE MAHALLESI 85 CADDE NO 8, CANKAYA, 06570, TURKEY</pub-location><publisher>ANKARA HACI BAYRAM VELI UNIV</publisher><notes>exclusion criteria: language (Turkish)</notes><research-notes>exclusion criteria: language (Turkish)</research-notes><urls/><label>original text in Turkish</label><abstract>The politicization of bureaucracy, which indicates one of the most significant aspects of politics-bureaucracy relations, had been at the center of studies leading to the establishment of Public Administration Discipline, and has always maintained its importance and popularity as a subject matter since the beginning of the 20th century. Though it was used as a synonym of partisanship by Classical Approach, the politicization of bureaucracy, by virtue of Bureaucratic Politics Approach and Principle-Agent Approach that shed light on the different aspects of the politics-bureaucracy relations, gained two new meanings by the 1980s. While first meaning underlines harmony and complementarity between politics-bureaucracy, the second points a responsive and competent bureaucracy. Such a case, as it indicates one single signifier for three signifieds from the point of semiotics, has prevented us to demarcate an obvious distinction between different meanings of the concept. In order to ease analyzing and comprehending, this study, which aims to present three different meanings of the politicization of bureaucracy, claims that these different meanings can be examined via three types of antonyms in linguistics. While first meaning is related with complimentary antonym, second and third are matched with relational antonym and graded antonym respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iacoviello, Mercedes</author><author>Llano, Mercedes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trust over merit: the impact of presidential power concentration on public personnel management in Argentina [Confianza mata mérito: el impacto de la concentración de poder presidencial en la gestión de recursos humanos en el Estado argentino]</title><secondary-title>TEMAS Y DEBATES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>TEMAS Y DEBATES</full-title></periodical><pages>91-105</pages><issue>33</issue><keywords><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>politicization</keyword><keyword>public administration.</keyword><keyword>public bureaucracy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>RIOMBA \&amp; BERUTTI C U R, ROSARIO, 2000, ARGENTINA</pub-location><publisher>UNIV NAC ROSARIO, FAC CIENCIAS POLITICAS \&amp; RELACIONES INT</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://IACOVIELLO LLANO impacto de la concentración de poder presidencial Argentina 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Argentina</label><abstract>This paper analyzes the impact of centralization process of presidential political power during the last decade (2003-2015) on human resources management policies within the National Public Administration. This period of systematic concentration of powers in the hands of the president was accompanied by a progressive expansion of nomination capacities in order to guarantee the political adherence of the bureaucracy to the official project. The flexibilization of designations was the main resource used by governments to ensure political leadership over bureaucracy. The presidents mainly resorted to two appointment strategies to spread their margin of discretion: (1) the extension of the structure of transitional hiring outside the career system; and (2) the colonization of hierarchical positions through exception. The increasing use of these flexible mechanisms contributed to limit the full institutionalization of a professional bureaucracy, negatively affecting both the size of the state apparatus and government performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borges, André</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political and electoral dynamics, state bureaucracy and social spending</title><secondary-title>Caderno CRH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Caderno CRH</full-title></periodical><pages>91-109</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>58</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>elections</keyword><keyword>social spending</keyword><keyword>state government</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>EDUFBA - Editora Universttaria</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/s0103-49792010000100007</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BORGES Dinamica Burocracia Gasto Social Estadual 2010.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78049386816&amp;doi=10.1590%2Fs0103-49792010000100007&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f2c79e8eb57da1a0d51aca5844cb4969</url></web-urls></urls><label>Brazil;political appointments</label><abstract>This paper analyzes the effects of decentralization of authority and fiscal resources on processes and results of public policies.

It focuses on the political construction and renovation of state schools in Bahia over two terms (1999-2002 and 2003-2006). This paper concentrates on the impact of electoral and party politics over the allocation of investments in the Secretary of Education between the municipalities of the state, and also examines the role of appointments of senior positions in the sectorial bureaucracy in the construction of public policy. The analysis relies on a multimethod strategy, which combines multivariate statistical models and traditional techniques of case studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yazaki, Yukihiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of bureaucracy on political accountability and electoral selection</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Political Economy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Political Economy</full-title></periodical><pages>57-68</pages><volume>51</volume><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>electoral selection</keyword><keyword>political accountability</keyword><keyword>political appointment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2017.03.009</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://YAZAKI Effects of Bureaucracy on Political Accountability 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017382529&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.ejpoleco.2017.03.009&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4ea714d9f1c34c0db804a39cdbc400d4</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper examines how bureaucracy affects political accountability and electoral selection, using a three-tier political agency model consisting of voters, politicians and bureaucrats. In the model's hierarchy, politicians are constrained by elections while bureaucrats are controlled by budgets. If voters and bureaucrats prefer different types of politicians (i.e. they have a conflict of interests), incumbents pass oversized budgets to prevent bureaucrats from engaging in strategic behaviours that damage incumbents’ reputations. If, instead, voters and bureaucrats prefer the same type of politicians (i.e. they have an alignment of interests), bureaucrats cannot obtain a concession from politicians. In the latter case, however, bureaucrats send voters a credible signal regarding an incumbent's type, which improves electoral selection. This paper also shows that political appointment systems improve political accountability in the conflict-of-interests case while they weaken electoral selection in the alignment-of-interests case.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Diamond, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Core Executive Politics in the Cameron Era, 2010-16: The Dynamics of Whitehall Reform</title><secondary-title>Government and Opposition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Government and Opposition</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><keywords><keyword>UK politics</keyword><keyword>bureaucratic politics</keyword><keyword>core executive</keyword><keyword>governance</keyword><keyword>meta-governance</keyword><keyword>public policy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/gov.2021.47</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DIAMOND The Dynamics of Whitehall Reform 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119003501&amp;doi=10.1017%2Fgov.2021.47&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=61c599d1013c1e0bce71a1b46ecd1bb1</url></web-urls></urls><label>UK;political appointments</label><abstract>By the early 1990s, the core executive was established as the 'new orthodoxy' in the study of British government at the centre. Thirty years on, this article avers that its main assumptions are increasingly questionable in the light of more recent empirical evidence. The core executive approach may well have outlived its usefulness. This claim is derived from analysis of the Cameron premiership from 2010 to 2016. The focus is on how Whitehall reform radically altered the relationship between politicians and civil servants, reshaping prevailing public service bargains and rules of the game. Ministers identified mechanisms to rebuild political capacity, augmenting partisan control of the bureaucracy. They drew on resources from outside the core executive while politicians increased their sway over civil service appointments. As a result, officials felt they should be 'responsive' to ministers. The cumulative effect was to replace interpersonal and institutional resource dependency with a 'them and us' model. Consequently, the risk of policy disasters and fiascos grew.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dodds, G G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presidential Control of Independent Agencies’ Leadership and Personnel: A Two-Case Study of Interbranch Contestation over the Bureaucracy and the Unitary Executive under Donald Trump</title><secondary-title>Presidential Studies Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Presidential Studies Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>168-194</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley and Sons Inc</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/psq.12773</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DODDS Presidential Control of Independent Agencies  Leadership and Personnel  2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122859383&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fpsq.12773&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=38f92717144763b7a8313fa1d0f2f72d</url></web-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>This article assesses recent developments in the interbranch struggle over control of the bureaucracy, specifically independent federal agencies and the impact of the unitary executive theory during the presidency of Donald Trump.

In this study, we analyze the management of projects aiming to adapt to climate change in the period from 2009 to 2015. We are interested in two aspects: first, the overall bureaucratic setup of the adaptation regime, and second, the appointment of directors to the individual programs and what role foreign funding plays in making appointment decisions. With regard to the latter, it should be noted that project directors are an important arm of state bureaucracy in Bangladesh who guide the whole implementation and management of a development project, including its financial, regulatory, and informational dimensions. More specifically, we ask whether generalists or professionals are appointed as directors of the relevant projects. We argue and then show that the chances of appointing a professional as the director increase with the volume of foreign funding.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fiva, J H</author><author>Geys, B</author><author>Heggedal, T.-R.</author><author>Sørensen, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political Alignment and Bureaucratic Pay</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</full-title></periodical><pages>596-615</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jopart/muaa053</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 4</notes><research-notes>cited By 4</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://FIVA ET AL Political Alignment and Bureaucratic Pay 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102454760&amp;doi=10.1093%2Fjopart%2Fmuaa053&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e1d545bbac849c573d9f0377a45a4f00</url></web-urls></urls><label>Norway</label><abstract>Building on agency-theoretical perspectives of public bureaucracies, we argue that politician-bureaucrat preference alignment can have important implications for bureaucrats' pay. We study such private gains to bureaucrats from their political alignment with elected politicians using detailed data on all 1,632 top administrators active in all Norwegian municipalities over a period of 25 years (1991-2015). Whereas existing studies generally rely on proxies for politician-bureaucrat political alignment, a rare feature of our data allows measuring it directly since 27% of top bureaucrats ran for political office. We focus explicitly on individuals at the very top of the administrative hierarchy and are able to separate the intensive margin (i.e., wage increases) from any additional effects at the extensive margin (i.e., new appointments). Using close elections for inference in a regression discontinuity analysis, we find that politician-bureaucrat alignment significantly increases top bureaucrats' wage even in the Norwegian civil service system. This has important implications also from a theoretical perspective. Our results indeed go against predictions from models with policy-motivated bureaucrats, but are consistent with politically aligned principal-agent matches being more productive. © 2021 The Author(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Durant, Robert F.</author><author>Resh, William G.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Edwards, George C.</author><author>Howell, William G.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Presidential Agendas, Administrative Strategies, and the Bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>The Oxford Handbook of the American Presidency</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Oxford Handbook of the American Presidency</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Office of Management and Budget</keyword><keyword>White House</keyword><keyword>appointment powers</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>policy making</keyword><keyword>presidential agendas</keyword><keyword>reorganization tools</keyword><keyword>unilateral tools</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><isbn>9780191584855; 9780199238859</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0025</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 6</notes><research-notes>cited By 6</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DURAN RESH Presidential Agendas and the Bureaucracy US.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923826379&amp;doi=10.1093%2Foxfordhb%2F9780199238859.003.0025&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ee3561823960186223ab60519d72092c</url></web-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>This article identifies what is known, what is not known, and what needs to be studied to inform better both practice and theoretical debates over the efficacy of five major administrative tools: centralizing policy making in the White House, establishing regulatory clearance and program evaluation in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), reorganizing agencies, appointing loyalists to run them, and wielding unilateral tools.

It throws some light on tools of bureaucratic control that are associated with the fusion of legislative and executive powers in Britain's Westminster system. In contrast to the US, political control in the form of oversight or appointments is not required because government is able to intervene directly in bureaucratic activities through legislative, executive and administrative controls.

This study answers the question through conducting a case study of Tunisia. The study evaluates interview data recently collected among 39 municipalities in socio-economically divergent regions with mayors, city council members, civil society members, and a governor, and examines transparency data compiled for all 350 municipalities by an independent civil society organization. The findings suggest that partisanship appointment of governors can limit the inclusiveness of local governance through perpetuating hierarchical relations with mayors at the expense of inclusive local engagement mechanisms. An analysis on the Transparency Index of municipalities within governorates with identified partisanship ties (n = 206) indicates that municipal governance becomes less transparent when a governor shares a political background similar to the ideological position of the mayor’s party. Thus, partisan appointments of bureaucrats can have implications for the inclusiveness of local governance.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spence, David B.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Lee, Frances E.</author><author>McCarty, Nolan</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of partisan polarization on the bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>Can America Govern Itself?</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Can America Govern Itself?</full-title></periodical><pages>271-300</pages><keywords><keyword>administrative agencies</keyword><keyword>administrative law</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>bureaucratic politics</keyword><keyword>delegation</keyword><keyword>political control</keyword><keyword>regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><isbn>9781108667357</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/9781108667357.011</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2

Research suggests that despite a polarized Congress and a (somewhat) polarized electorate, agency policy choices do not seem to be moving systematically toward the extremes. Some combination of moderating effects seem to be at work, including the effect of divided government on appointments, agency preferences driven by moderate statutory mandates and/or the norms of issue networks, and (at times) the influence of ideologically moderate presidents on the size of the gridlock interval. The Trump administration may represent a departure from these norms: conservatives in the Trump coalition may be freer to pursue policies disfavored by a majority because of populist loyalty to the administration. Regardless, polarization-induced congressional gridlock poses ongoing challenges for the administrative state. Agencies must address problems within their jurisdiction in the absence of congressional input, using statutes that may have been poorly designed for the purpose. Courts will continue to struggle, case by case, with the implications for the constitutional legitimacy of agency policymaking.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saeki, Manabu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Appointing the fed chair: The political influence of presidential appointment on the Federal Reserve Board in the United States</title><secondary-title>Public Policy and Administration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Policy and Administration</full-title></periodical><pages>227-245</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Federal Reserve Board</keyword><keyword>monetary policy</keyword><keyword>presidential appointment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>SAGE Publications Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0952076708089974</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SAEKI Appointing the Chair 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-45849121330&amp;doi=10.1177%2F0952076708089974&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c2e47a39aa295524e4d8b30887acd8df</url></web-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Several scholars observe presidential appointment as a principal mechanism for the president to influence the bureaucracy in the United States. In order to study presidential influence on the Federal Reserve Board, which is widely considered to be one of the most independent governmental agencies, this article examines the influences of the Chairs and Governors of the Board appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents separately on monetary policy. The results show a significant impact of the presidential appointment of the Fed Chair, but not of the Governors. Also, when presidential popularity is declining, the serving president is likely to influence the Fed to stimulate the economy and improve his popular standing. However, this politically-motivated influence is present only under the Fed Chair appointed by the serving president, but not under the Chair appointed by the previous president.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cooper, Christopher A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The rise of court government?

A principle reason for the endurance of this debate is the absence of empirical indicators that can be compared over time. This article contributes to this research by examining a primary means the centre is believed to have increased its control: the appointment of administrative elites. Using an original data set of deputy minister turnover in Canada's provincial bureaucracies from 1920 to 2013, this article tests whether the relationship between a change in the first minister and bureaucratic mobility has shifted over time. Consistent with the centralisation of power thesis, the results show that the level of mobility following a transition in the first minister and party has increased since 1980. Moreover, whereas before 1980 only a change in first minister alongside a transition in party leads to increased mobility, since then, mobility increases alongside all newly elected first ministers, regardless of party change. This relationship is not found among unelected first ministers, who are believed to have a different relationship with cabinet and party members than elected first ministers.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olivieri, Cecília</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political controls over the bureaucracy [Os controles políticos sobre a burocracia*]</title><secondary-title>Revista de Administracao Publica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Revista de Administracao Publica</full-title></periodical><pages>1395-1424</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>democratic controls</keyword><keyword>political control over bureaucracy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/S0034-76122011000500007</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 9</notes><research-notes>cited By 9</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://OLIVIERI Controles Políticos Burocracia 2011.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053316425&amp;doi=10.1590%2FS0034-76122011000500007&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=89977a5ee5b9f33e7415b33d6e0c0e09</url></web-urls></urls><label>Brazil;US</label><abstract>The article reviews the literature on the themes of the relationship between politics and bureaucracy and democratic control over the bureaucracy by analyzing three sets of works: Weber's production on the relationship between government and bureaucracy, the North American literature and national production. Weber's work allows us to establish with precision the central features of modern bureaucracy, its role in contemporary democratic government and the need for political control over bureaucracy. The debate in the U.S., in turn, explains the absence, in Brazil, the discussion on the relationship between politics and bureaucracy in a democratic perspective. Despite this absence, we analyze the contemporary literature in order to describe the present situation of the controls on the bureaucracy in Brazil and understand, even in incipient way, the mechanics of control, in particular the appointment, the budget, legislation and monitoring.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Remington, Thomas F.</author><author>Yakovlev, Andrei A.</author><author>Ovchinnikova, Elena</author><author>Chasovsky, Alexander</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Career trajectories of regional officials: Russia and China before and after 2012</title><secondary-title>Eurasian Geography and Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eurasian Geography and Economics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Russia</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy under authoritarian government</keyword><keyword>career mobility</keyword><keyword>regional officials</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Routledge</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15387216.2021.1944247</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://REMINGTON Career Trajectories of Regional Officers China Russia 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109039963&amp;doi=10.1080%2F15387216.2021.1944247&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b83d0877e26368f6ccec4afafcf335d1</url></web-urls></urls><label>China;Russia;political appointments</label><abstract>Authoritarian leaders rely on regional leaders for both political support and the fulfillment of their policy objectives. In addition, top leaders face trade-offs between following established rules for managing bureaucratic officials’ careers and exercising a free hand in choosing regional officials. This paper compares patterns of appointment of regional officials in Russia and China before and after 2012. In recent years, the leaders of both countries have centralized and personalized state power. We hypothesize that these changes have altered policies for managing the appointments of regional leaders in such a way as to increase their dependence on the central authorities and reduce their autonomy to create their own networks at the regional level. We analyze a comprehensive original set of biographical data on all top regional officials from 2003 through 2019 in China and from 2000 through 2019 in Russia. We discern clear differences between the pre- and post-2012 period for China and less marked differences for pre- and post-2012 Russia. Turnover of regional officials has become more frequent in both systems; average tenure in office has fallen; and the share of “outsiders” has risen. However, the corps of regional officials has not been rejuvenated.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bustikova, Lenka</author><author>Corduneanu-Huci, Cristina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Patronage, trust, and state capacity: The historical trajectories of clientelism</title><secondary-title>World Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>277-326</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0043887116000265</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 28</notes><research-notes>cited By 28</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BUSTIKOVA CORDUNEANU HOCI Patronage and Trust 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014544147&amp;doi=10.1017%2FS0043887116000265&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=177e243b44a8051752a6ab754677ec13</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>What explains different levels of clientelism across countries? Why do some politicians deliver clientelistic goods to their electoral constituencies, and why do some voters demand them? This article focuses on the historical origins of trust in states and shows that they have a lasting impact on contemporary patterns of patronage. The shift to programmatic politics reflects a historical transition from personalized trust in politicians to trust in impersonal bureaucracies tasked by political parties to implement policy. Past experience with public bureaucracy informs the expectations of voters and parties regarding the performance of the state and its ability to provide public goods, which in turn shape the degree of clientelistic exchange across societies. To capture state capacity, the authors focus on the critical juncture before the expansion of women's suffrage, and use the ability of public bureaucracies to reduce infant mortality in the interwar period as a proxy for historical state capacity and as an instrument to predict trust. Macrodata from eightyeight electoral democracies and microdata from the most recent wave of the World Value Survey provide supportive evidence for the theory.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Acemoglu, Daron</author><author>Ticchi, Davide</author><author>Vindigni, Andrea</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emergence and persistence of inefficient states</title><secondary-title>Journal of the European Economic Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the European Economic Association</full-title></periodical><pages>177-208</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.01008.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 120</notes><research-notes>cited By 120</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ACEMOGLU ET AL Inefficient States 2011.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952666120&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fj.1542-4774.2010.01008.x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=731685179ea0f90e7124836dbcb9fb23</url></web-urls></urls><label>patronage</label><abstract>We present a theory of the emergence and persistence of inefficient states based on patronage politics. The society consists of rich and poor. The rich are initially in power, but expect to transition to democracy, which will choose redistributive policies. Taxation requires the employment of bureaucrats. By choosing an inefficient state structure, the rich may be able to use patronage and capture democratic politics, so reducing the amount of redistribution in democracy. Moreover, the inefficient state creates its own constituency and tends to persist over time. Intuitively, an inefficient state structure creates more rents for bureaucrats than would an efficient one. When the poor come to power in democracy, they will reform the structure of the state to make it more efficient so that higher taxes can be collected at lower cost and with lower rents for bureaucrats. Anticipating this, when the society starts out with an inefficient organization of the state, bureaucrats support the rich, who set lower taxes but also provide rents to bureaucrats. We obtain that the rich-bureaucrats coalition may also expand the size of bureaucracy excessively so as to generate enough political support. The model shows that an equilibrium with an inefficient state is more likely to arise when there is greater income inequality, when bureaucratic rents take intermediate values, and when individuals are sufficiently forward-looking.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schuster, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Patrons against clients: Electoral uncertainty and bureaucratic tenure in politicized states</title><secondary-title>Regulation and Governance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Regulation and Governance</full-title></periodical><pages>26-43</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>civil service reform</keyword><keyword>electoral competition</keyword><keyword>institutional reform</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>tenure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Blackwell Publishing</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/rego.12186</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SCHUSTER Electoral Uncertainty and Bureaucratic Tenure 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042660427&amp;doi=10.1111%2Frego.12186&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7fa9d8867711f828a48e4a247e6bb50a</url></web-urls></urls><label>Dominican Republic</label><abstract>Why would incumbents undertake institutional reforms that constrain their discretion over state resources? Many studies point to electoral competition in response. They argue that incumbents who risk exit from office undertake reform to insure themselves against potentially hostile successors. This paper challenges this line of reasoning, arguing that it confounds two potential implications of electoral competition – potential and certain electoral losses – which yield contrary reform incentives. Certain exits from office may well incentivize reforms as insurance. Where elections are contested, however, incumbents face incentives to resist reforms that constrain discretion over state resources that provide incumbents with electoral advantage. This argument is developed and assessed with an institutional reform the literature has so far neglected: job stability protections (tenure) in politicized bureaucracies. A case analysis of the Dominican Republic and suggestive cross-country data confirm theoretical predictions: electoral uncertainty dis-incentivizes tenure reform. Electoral competition may thus be a double-edged sword for institutional reform.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyer-Sahling, Jan-Hinrik</author><author>Jager, Krisztina</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Kopecký, Petr</author><author>Mair, Peter</author><author>Spirova, Maria</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Party Patronage in Hungary: Capturing the State</title><secondary-title>Party Patronage and Party Government in European Democracies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Party Patronage and Party Government in European Democracies</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>Oxford</pub-location><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><isbn>9780191741517; 9780199599370</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199599370.003.0009</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 10

It argues that party patronage reaches into all areas of the public sector. Political appointments are relatively more important for the ministerial bureaucracy than for executive agencies and executing institutions such as state-owned enterprises. They are more common at the top of institutions, predominantly for the sake of politically controlling the policy process. The chapter shows that party patronage varies across sectors. Three patterns are distinguished. They are labelled as 'captured sectors' such as the Media, 'partially disciplined sectors' such as Finance and Economy, and 'partially insulated sectors' such as the Judiciary. The chapter concludes that party patronage contributes to the stabilization of parties and party systems in Hungary. Yet patronage increases corruption risks in the public sector, breeds popular distrust in political parties, and hence runs the risk of being self-defeating for the parties that rely on it. © Petr Kopeckỳ, the estate of Petr Mair, and Maria Spirova 2012.

The evidence presented indicates that meritbased appointments are indeed a large part of the story. It is not the only one, however. In fact, the results indicate that a fairly sharp line can be drawn between the civil service on the one hand, and executing institutions and auxiliary institutions, such as councils and committees, on the other. In the former, the minister's role is circumscribed and influence appears to be exercised on professional rather than political terms. In the latter, some sectors present a more blurry picture, as political motives blend with professional criteria without replacing them. Moreover, it is notable that politics is most evident in appointments to auxiliary institutions. Finally, potential historical and institutional explanations for the existing balance between parties and the state in Denmark are discussed. © Petr Kopeckỳ, the estate of Petr Mair, and Maria Spirova 2012.

Administrative reform came in the wake of the constitutional reform that transformed unitary Belgium into a federal state with several governments, each with a civil service of its own. The fiscal crisis prompted them to look favorably on the promises of New Public Management (NPM). The new Flemish government was first to take advantage of this opportunity, as it had the financial resources, the tendency to refer to Anglo-Saxon and Dutch examples, and the right political and administrative leadership. The staying power of these as yet precarious reforms depends on the continuity of political leadership, the establishment of an administrative culture matching the institutional innovations, and resistance to the endemic temptation to use them for partisan purposes.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lopez, Félix G.</author><author>Silva, Thiago Moreira da</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Bureaucratic Carousel of Positions of Trust: Analysis of Survival in the Management Positions of the Brazilian Federal Executive (1999-2017) [Le Carrousel bureaucratique des postes de confiance: Analyse de survie dans les postes de direction (DAS) de</title><secondary-title>Dados</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dados</full-title></periodical><volume>65</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>federal bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>positions of trust</keyword><keyword>survival analysis</keyword><keyword>turnover</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Politicos (IESP), UERJ</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/dados.2022.65.2.263</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LOPEZ MOREIRA O Carrossel Burocrático 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125104912&amp;doi=10.1590%2Fdados.2022.65.2.263&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3d1de9ba96cb4813c0be3b0393be47f7</url></web-urls></urls><label>Brazil</label><abstract>We analyzed the length of stay of the nominees for Senior Management and Advi-sory (in the acronym in Portuguese, DAS) positions in the Brazilian Federal Executive, from 1999 to 2017. The median duration in this type of position is 25 months and, at the top bureaucratic level, 23 months. About 30% of the nominees do not complete their first year of work and less than 30% of them remain in the same position for an entire presidential term. Factors such as the stability of ministers, affiliation to parties, belonging to federal careers, and place of work influence the chances of permanence of the nominees. The results contribute to unraveling the Brazilian Federal Executive’s working logic and its relationship with federative and party organizations.

The Politics of Presidential Appointments examines in depth how and why presidents use political appointees and how their choices impact government performance--for better or worse. One way presidents can influence the permanent bureaucracy is by filling key posts with people who are sympathetic to their policy goals. But if the president's appointees lack competence and an agency fails in its mission--as with Katrina--the president is accused of employing his friends and allies to the detriment of the public. Through case studies and cutting-edge analysis, David Lewis takes a fascinating look at presidential appointments dating back to the 1960s to learn which jobs went to appointees, which agencies were more likely to have appointees, how the use of appointees varied by administration, and how it affected agency performance. He argues that presidents politicize even when it hurts performance--and often with support from Congress--because they need agencies to be responsive to presidential direction. He shows how agency missions and personnel--and whether they line up with the president's vision--determine which agencies presidents target with appointees, and he sheds new light on the important role patronage plays in appointment decisions. © 2008 by Princeton University Press.

Normatively, it is suggested that it is simply unfair for white, middle-aged males to dominate decision-making structures. Instead it has been argued that representative diversity can enhance the legitimacy of political institutions and processes, whilst improving the quality and inclusivity of policy-making. Although most of these arguments have been applied to elected institutions and their bureaucracies, they are also germane in the context of appointments to the boards of public bodies, as the work of these bodies and the decisions made by their board members impacts upon the everyday lives of citizens. Drawing upon original research conducted in the UK, this article argues that the capacity of political actors to make appointments to public boards offers an as yet unrealized democratic potential by offering more opportunities for social engagement and participation in public governance. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lopez, Félix G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Politics and bureaucracy in Indian and Brazilian state [Política e burocracia nos estados da Índia e do Brasil]</title><secondary-title>Revista de Sociologia e Politica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Revista de Sociologia e Politica</full-title></periodical><pages>69-92</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>SUPPL.</issue><keywords><keyword>Brazil</keyword><keyword>India</keyword><keyword>high</keyword><keyword>level positions</keyword><keyword>nominations</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>political system</keyword><keyword>public administration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>Universidade Federal do Parana</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/s0104-44782008000300006</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LOPEZ Política e Burocracia India Brasil 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58449109806&amp;doi=10.1590%2Fs0104-44782008000300006&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6c1ebc93ae72a1dc3052f12983943952</url></web-urls></urls><label>Brazil;India;political appointments</label><abstract>This text provides a brief presentation of the Indian political system, analyzing the genesis and development of the civil servant transfer system within Indian public administration and how this interacts with the social system, the political sphere and with parliament members' political and electoral interests. This is followed by several comparisons that are established between the characteristics of the relationship between the political and administrative spheres in India and those of the system for naming people for high level positions in Brazil, taking Rio de Janeiro as our example. We argue that both the logic of the transfer system in India and the system through which people are named for high level positions in Brazil maintain legitimacy insofar as they allow ideas linked to administrative efficiency and combating corruption to be used in justifying decisions that are often motivated by political, economic and electoral interests. We also argue that analyses of the relationship between politics and public administration in both countries should not only take the design of political and electoral institutions and the postulate of electoral rationality into account but also the values that were developed throughout the process in which political institutions and public bureaucracies were constituted.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harris, Adam S.</author><author>Sigman, Rachel</author><author>Meyer-Sahling, Jan-Hinrik</author><author>Mikkelsen, Kim Sass</author><author>Schuster, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oiling the bureaucracy? political spending, bureaucrats and the resource curse</title><secondary-title>World Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World Development</full-title></periodical><volume>127</volume><keywords><keyword>Ghana</keyword><keyword>Uganda</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>economic development</keyword><keyword>literature review</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104745</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 9</notes><research-notes>cited By 9</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HARRIS ET AL Poltiical Spending and Bureaucrats 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075956300&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.worlddev.2019.104745&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=381e5ede3e679e1e3e2389afe94fee82</url></web-urls></urls><label>Ghana;Uganda</label><abstract>What role do bureaucrats play in the development of the resource curse in countries that have recently discovered oil? Much of the resource curse literature argues that political leaders spend natural resource revenue in ways that entrench their political power but undermine longer-term economic development. This literature has largely overlooked the role of bureaucrats – those responsible for the day-to-day operations of the state. Bureaucrats may support or constrain political spending in ways that minimize the resource curse. Using results of a survey experiment with over 3000 government employees in Ghana and Uganda, two countries with recent oil and gas discoveries, we find that bureaucrats treated with information on oil revenue are more likely to disapprove of spending practices that benefit political supporters. The results also suggest that material motivations may be at play: bureaucrats in Uganda who are secure in their jobs and outside of government patronage networks are most likely to oppose the political use of oil revenue. These findings challenge unitary state assumptions underlying much of the resource curse literature, especially for new oil producers. They also suggest that policymakers ought to engage civil servants in efforts to avoid or curtail the resource curse.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Colonnelli, Emanuele</author><author>Prem, Mounu</author><author>Teso, Edoardo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Patronage and selection in public sector organizations</title><secondary-title>American Economic Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Economic Review</full-title></periodical><pages>3071-3099</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>American Economic Association</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1257/aer.20181491</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 28</notes><research-notes>cited By 28</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://COLONNELLI ET AL Patronage in the Public Sector Brazil 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088114916&amp;doi=10.1257%2Faer.20181491&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2a8585b09ee582cd785a0b16b47360f6</url></web-urls></urls><label>patronage</label><abstract>In all modern bureaucracies, politicians retain some discretion in public employment decisions, which may lead to frictions in the selection process if political connections substitute for individual competence. Relying on detailed matched employer- employee data on the universe of public employees in Brazil over 1997-2014, and on a regression discontinuity design in close electoral races, we establish three main findings. First, political connections are a key and quantitatively large determinant of employment in public organizations, for both bureaucrats and frontline providers. Second, patronage is an important mechanism behind this result. Third, political considerations lead to the selection of less competent individuals.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schuster, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>WHAT CAUSES PATRONAGE REFORM?

Patronage provides many incumbents with governability and electoral advantage. What causes governments to forsake patronage in favour of civil service reform? This article reviews scholarly explanations. It finds that studies usefully identify diverse socioeconomic and political-institutional factors which can affect reform incentives. The causal effects of these factors – their weight, mechanisms and signs – are contested, however. This article partially resolves this contestation by considering which reform studies explain: different bureaucratic structures develop asynchronously and feature different determinants. To illustrate, political competition is argued to incentivize reform to ‘blanket in’ party appointees; or do the opposite by reducing expectations to reap longer-term state capacity benefits. Yet, ‘blanketing in’ necessitates bureaucratic job stability, while state capacity requires merit recruitment of skilled bureaucrats – two poorly correlated reforms. The causes of patronage reform thus depend on the type of civil service reform. © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ujhelyi, Gergely</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Civil service rules and policy choices: Evidence from US State Governments</title><secondary-title>American Economic Journal: Economic Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Economic Journal: Economic Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>338-380</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>American Economic Association</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1257/pol.6.2.338</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 18</notes><research-notes>cited By 18</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://UJHELYI Civil Service Rules and Policy Choices 2014.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84900471864&amp;doi=10.1257%2Fpol.6.2.338&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7ac34a3239e1001a3f8eef4c2e9935bb</url></web-urls></urls><label>US;local politics</label><abstract>This paper studies the policy impact of civil service regulations, exploiting reforms undertaken by US state governments throughout the twentieth century.

By triangulating quantitative and qualitative survey data from a sample of Chinese cadres (n=286), the authors aim to answer the research question: ‘What is the behavioral impact of the incentive structure the cadre management system helps to shape, and does the incentive matrix support a meritocratic work environment?'. The findings demonstrate that the promotion of local leading cadres is primarily based on their superiors’ recognition and appreciation. A principal-component analysis reveals that what impresses the superiors includes both patronage and merit factors, although patronage has a slight edge over merit. This study also suggests that good interpersonal skills are essential for both merit- and patronageoriented career advancement.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vittoria, Armando; Alfano, Vincenzo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Central bureaucracy and particracy in Italy: What role for political patronage?

This approach, albeit slow and occasionally cumbersome, is generally assumed to be the most meritocratic method of recruitment. However, while some applicants may have skills suited for a specific position, they may not perform best in a general examination. As long as the system is not abused, a more flexible recruitment process based on, for example, interviews and CV screening, may be more meritocratic. It is therefore necessary to weigh the risk of abuse against the potential gains from more flexibility. Formal civil service examinations are hypothesized in this article to be the most meritocratic way to recruit civil servants only in countries where the risk for patronage is high. Analysis of a dataset describing the structures and characteristics of bureaucracies worldwide lends support to the hypothesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Feeney, Mary K.</author><author>Kingsley, Gordon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Rebirth of Patronage: Have We Come Full Circle?</title><secondary-title>Public Integrity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Integrity</full-title></periodical><pages>165-176</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>Taylor and Francis Ltd.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2753/PIN1099-9922100205</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 15</notes><research-notes>cited By 15</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://FEENEY KINGSLEY The Rebirth of Patronage US 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050713067&amp;doi=10.2753%2FPIN1099-9922100205&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fdc78809f58f35ccf554731c1b5756d3</url></web-urls></urls><label>US;patronage</label><abstract>Current trends in the U.S. political system threaten an increase in patronage and a return to the political problems of the 1800s. Modern-day patronage is strongly related to two popular efforts to reform government: the rollback of the civil service system and the privatization of government services. These reforms, aimed at reducing the negative outcomes of bureaucracy, have had the unfortunate outcome of eliminating policies designed to protect civil servants from patronage politics and thus of ultimately reducing democratic accountability. Whether the main cause is forgetfulness about the past or simply the application of misguided principles, the dismantling of the civil service and increasing reliance on private contractors can endanger public values and the ability to engage in a thoughtful debate about public values. Professionalism in government—including civil service, open competition for jobs and contracts, and merit systems—remains the most effective and just means for combating patronage and identifying talented, dedicated public servants and contractors.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Polga-Hecimovich, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Bureaucratic Perils of Presidentialism: Political Impediments to Good Governance in Latin America</title><secondary-title>Korean Journal of Policy Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Korean Journal of Policy Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Latin America</keyword><keyword>governance</keyword><keyword>policy failure</keyword><keyword>presidentialism</keyword><keyword>public administration</keyword><keyword>public policy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Seoul National University - Graduate School of Public Administration</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.52372/kjps36401</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://POLGA HECIMOVICH The Bureaucratic Perils of Presidentialism 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122913822&amp;doi=10.52372%2Fkjps36401&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3f3063533e82b5fe35ff02768e83f758</url></web-urls></urls><label>Latin America;political institutions</label><abstract>In the face of poorly performing bureaucracies, public management specialists and policy experts have been quick to suggest administrative reforms. Yet, since governance lies at the nexus of politics and administration, reforms limited to the administrative dimension are likely to fall short without concomitant political change. This essay argues that in contemporary Latin America, certain political-institutional arrangements or institutional traits are more likely to produce (in)effective governance than others. Specifically, Latin American presidentialism creates several “perils” for governance, including: the rigidity and short time horizons of presidentialism; multipartyism under presidentialism; weakly institutionalized party systems and non-programmatic parties; an imbalance of power between strong presidents and weak legislatures; the plebiscitarian nature of presidentialism; and democratic backsliding and the centralization of power in the presidency. These institutional traits incentivize patronage, promote myopic policymaking, and weaken bureaucratic autonomy. To illustrate how they manifest themselves in public policy, the paper uses evidence from the region’s responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, then concludes by suggesting political reforms that may help to improve governance in the region.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ngusmanto, Ngusmanto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pilkada 2015 and patronage practice among bureaucrat in West Kalimantan, Indonesia</title><secondary-title>Asian Social Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Asian Social Science</full-title></periodical><pages>236-243</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Indonesia</keyword><keyword>West Kalimantan</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>pilkada</keyword><keyword>politician-bureaucrat nexus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Canadian Center of Science and Education</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5539/ass.v12n9p236</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NGUSMANTO Patronage in Indonesia 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988001675&amp;doi=10.5539%2Fass.v12n9p236&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=09cd166bea579704552dbfb8ba2e8f6e</url></web-urls></urls><label>Indonesia;local politics</label><abstract>Majority studies on electoral dynamics in Indonesia are reinforce patronage as a pattern of relationships between candidates, winning team, and voters. One of winning team element which have little attention from scholars is bureaucrat. Although, normatively, bureaucrats are required to neutral in all type of general election, but in fact bureaucrats is very involved deeply in general elections. Based on empirical research in Sintang District and Ketapang District, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, we found that bureaucrats have a significant role as a winning team in pilkada (direct election for local leader). Patronage is a keyword to explain political relation between bureaucrats and candidate in pilkada. This situation was triggered by the fact that there are many candidates who have social background as civil servant and, consequently, have direct access to bureaucracy. Bureaucrats have high motivation to participate in pilkada as a broker due to protecting their vested interest. In our cases, the vested interest of bureaucrat is career stability which is promising additional personal revenue and social status. Consequently, staffing (circulation of position) within bureaucracy does not followed by auction mechanism (merit system), but following nepotism mechanism (spoil system). The winner of pilkada is socially pressured to accommodate all bureaucrats who has become their winning team.

Italian public administration is normally characterized as badly designed and inefficient, and government performance is usually classed as poor. I argue by contrast that bureaucratic inefficiency, excessive legislation and widespread bureaucratic corruption were features of Italian public administration that were deliberately designed by legislators and intended to enhance the re-election prospects for incumbents by providing them with opportunities for extensive constituency service. The underlying incentives stemmed from the candidates' search for the personal vote, essential for retaining public office. Differences in the laws regulating the financing of political campaigns explain why excessive bureaucratization in the Italian context also resulted in extensive political corruption.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCourt, Willy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Policy arena: Impartiality through bureaucracy?

The article concludes that values-based management is likeliest to succeed in the public sector, whose democratic legitimacy allows politicians to impose values in the form of behavioural norms.

We develop a dynamic model of personnel policy, bureaucratic quality, and electoral competition. In each period, incumbents choose how much to support patronage and civil service personnel systems. The civil service system is needed to produce public goods, but patronage provides private goods and improves an incumbent’s reelection prospects. Incumbents must also worry about whether opponents will sustain the civil service system following an electoral loss. Our results demonstrate the importance of a cross-party commitment to public goods, along with low costs of civil service hiring, for encouraging good government in equilibrium. The model also suggests that electoral competitiveness has only a limited influence on good government and challenges previous arguments about electoral vulnerability and civil service reform. We finally present empirical evidence regarding our predicted relationship between party system convergence and merit-based hiring.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aremu, Fatai Ayinde</author><author>Adedire, Solomon Adebayo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bureaucracy, bureaucratic politics, and the policy establishment</title><secondary-title>Advances in African Economic, Social and Political Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in African Economic, Social and Political Development</full-title></periodical><pages>217-232</pages><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>hallmark</keyword><keyword>kaleidoscopic</keyword><keyword>policy</keyword><keyword>politics</keyword><keyword>reforms</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Springer Nature</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-030-50509-7_10</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0

The study presents an overview of the bureaucracy, reviews its evolution, its reforms and transformations as well as engages the salient issues that dominate the discourses on the bureaucracy. Relying on secondary sources of data such as textbooks, journals, official documents, reports, and a discourse analysis, this chapter argues that impartiality, anonymity, and political neutrality are hallmark of bureaucracy, which allows it to function effectively without being encumbered by the vicissitudes of the kaleidoscopic political environment. The finding was that the Nigerian bureaucratic establishment exerts tremendous strain on public overhead expenditure to the detriment of investment in capital project and infrastructure. Rather than draw down the size of the bureaucracy, successive administrations have continued to grow the service as a result of desire to grant political patronage to supporters and acolytes. Considering the endemic corruption that permeates civil service and the entrenched culture of nepotism, this chapter proposes that Nigerian bureaucratic establishment requires much deeper restructuring and a change of mentality and attitude to work than the periodic peripheral reforms seem to offer.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nunes, Rodrigo M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The politics of sentencing reform in Brazil: Autonomous bureaucrats, constrained politicians and gradual policy change</title><secondary-title>Journal of Latin American Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Latin American Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>121-148</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Brazil</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>drug policy</keyword><keyword>prison overcrowding</keyword><keyword>sentencing reform</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0022216X14001060</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 4</notes><research-notes>cited By 4</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NUNES Autonomous Bureaucrats Gradual Change Prison Reform 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921439077&amp;doi=10.1017%2FS0022216X14001060&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9d80851084194c10a46e59c96416285e</url></web-urls></urls><label>Brazil</label><abstract>Popular attitudes towards crime in Latin America induce local legislators to support harsh sentencing frameworks.

Insulated from patronage networks and granted broad mandates to pursue solutions to pressing penal crises, these policy elites use their position in the state to develop new rules and facilitate their approval despite popular opposition to measures that limit the state's punitive capacity.

Despite its prevalence, this perspective does not account for the services that job recipients frequently provide to their political principals beyond the one-time exchange of political support. Drawing on extensive data from Benin and Ghana, including a comprehensive database of minister biographies, surveys of bureaucrats, administrative data, and elite interviews, this article argues that leaders distribute and manage state jobs in ways that enable them to extract and control state money for political financing. Whether incumbent leaders extract state resources themselves, delegate to elite party agents, or co-opt and coerce bureaucrats to divert money to the party shapes which jobs they distribute politically and to whom. The findings suggest that jobs are substantively different from other currencies of clientelistic exchange. © The Author(s) 2021.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alba, Carlos R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bureaucratic politics in Spain: A long-lasting tradition</title><secondary-title>Politicians, Bureaucrats and Administrative Reform</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Politicians, Bureaucrats and Administrative Reform</full-title></periodical><pages>89-100</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>Taylor and Francis</publisher><isbn>9781134566556; 0203391500; 9780415234436</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4324/9780203391501-18</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1

It has been nothing more than a continuous effort to recreate ex nihilo a homogeneous public service at the European level. The Spanish tradition of instability, of permanent conflict between political factions, of the selling of public jobs and, finally, our typical ‘spoils system’, were not the best foundations for the establishment of a professional modern civil service. On the other hand, the public employees affected by the spoils system were always a group interested in the fall of the government, which had been the cause of their spoil retirement, and this situation certainly did not contribute to political stability. Favouritism and patronage were the principal means of recruiting and organising the civil service and political class. In these circumstances of instability and protectionism, some civil servants monopolised the exercise of the authority of the state, including fundamental public tasks such as the budget, tax policy or public works. This situation of monopoly was intimately connected with the knowledge and experience that only these public officials had, which enabled them to enjoy stability against the instability of the other public officials and also to achieve an ius singulare as a legal base of their situation. This circumstance made it possible for certain groups of public officials, due to their professional competence, their political affiliations, the importance of their functions and their group solidarity, to create special corps, from which some became powerful members of the political class, crystallising into an elite structure which has remained until now.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Making Bureaucracy Work: Patronage Networks, Performance Incentives, and Economic Development in China</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Political Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Political Science</full-title></periodical><pages>982-999</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/ajps.12394</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 68</notes><research-notes>cited By 68</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://JIANG Making Bureaucracy Work  Patronage Networks China 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053505903&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fajps.12394&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d19bb1a9ce5b227cdd8939cb9570bc22</url></web-urls></urls><label>China</label><abstract>Patron–client networks are widely found in governments of transitional societies and are often seen as an impediment to effective governance.

I substantiate this claim by examining how patronage networks shape economic performance of local governments in China. Using an original city–level panel data set between 2000 and 2011, and a new method that identifies patronage ties based on past promotions, I show that city leaders with informal ties to the incumbent provincial leaders deliver significantly faster economic growth than those without.

Scholars have long focused on cabinet appointments to understand how executives build coalitions with their legislative allies. In many democracies, however, cabinet appointments at the ministerial level may only represent the tip of the iceberg. We show that administrative political appointees (APAs) beneath the ministerial level constitute one of the most important ways that cooperation between legislative and executive is forged. Leveraging a unique and comprehensive database of an average 2600 Brazilian APAs per year over two decades, we evaluate their effect on coalition unity in critical legislative votes. We demonstrate that these APAs, which we collectively term the “patronage coalition,” have a significant effect on legislative support and thus are a critical tool for presidents. Our results are particularly relevant to a new emphasis in the political science literature on the “toolbox” that presidents utilize to address the challenges of simultaneously maintaining legislative support while implementing policy. These results demonstrate that the patronage coalition is a fundamental tool that should be more widely integrated into models of legislative-executive bargaining. © The Author(s) 2022.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gera, Weena</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The politics of ethnic representation in Philippine bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>Ethnic and Racial Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ethnic and Racial Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>858-877</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Politics of ethnic representation</keyword><keyword>asymmetric autonomy</keyword><keyword>ethnic representation in bureaucratic governance</keyword><keyword>political</keyword><keyword>reallocation of space</keyword><keyword>representative bureaucracy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Routledge</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01419870.2015.1080374</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GERA The Politics of Ethnic Representationin Philippine Bureaucracy 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941711720&amp;doi=10.1080%2F01419870.2015.1080374&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=adc0d6dd26b55c9d1f6d89aa7fdd3b15</url></web-urls></urls><label>Philippines;patronage;representative bureaucracy</label><abstract>The good governance argument for diversity in civil service is based on the notion that creating a bureaucracy that represents the diverse communities it serves strengthens government accountability and legitimacy. This paper argues that ethnic representation in national bureaucratic governance in the Philippines primarily constitutes a means for political reallocation of space, as it is embedded in the government’s framework of asymmetric political autonomy. Mired in intersecting political and ethnic tensions (i.e. blurred ethnic distinctions/ethnic identity disputes and politico-ethnic conflicts), patrimonial forces could easily exploit the country’s bureaucratic representation policies as spaces for patronage and as superficial tokens to mollify interethnic factions of their share of the national polity. Thus, instead of facilitating equitable voice in bureaucratic governance, such policy framework could only hold ordinary indigenous and minority ethnic communities captive in the elite-dominated interethnic struggle for representation.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brass, J N</author><author>Schon, J</author><author>Baldwin, E</author><author>MacLean, L M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial analysis of bureaucrats’ attempts to resist political capture in a developing democracy: The distribution of solar panels in Ghana</title><secondary-title>Political Geography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Political Geography</full-title></periodical><volume>76</volume><keywords><keyword>Geographically weighted regression (GWR)</keyword><keyword>bureaucrats</keyword><keyword>civil servants</keyword><keyword>distributive politics</keyword><keyword>political capture</keyword><keyword>voter mobilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.polgeo.2019.102087</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 6</notes><research-notes>cited By 6</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BRASS ET AL Bureaucratic Capture Ghana 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073187565&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.polgeo.2019.102087&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a7abbaea90f79d94a97d4a3b42e3bac0</url></web-urls></urls><label>Ghana</label><abstract>Can civil servants in a developing democracy successfully resist political capture in the distribution of public goods? Existing research tends to highlight political patronage logics of distribution, and scholarship focuses primarily on politicians’ motivations. But service decisions are often made by bureaucrats, who sometimes explicitly try to avoid capture and allocate on the basis of need. Using qualitative interviews and spatial regressions with geo-coded data from a solar panel program in Ghana, we examine such a situation. We show that, despite considerable efforts to thwart it, national-level civil servants were unable to fully resist political capture. While solar panel distribution partially corresponded to need for electricity, we find that panels also went to areas where voter turnout was historically inconsistent, likely to motivate voter turnout. The direction of these relationships was consistent across subnational space, but the magnitudes varied considerably and were strongest in districts adjacent to Lake Volta. Qualitative data analysis reveals that this subnational variation reflects the logistics of space and the historical politics of place. The article contributes to theories of distributive politics and of voting behavior, and highlights the need for subnational disaggregation across space. © 2019</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mueller, Hannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Insulation or patronage: Political institutions and bureaucratic efficiency</title><secondary-title>B.E.

Political influence can harm competence because it lowers the incentives of bureaucrats to invest in competence. Politicians then want to adopt institutions that insulate the bureaucracy because this establishes a commitment to reward competence. Political leaders insulate the bureaucracy if public good provision is important compared to rent extraction or when political competition forces the political elite to internalize the welfare loss caused by patronage. Through this channel political reforms can lead to reforms of the bureaucracy. The theoretical findings are illustrated with existing empirical studies and data on central bank independence.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hodder, Rupert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What’s Wrong with Patronage?</title><secondary-title>Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Society</full-title></periodical><pages>166-173</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>corrruption</keyword><keyword>democracy</keyword><keyword>government</keyword><keyword>organizations</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>social relationships</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Springer New York LLC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12115-015-9878-2</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HODDER Whats wrong with patronage 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939994423&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12115-015-9878-2&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f95e7e380be94316296bd5af2a2e6dfb</url></web-urls></urls><label>patronage</label><abstract>Patronage is treated as a discrete phenomenon through which political, bureaucratic, and wider social behaviour may be analysed and explained. As such, it is commonly seen as an obstacle to (or as a stopgap for) effective administration; as a feature that is in some respects compatible with (and may aid) democracy; and as behaviour that is quite simply different from practice within Weberian bureaucracies. I wish to point this debate along a slightly different path. I suggest that a more nuanced approach (and one closer to everyday experience) is yielded when patronage is recognized as an aspect of social relationships. Viewed in this light, there is more than enough material in the existing literature to reveal a link between patronage, formal organizations and democracy. I then go on to discuss briefly why relationships modulate such that certain aspects are brought to the fore; and to consider the implications of this explanation for existing views on patronage and the genesis of organizations and democratic patterns.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Silva, Patrícia</author><author>Jalali, Carlos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Patronage and party government in Portugal [Serviço ao poder ou o poder ao serviço?

However, patronage has been conventionally associated with the distribution of jobs in public administration aiming to reward services rendered to the party in government. This is not entirely satisfactory. The growing complexity of governance processes, together with the growing influence of the upper echelons of the civil service in policy making has prompted politicians to search for new ways of controlling the bureaucracy. Through the use of elite interviews, this article seeks to analyze the emergence of an instrumental dimension of patronage, as a potential key resource for parties in government to control the policy-making process and retain a role in modern democratic governance.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Broms, Rasmus</author><author>Dahlström, Carl</author><author>Fazekas, Mihály</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political Competition and Public Procurement Outcomes</title><secondary-title>Comparative Political Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Comparative Political Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>1259-1292</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Sweden</keyword><keyword>bureaucracies</keyword><keyword>corruption and patronage</keyword><keyword>local politics</keyword><keyword>political competition</keyword><keyword>political economy</keyword><keyword>political parties</keyword><keyword>public procurement</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>SAGE Publications Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0010414019830723</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 12</notes><research-notes>cited By 12</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BROMS ET AL Political Competition and Public Procurement 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061982717&amp;doi=10.1177%2F0010414019830723&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=31925bccdc7d3ecd1b8539657ee21b6d</url></web-urls></urls><label>Sweden</label><abstract>This article asks if low political competition is associated with more restricted public procurement processes. Using unique Swedish municipal data from 2009 to 2015, it demonstrates that when one party dominates local politics, noncompetitive outcomes from public procurement processes are more common. What is most striking is that the risk of receiving only one bid, on what is intended to be an open and competitive tender, considerably increases with long-standing one-party rule. The article contributes to a significant body of work on the detrimental effects of low political competition, and the results are particularly interesting from a comparative perspective because Sweden—an old democracy with a meritocratic bureaucracy, characterized by low levels of corruption and clientelism—is a highly unlikely case in which to find such tendencies.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Charlotte</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Party Selection of Officials in Contemporary China</title><secondary-title>Studies in Comparative International Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studies in Comparative International Development</full-title></periodical><pages>356-379</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>ruling party organization</keyword><keyword>selection problem</keyword><keyword>single-party dictatorship</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media, LLC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12116-013-9132-0</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 5</notes><research-notes>cited By 5</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LEE Party Selection China 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028106139&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12116-013-9132-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=67906180257bd1ecea70e015efe77600</url></web-urls></urls><label>China;party bureaucracy</label><abstract>This study considers how, in the absence of elections for national office, authoritarian ruling parties create organizational channels for selecting officials. Through a case study of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), I examine the selection problem facing the ruling party. Within the CCP, special training academies, also known as party schools, serve as a pipeline to higher party and government posts. An examination of selection patterns for these schools reveals that there exists a mix of political and professional factors which determine invitation to a party school training program, suggesting the coexistence of patronage and meritocratic processes in promotion for higher office. Empirical analysis of these selection processes takes three parts. Individual-level characteristics, such as party membership, frequency of interaction with superiors, and educational background, are significant predictors of selection for a party school program. Second, to control for selection bias, I employ a matching procedure and find that the &quot;treatment&quot; of enrollment in a party school training program significantly increases the likelihood that an individual will be promoted to a higher rank in comparison to those without party school training experience. Third, additional tests indicate that these schools serve a screening function for the party, thus providing an organizational means for CCP leaders to manage who enters the highest ranks of political leadership. In this sense, the training process itself serves an informational function for party authorities, beyond the ritual these organizations are long thought to embody.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ennser-Jedenastik, Laurenz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The party politicization of administrative elites in the Netherlands</title><secondary-title>Acta Politica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Politica</full-title></periodical><pages>451-471</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Netherlands</keyword><keyword>administrative elites</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>politicization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1057/s41269-016-0005-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>not available</notes><research-notes>not available</research-notes><urls/><label>Netherlands</label><abstract>This paper explores four potential motivations for the party politicization of the senior civil service: ideological agreement, coalition governance, party family issue priorities, and consociational representation. Using data on the party affiliation of 134 secretaries-general (SGs) serving in the Dutch ministerial bureaucracy between 1945 and 2013, it examines the partisan logic of appointment patterns among senior civil servants in the Netherlands. Overall levels of politicization are very high (almost 70 percent of all SGs have a discernible party affiliation), with a strong increase between 1970 and 1990 and a slight drop-off during the past decades. The appointment patterns suggest that the main drivers behind the party politicization of the Dutch elite bureaucracy are the demand for ideological agreement and a consociational quest for the representation of the 'pillar parties' in the senior civil service.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Veit, Sylvia</author><author>Scholz, Simon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linking administrative career patterns and politicization: signalling effects in the careers of top civil servants in Germany</title><secondary-title>International Review of Administrative Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Review of Administrative Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>516-535</pages><volume>82</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0020852314564310</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://VEIT SCHOLZ Career and Politicization Germany 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Germany;how to measure politicisation;political appointments</label><abstract>This article explores the influence of two types of signalling on the career success of civil servants in the federal ministerial bureaucracy of Germany. Whereas ‘ability signalling’ displays bureaucratic expertise in the sense of both political craft and administrative management competencies, ‘intention signalling’ indicates party politicization. Data are drawn from the biographies of 341 civil servants within the two highest ranks in federal ministries and the chancellery who held office between 2002 and 2013. Taking gender, formal education and career patterns into consideration, we are able to find clear evidence for ‘intention signalling’, whereas ‘ability signalling’ plays only a minor role. Over time, the accelerating effect of ‘intention signalling’ on administrative careers is increasing. Points for practitioners: How important is political loyalty for senior civil servants in merit bureaucracies? This article investigates the relationship between the merit principle and politicization in the German federal bureaucracy. By analysing the importance of certain career steps, we find clear evidence for party politicization. Employment in positions that signal party political loyalty accelerates the careers of ministerial officials, even if the data also prove that there is no distinct ‘fast track’ to leading administrative positions in Germany. Moreover, our analysis reveals an under-representation of women in administrative top positions, as well as the continuing dominance of lawyers. Regarding career patterns, considerable differences between state secretaries and directors-general are evident.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Painter, Martin J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thaksinisation or managerialism?

Carefully chosen instruments of new public management reform such as budgeting for results and performance management have been accompanied by an agenda of wholesale restructuring of the bureaucracy. However, these instruments do not include many familiar items of the public management reform agenda. The reforms are best viewed as part of a politicisation strategy aimed at asserting political control at the centre. Managerial reforms are being deployed to reshape the bureaucracy into an instrument of the Thaksin government's political program. In the process, the traditional power of the bureaucracy is being challenged and undermined. The longer-term impact of the bureaucratic modernisation program on administrative performance is less certain.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alam, Quamrul</author><author>Teicher, Julian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The state of governance in Bangladesh: The capture of state institutions</title><secondary-title>South Asia: Journal of South Asia Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>South Asia: Journal of South Asia Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>858-884</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Bangladesh</keyword><keyword>corruption</keyword><keyword>governance</keyword><keyword>institutions</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>politicisation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00856401.2012.702723</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ALAM TEICHER Governance in Bangladesh.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Bangladesh;patronage</label><abstract>The state of governance in Bangladesh has a chequered history. The country's battle for independence, and its history of military dictatorships and dysfunctional democracy, have brought challenges in terms of establishing a sound system of governance. The five pillars of public governance have posed formidable obstacles to establishing and reforming key institutions, refining processes and strategies of management and guiding the country towards a more efficient and effective system. Here we analyse the backgrounds of legislators elected to parliament in 1991, 1996 and 2001, legislative accountability, functional mechanisms, and the constraints of regulatory, administrative and economic institutions in order to examine how poor governance practices have created high levels of patronage in return for short-term political gains. We argue that state institutions have been captured by members of a powerful nexus who have developed a symbiotic relationship with the state, affecting its institutional capacity to reduce corruption, strengthen transparency and accountability, and allow the judiciary and public bureaucracy to work professionally.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ting, Michael M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Legislatures, bureaucracies, and distributive spending</title><secondary-title>American Political Science Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Political Science Review</full-title></periodical><pages>367-385</pages><volume>106</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0003055412000081</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TING Bureaucracies and Distributive Spending 2012.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>how to measure politicisation</label><abstract>This article develops a theory of bureaucratic influence on distributive politics. Although there exists a rich literature on the effects of institutions such as presidents, electoral systems, and bicameralism on government spending, the role of professional bureaucrats has yet to receive formal scrutiny. In the model, legislators bargain over the allocation of distributive benefits across districts. The legislature may either &quot;politicize&quot; a program by bargaining directly over pork and bypassing bureaucratic scrutiny, or &quot;professionalize&quot; it by letting a bureaucrat approve or reject project funding in each district according to an underlying quality standard. The model predicts that the legislature will professionalize when the expected program quality is high. However, politicization becomes more likely as the number of high-quality projects increases and under divided government. Further, more competent bureaucrats can encourage politicization if the expected program quality is low. Finally, politicized programs are larger than professionalized programs.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spry, Max</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Senior public servants, political discrimination and dismissals</title><secondary-title>Australian Journal of Public Administration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Australian Journal of Public Administration</full-title></periodical><pages>95-100</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1467-8500.00155</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SPRY Senior Public Servants Discrimination 2000.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Australia</label><abstract>In recent years literature on public administration in Australia has often referred to the increasing politicisation of both the federal and state public services.

I argue that to appreciate when and how history matters, we need to consider public service bargains struck between politicians and senior bureaucrats. Doing so complicates the relationship between historical and current administrative systems: a bureaucratic, as opposed to patrimonial, 18th-century state infrastructure is necessary for the depoliticization of ministerial bureaucracies in present-day Western Europe. However, the relationship does not hold in East-Central Europe since administrative histories are tumultuous and fractured. Combining data from across the European continent, I provide evidence in support of these propositions. Points for practitioners: This article addresses policymakers dealing with reforms of personnel policy regimes at the centre of government. It considers the importance of history for politically attractive reforms, as well as the limits of this importance. I argue that 18th-century state infrastructures shape the extent to which political appointments are politically attractive tools for administrative control. I show that only in countries that feature a bureaucratic, as opposed to patrimonial, 18th-century infrastructure are ministerial top management occupied by a permanent, as opposed to politically appointed, staff. However, in East-Central Europe, a ruptured administrative history ensures that the distant past does not similarly shape the extent of political appointments.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Monsod, Toby C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political appointees in the Philippine bureaucracy: do increasing numbers help or harm?</title><secondary-title>Philippine Political Science Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Philippine Political Science Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>1-27</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Politicization</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>government performance</keyword><keyword>political appointees</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01154451.2017.1320130</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MONSOD Political Appointees in the Philippine Bureaucracy 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Phillipines;political appointments</label><abstract>This essay looks at where the line is drawn between political appointees and careerists in the Philippine government and its effects on agency performance.

Of specific interest is the thesis from Lewis that while political appointees in the bureaucracy can be a short term strategy for improving performance, the long term consequences are “pernicious” even when appointees are of consistently high quality.

Contemporary demands for responsive public management contain two emotional injunctions to public bureaucrats. The first, derived from populist doctrines of political right, requires bureaucrats to be responsive to the needs of their 'clients'. In the name of 'recognition' and the 'politics of care', for example, it is thought vital to inculcate in bureaucratic conduct a sense of 'compassion' or close identification with others' feelings. Secondly, in the name of responsiveness to political superiors and the delivery of their policy objectives, bureaucrats are expected to exhibit 'ownership' of and identification with particular policies. They are required to be committed champions for and enthusiastic advocates of those policies. Both of these injunctions are deemed to be more in tune with democratic principles and the currents of contemporary ethical culture ('diversity' or 'human rights', for example) than what is represented as the unlamented Weberian world of rule-bound hierarchy. The paper seeks to question this assessment.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bach, Tobias</author><author>Veit, Sylvia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The determinants of promotion to high public office in Germany: Partisan loyalty, political craft, or managerial competencies?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</full-title></periodical><pages>254-269</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jopart/mux041</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BACH VEIT The determinants of promotion to high public office in Germany 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Germany</label><abstract>The politicization of bureaucracy is a widespread strategy to increase the political control of ministerial departments in parliamentary democracies. It is, however, largely unknown why executive politicians promote some officials rather than others to high public office. Based on a unique dataset of all senior officials in German federal ministries and agencies that held office in the period 1997-2015, this article investigates whether partisan loyalty, political craft, and managerial competencies influence the chance of promotion to the highest civil service position in Germany (state secretary). We apply event history modeling to draw inferences on the relative importance of different selection criteria used by ministers when recruiting state secretaries from a candidate pool of senior officials. A key finding is that ministers consistently prefer politically loyal to nonloyal candidates. Although ministers also consider candidates' political craft and selected managerial competencies, they are likely to trade-off partisan loyalty against those qualifications. The article contributes to the literature on politicization in the public sector by comparing potential and actual office holders and by including a broad set of selection criteria, moving beyond the literature's dominating focus on partisan loyalty.

To assess the relationship between politicization and public opinion, the authors use a data set that combines information on presidential efforts to politicize the Council of Economic Advisers from 1989 to 2004 with that of public attitudes concerning the president's handling of the economy. Their results indicate that public opinion does indeed bear a marginal, yet statistically significant, influence on presidential efforts to manage the federal bureaucracy, thus, providing a new contribution to the debate concerning presidents and the politics of bureaucratic structure.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ting, Michael M.</author><author>Snyder, James M.</author><author>Hirano, Shigeo</author><author>Folke, Olle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Elections and reform: The adoption of civil service systems in the U.S. states</title><secondary-title>Journal of Theoretical Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Theoretical Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>363-387</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>elections</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0951629812453217</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TING ET AL Adoption of Civil Service Systems 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US;how to measure politicisation</label><abstract>Most government bureaucracies in developed countries use civil service systems. What accounts for their adoption? We develop and test a model of bureaucratic reforms under repeated partisan competition. In the model, two political parties composed of overlapping generations of candidates compete for office. Under a spoils system, an incumbent politician can either continue to &quot;politicize&quot; the bureaucracy, which allows her to direct benefits to voters in a way that will increase her electoral prospects, or she can &quot;insulate&quot; the bureaucracy, which prevents all future winners from using the bureaucracy for electoral advantage. Our main result is that politicization persists when incumbents expect to win, and insulation takes place when they expect to lose. We test this hypothesis using data from the adoption of civil service reforms across the U.S. states. The predictions of the model are consistent with the empirical patterns leading up to the implementation of the general civil service reforms. Using both state and city level data, we observe an increase in partisan competition prior to the reforms.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bauer, Michael W.</author><author>Ege, Jörn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Politicization within the European Commission's bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>International Review of Administrative Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Review of Administrative Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>403-424</pages><volume>78</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>European Union</keyword><keyword>European governance</keyword><keyword>administrative reform</keyword><keyword>bureaucratic autonomy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0020852312445022</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BAUER EGE Politicization within the European Commissions bureaucracy 2012.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>EU;definition of politicisation</label><abstract>Against a background of institutional change and organizational reform, we analyze the politicization of the European Commission's bureaucracy. Politicization can generally be defined as the substitution of bureaucratic neutrality by introducing political considerations into the human resource management and behaviour of civil servants. The concepts of direct and professional politicization serve as vantage points for our analysis. The empirical data are taken from documentary analysis and recent online and semi-structured surveys of Commission officials. We show that Commission bureaucrats, although they are highly sensitive to the political side of their job, are less politicized since the Kinnock reforms than before. While the College of the Commission seems to have indeed become more politically responsive to its supranational peers and national governments, the Commission's bureaucracy can be characterized as weakly politicized or, according to current debates, as quite instrumental in a Neo-Weberian sense.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moynihan, Donald P.</author><author>Roberts, Alasdair S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Triumph of Loyalty Over Competence: The Bush Administration and the Exhaustion of the Politicized Presidency</title><secondary-title>Public Administration Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Administration Review</full-title></periodical><pages>572-581</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02178.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MOYNIHAN ROBERT Trump Administration and Politicised Bureaucracy 2010.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>The most important administrative aspect of the George W. Bush presidency was not its formal management reform agenda, but its attempt to extend the politicized presidency. Efforts to assert tighter political control of the federal bureaucracy, revived during the Ronald Reagan administration, were pursued to an extreme under Bush. Loyalty triumphed over competence in selection, and political goals displaced rationality in decision making. However, the strategy of politicization undermined the Bush administration's own policy goals as well as its broader agenda to restore the strength of the institutional presidency. This apparent failure of strategy signals the urgent necessity for a fundamental reconsideration of the politicized presidency.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krotoszynski Jr., Ronald J</author><author>Hodge, Johnjerica</author><author>Wintermyer, Wesley W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PARTISAN BALANCE REQUIREMENTS IN THE AGE OF NEW FORMALISM</title><secondary-title>NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>941-1018</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL, ROOM B1, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA</pub-location><publisher>NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://KROTOSYNSKI Partisan Balance Requirements in the Age of New Formalism 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>political appointments</label><abstract>This Article considers the constitutional status of mandatory partisan balance requirements for presidential appointments to independent federal agencies. Since the 1880s, Congress routinely has included partisan balance requirements, along with fixed terms of office and ``good cause{''} limitations on the President's removal power, as standard design elements in its template for independent federal agencies. Until recently, both federal courts and most legal scholars have assumed the constitutionality of such restrictions on the President's appointment power and with good reason, given the ubiquity of partisan balance requirements and the executive branch's historical acquiescence to them. However, the Supreme Court's decision in Free Enterprise Fund threatens to upend this well-settled consensus; the decision squarely holds that Congress may not unduly attenuate the President's power to supervise and control executive branch entities including independent agencies without violating the separation of powers doctrine. In this Article, we posit that partisan balance requirements, at least when used in conjunction with fixed terms of office and good cause removal limitations, create a problem of at least equal magnitude to the problem identified in Free Enterprise Fund (namely, unduly insulating executive officers with policymaking authority via a two-tiered good cause removal limitation). Under the logic of Free Enterprise Fund, requiring the President to appoint political opponents to principal offices within the executive branch, and then prohibiting the President from removing such appointees except for good cause, unduly compromises the President's ability to supervise and control these agencies. Although Humphrey's Executor settled the constitutional status of good cause limits on the President's removal power for principal officers serving on independent federal agencies, Free Enterprise Fund `s broadly formalist reading of the Vesting and Faithful Execution Clauses strongly suggests that the combination of a partisan balance requirement with a good cause removal limit constitutes a bridge too far in the age of new formalism.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amorim Neto, Octavio</author><author>Accorsi, Pedro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presidents and Generals: Systems of Government and the Selection of Defense Ministers</title><secondary-title>ARMED FORCES \&amp; SOCIETY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ARMED FORCES \&amp; SOCIETY</full-title></periodical><pages>136-163</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>civil-military relations</keyword><keyword>defense policy</keyword><keyword>democracy</keyword><keyword>governmental organization</keyword><keyword>militarism</keyword><keyword>political science</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><pub-location>2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA</pub-location><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0095327X19900368</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NETO ACCORSI Systems of Government and the Selection of Defense Ministers 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>armed forces in civil positions;political appointments</label><abstract>Defense ministers are among the most central players in democracies' civil-military relations. This article aims to identify the determinants of the selection criteria of defense ministers in democracies and semi-democracies. More specifically, it attempts to measure the effects of systems of government on decisions to appoint civilians or military officers to head the defense ministry. We argue that some characteristics of presidentialized regimes lead to the appointment of military defense ministers. This is a novel contribution, one that connects the literature on civil-military relations and that on systems of government. To assess our hypothesis and its mechanisms, we use comprehensive cross-national data in 1975-2015. Our tests indicate a robust association between presidentialized systems of government and the appointment of military ministers. We also show that military defense ministers are associated with some relevant outcomes. These findings have important implications for the study of civil-military relations, defense policy, and democracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Etzion, Dror</author><author>Davis, Gerald F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Revolving doors?

We find that the Bush administration recruited far more heavily from among corporate officers and directors than did the Clinton administration, particularly when staffing ambassadorships. We also find that both administrations served as springboards for subsequent corporate board appointments. There were relatively few patterns with respect to industry or geography, with the exception of the military: All but one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the turn of the millennium ended up serving on the board of a military contractor after completing their government service.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lederer, Markus</author><author>Wallbott, Linda</author><author>Urban, Frauke</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Fouquet, Roger</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Green transformations and state bureaucracy in the global South</title><secondary-title>Handbook on Green Growth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Handbook on Green Growth</full-title></periodical><pages>404-424</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>Cheltenham</pub-location><publisher>Edward Elgar</publisher><isbn>9781788110686</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4337/9781788110686.00026</electronic-resource-num><notes>Text not available</notes><research-notes>Text not available</research-notes><urls/><abstract>This chapter presents a valuable framework for analysing green transformations in developing economies using two case studies from the so-called Global South: Costa Rica and Vietnam. Central lessons for other countries are that Costa Rica reversed its pathway of deforestation by reforesting the land and then addressing criticisms of its development by generating more genuinely green growth. Vietnam has previously focused on post-conflict restoration and economic development and has now turned towards green transformations, announcing an ambitious green growth strategy. The chapter shows that these countries – rather than having chosen easy pathways – made difficult choices that went against powerful vested interest groups within the country. This makes the decisions (and possibly the experiences) particularly relevant to other (smaller) countries considering taking a pathway involving green transformation.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yakovlev, Andrei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Russian modernization: Between the need for new players and the fear of losing control of rent sources</title><secondary-title>Journal of Eurasian Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Eurasian Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>10-20</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Russian transition economy</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>investment climate</keyword><keyword>modernization from above</keyword><keyword>rents</keyword><keyword>response to the crises</keyword><keyword>violent pressure on business</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.euras.2013.09.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://YAKOVLEV Russian modernization 2014.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Russia</label><abstract>This paper considers current contradictions in state-business relations in Russia. On one hand, the Russian political elite needs economic growth to keep social stability in the country and to limit mass protesting in big cities. Economic growth is impossible without investment, which explains Russian leaders' increased interest in improving Russia's business climate. On the other hand, influential interest groups (represented first of all by security and law enforcement agencies) try to expand their control on rent sources in the economy. These groups of interests could strengthen their positions due to fear of political protests. This strong conflict among different groups in the Russian elite creates additional uncertainty for investors and the business community, and can lead to economic recession independent of the level of oil prices and dynamics of global markets. Reversing these negative trends in economic development will be possible only with collective actions of different economic and political actors (including technocrats in federal and regional governments, representatives of large and successful middle-sized business and top-managers of public sector organizations) in the search for pragmatic solutions to the challenges faced by Russian economy and society.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sorge, Marco Maria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying-consistent delegation and sequential policy making</title><secondary-title>Economics Bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Economics Bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>3088-3102</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SORGE Lobbying-consistent Delegation and Sequential Policy Making 2010.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>This paper studies the relationship between interest group political influence and allocation of decisionmaking power in a potentially divided government. We consider a simple endogenous policy model in which a legislator is in charge of setting the levels of two different policy instruments - a tax rate and a revenue redistribution scheme - and may decide to delegate policy authority over the allocation task to a bureaucracy within a hierarchy. An organized group is able to influence the political process at both tiers through the provision of policy-contingent contributions. We find conditions under which legislative delegation and sequential decisionmaking are consistent in equilibrium with the presence of two-tier lobbying, as the effects of the former on the allocation of lobbying activities exactly counterbalance the loss from bureaucracy's capture. As a consequence, we find that the possibility of multitier lobbying within a divided government need not be harmful to the higher level policy maker in the political equilibrium.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Staudt, Kathleen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>1/Gender politics in bureaucracy: Theoretical issues in comparative perspective</title><secondary-title>Women, International Development: And Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Women, International Development: And Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>3-34</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>9781566395465</isbn><notes>Not available - Requested through Research Gate</notes><research-notes>Not available - Requested through Research Gate</research-notes><urls/><abstract>Over the international decade for women, 1975-1985, there were many dialogues, lobbying activities, legislative and policy mandates, yet barely a dent was made in the redistribution of resources and values from men to women. The oft-quoted statement from the 1980 Copenhagen Programme of Action starkly summarizes how one-half the world's population performs two-thirds of the world's work, receives one-tenth of world income, and owns less than 1 percent of world property.1 At least at the aggregate level, little progress has been made in dismantling institutionalized male privilege. Such institutionalized privilege is deeply embedded in the state2 and grounded in a western cultural heritage3 that has spread throughout the world in different degrees. Prospects for redistributive change look grim. At the same time, changes over the past century would appear to set the stage for gradual redistribution. First, states seek to legitimize themselves through public policy and participation-based accountability. State policies intrude, for better or worse, into a so-called private sphere in which women are located. Participation expands to include women as voters, group advocates, and decision makers.4 Second, a veritable explosion of women's organizational activity and political agenda setting transpired over the women's decade. Many activists hope to take a concrete feminist agenda into the bureaucracy and thereby broaden state accountability to women. Over the decade, what the United Nations terms &quot;national machineries&quot; for the advancement of women have been promoted, such that 120 were counted by 19805 and 90 percent of governments were covered by 1985.6 If the aim is to get a female foot in the door and work from within, a better understanding is needed of what approaches work best in which settings. More than one-half of the resolutions of Forward Looking Strategies, from the 1985 end-of-the-decade conference in Nairobi, call for action from governments, ranging from equalizing access to education and removing stereotypes from the media to providing credit and land ownership to women farmers.7 Yet these are the very same governments that have heretofore perpetuated the kind of gendered policies that disempower women within gendered bureaucratic organizations. Should women work in, with, or against the state? Can state bureaucracies empower women? States respond to calls for gender redistribution in varying ways; comparisons of institutions, their cultural, political, and economic contexts, and their inhabitants' prevailing ideologies should tell us why. Contributors in this book explore women's politics and programs in the bureaucracy, as well as the implementation processes. At minimum, this exploration leads to a focus on both attitudes and structures: the bureaucrats and their ideologies of gender and of household relations, and their interactions with the institutional settings in which they work. We need to know more about men who dominate decision making in the bureaucracy and how they vary in diverse institutional settings. At the same time, we need to ask whether women will infuse a new sort of politics into male-oriented bureaucracy. Women have entered the realms of bureaucratic politics, and women's organizations increasingly form part of bureaucratic constituencies. Will women's very presence on the inside help women on the outside? Will women encourage bureaucracy to operate according to its Weberian &quot;ideal&quot; fashion, that is, in a neutral or gender-neutral fashion? (And is that a &quot;good&quot;?) Or does the hierarchical ordering of dominant-subordinate relationships in bureaucracy mire any prospects for gender redistribution? Some feminist theorists have argued that bureaucratic means are incompatible with feminist ends8 and that the male-oriented state cannot accommodate or respond to women.9 This book takes the first step toward comparative analysis of gender redistributive policy by looking at its practices in international, governmental, and nongovernmental institutions in a wide variety of national and cultural contexts. This introductory essay examines the existing literature on bureaucratic movement toward gender redistribution, which suggests a grim scenario for upcoming decades. A discussion of &quot;gendered bureaucracy&quot; is then put forward to frame and explain the phenomenon in political terms, After that, the chapter explores possibilities for change. The closing contains an overview of the papers in the book, though discussion of their contents is woven into the body of this essay as well. First, however, the connections between gender, development, and the state are laid out.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haselswerdt, Jake</author><author>Bradley, Katharine W.

It is a fact that the management of these organizations is affected by the actions of interest groups, especially in Brazil, which is characterized by patrimonial practices, among other things. This context forces those who work in the public sphere to constantly face the dilemma of collective action, summarized in the following question: Under such conditions, is it possible for the public organizations to act in the collective interest? To answer this question, which is related to the structure-agency debate, this work suggests two responses: One that emphasizes the agency, rationality and the formation of preferences; and another, structural, based on bureaucratic insulation and social inclusion. After such considerations, and for the purpose of illustrating the relevance of the two responses, the article discusses the case of the Bolsa Familia program (family grant), highlighting the contribution of Caixa Econômica Federal and the Municipalities for the success of the program. In the end, the authors present their conclusions and recommendations for future studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coban, Mehmet K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coordinating monetary policy and macroprudential policy: Bureaucratic politics, regulatory intermediary, and bank lobbying</title><secondary-title>Public Administration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Administration</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/padm.12744</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://COBAN Coordinating monetary policy and macroprudential policy  Bureaucratic politics 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Turkey</label><abstract>We tend to overlook the linkages between how policy coordination within bureaucracy is achieved and the nontrivial implications of policy coordination for business power over the policy process. This article addresses this gap by exploring macroprudential regulatory governance in Turkey. Drawing on elite interviews and written sources, the article argues that analytically and operationally more capable and politically endorsed central bank subordinated the autonomous bank regulator, as the latter assumed a de facto regulatory intermediary role between the former and the regulatee. Within this setting, the regulatee could not rely on its structural and institutional power for mobilization of instrumental power to contest and overturn macroprudential measures. The article contributes to our understanding of the conditions of policy coordination within bureaucracy, how de jure regulator could be subordinated as a de facto regulatory intermediary, and why influential business power needs both a politically and bureaucratically enabling setting.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazey, Sonia</author><author>Richardson, Jeremy</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Richardson, Jeremy</author><author>Mazey, Sonia</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Shooting where the ducks are: EU lobbying and institutionalized promiscuity</title><secondary-title>European Union: Power and policy-making</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Union: Power and policy-making</full-title></periodical><pages>419-443</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>London</pub-location><publisher>Routledge</publisher><isbn>9781317563846</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4324/9781315735399-18</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MAZEY RICHARDSON Lobbying in the EU and bureaucracy 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>This chapter discusses the development and nature of the European Union (EU) lobbying system. Pallis has documented the mobilization of maritime transport groups since the mid-1970s. He noted that the EU has been trying to develop a Common Maritime Transport Policy, the scope and depth of the policies has shifted from minimalist to an approach that considers comprehensive EU policies. As a result of this power shift to the EU level a variety of stakeholders has identified a new level of power, and has formed EU-level interest groups seeking to ‘shoot where the ducks are’. The chapter discusses bureaucracy and the particular behavioural traits that modern bureaucracies exhibit. Anthony Downs formulated many hypotheses concerning bureaucratic behaviour. This chapter concludes by suggesting that lobbying in the EU is likely to remain pluralistic, unpredictable and favouring those actors who can mobilize ideas and knowledge in order to influence the framing of public policies.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Papaioannou, Theo</author><author>Watkins, Andrew</author><author>Kale, Dinar</author><author>Mugwagwa, Julius</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Politics of innovation and development: The role of industry associations in integrating political, bureaucratic, industrial and health systems in India and South Africa</title><secondary-title>Development Policy Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Development Policy Review</full-title></periodical><pages>O531-O551</pages><volume>36</volume><keywords><keyword>India</keyword><keyword>South Africa</keyword><keyword>development policy</keyword><keyword>health systems</keyword><keyword>industry associations</keyword><keyword>politics of innovation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/dpr.12308</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://PAPAIOANNOU Politics of innovation and development 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>India;South Africa</label><abstract>Integrating political, bureaucratic, industrial and healthcare systems has been a major challenge for politics of innovation and development policy in low- and middle-income countries. This challenge has so far been understood in terms of separate industrial and health-related innovation policies without paying adequate attention to the institutional roles of biopharmaceutical and other umbrella associations. This article seeks to examine such roles in the developmental contexts of South Africa and India. The argument put forward is that, in both countries, biopharmaceutical and umbrella associations have evolved from lobbying organizations to institutional partners who influence the politics of innovation and development—and therefore the degree of integration and fragmentation—of political, bureaucratic, industrial innovation and health systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedahzur, Ami</author><author>McCarthy, Holly</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Against all odds - the paradoxical victory of the West Bank settlers: interest groups and policy enforcement</title><secondary-title>ISRAEL AFFAIRS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ISRAEL AFFAIRS</full-title></periodical><pages>443-461</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>3, SI</issue><keywords><keyword>West Bank</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>settlers</keyword><keyword>strategy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/13537121.2015.1036562</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://PEDAHZUR MCCARTHY interest groups and policy enforcement 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Israel</label><abstract>The settlers constitute a minority group whose goals are becoming increasingly unpopular among Israelis. As a result, the degree of legitimacy granted to them by the government gradually eroded over the years. However, their project still thrives. Their impressive success can be attributed to their focus on the bureaucracy. As early as the 1960s, the settlers engaged in a constant effort to identify actors in state and semi-state agencies that had common interests with them. At first they mobilized supporters from within those agencies. Later they made any effort to fill available positions with their own people. Today, the settlers' movement in Israel has fused itself with the relevant elements within the bureaucracy to a degree that many state agencies serve as extensions of the settler movement.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harris, Joseph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>``Developmental Capture'' of the State: Explaining Thailand's Universal Coverage Policy</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLITICS POLICY AND LAW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLITICS POLICY AND LAW</full-title></periodical><pages>165-193</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>1, SI</issue><keywords><keyword>Thailand</keyword><keyword>politics</keyword><keyword>universal coverage</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>DUKE UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1215/03616878-2854689</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HARRIS Developmental Capture of the State 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Thailand</label><abstract>The notion of ``regulatory capture'' is typically used to describe the takeover of state agencies by outside interest groups that seek to weaken regulation and advance the agendas of interest groups through control over state policy levers. This concept can be contrasted with that of ``developmental capture'' of state agencies by networks of reformist bureaucrats within the state who seek to promote inclusive state social and developmental policies of benefit to the broader populace. Building on work that has pointed to instances in which state bureaucrats act autonomously from societal and political pressures, this article argues that existing explanations are insufficient for explaining Thailand's universal health care policy. It points to the critical role played by a network of bureaucrats within the state who strategically mobilized resources in the bureaucracy, political parties, civil society, and international organizations to institutionalize universal health care in the face of broader professional dissent, political uncertainty, and international pressure.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Epstein, Gil S.</author><author>Nitzan, Shmuel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Endogenous public policy, politicization and welfare</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Economic Theory</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Economic Theory</full-title></periodical><pages>661-677</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1097-3923.00114</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://EPSTEIN NITZAN Endogenous Public Policy  Politicization and Welfare 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>how to measure politicisation</label><abstract>In the two-stage political-economic game that we study public policy is the outcome of the interaction between interest groups and a two-tier government. Implementation of a policy proposed by a bureaucrat requires approval by an elected politician. The objective function of the bureaucrat hinges on the weight assigned to social welfare relative to the rent-seeking outlays of the interest groups. This weight represents the degree of politicization of the government. Our main result is that, in contrast to common belief, increased politicization need not adversely affect the public well-being.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jordan, Stuart V.</author><author>Meirowitz, Adam</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying and discretion</title><secondary-title>Economic Theory</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Economic Theory</full-title></periodical><pages>683-702</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>agency theory</keyword><keyword>contest</keyword><keyword>discretion</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00199-011-0634-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://JORDAN MEIROWITZ Lobbying and Discretion 2012.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>When interest groups compete to influence legislators, the resulting legislation is often vague, and thus obliges the groups to continue their fight in the executive. On its face, this seems inefficient-at least from the point of view of the groups. We explore this intuition in a model of &quot;nested lobbying&quot; in which interest groups first compete to influence a legislative agenda setter, then compete to influence legislative votes over the resulting agenda. If the resulting legislation grants discretion to the executive, the final prize is allocated in yet one more contest in the bureaucracy. We find that when the status quo is non-discretionary, competition over the agenda never results in an agenda that includes discretion. Surprisingly, however, a discretionary status quo can stand with probability 1 if the preferences of the bureaucracy, the legislature, and the agenda setter are arranged in an &quot;iron triangle&quot;. Specifically, the bureaucracy and agenda setter must be biased in favor of one group, while the legislature is biased in favor of the other.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerqueti, Roy</author><author>Coppier, Raffaella</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A game for exploring political and bureaucratic corruption</title><secondary-title>IMA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT MATHEMATICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IMA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT MATHEMATICS</full-title></periodical><pages>151-173</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucratic corruption</keyword><keyword>game with imperfect information</keyword><keyword>industrial organization</keyword><keyword>political corruption</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>OXFORD UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/imaman/dpw017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CERQUETTI COPPIER A game for exploring political and bureaucratic corruption 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>This article deals with the relationship between bureaucratic corruption and political corruption from the perspective of the industrial structure of a country. In so doing, we discuss whether political corruption and bureaucratic corruption can coexist. For this purpose, a suitable theoretical game model with imperfect information is constructed and solved. We demonstrate that the size of capital of a specific firm influences the decision of such firm to bribe the bureaucrat or lobby the government. Therefore, political and bureaucratic corruption are substitutes at the level of the firm because they depend on the capital of the firm, but they can coexist at a macro level. Some numerical experiments validate the theoretical model.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Masud, Mehedi</author><author>Hossain, Md Rakib</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interpreting lived experiences: The dilemmas of public sector leaders</title><secondary-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>180-190</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>dilemma</keyword><keyword>lived experiences</keyword><keyword>new public management</keyword><keyword>public sector leadership</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/pad.1957</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MASUD HOSSAIN Dilemma of Public Leaders 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Bangladesh</label><abstract>Dilemmas are a useful concept for exploring leadership practices and decision-making process.

Taking an interpretive approach, this research presents empirical insights in an important subfield of public administration, namely, lived experiences of PSL about the public sector reforms and governance practice. The researchers administered in-depth interviews and Focus Group Discussion (FGD). What emerged as the salient dilemmas of PSLs are: the dilemma of public sector leadership: the colonial legacy, power relationship dilemma in the system of government, domestic reform strategy versus donor reform strategy, public interest versus vested interest and lastly, commitment versus service to multiple stakeholders. It also identified that there is a significant presence of NPM overtones in the PSL response towards the reform programme that illustrates the prominent features of decentralization and bureaucratic entrepreneurship.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schneider, Gerald</author><author>Baltz, Konstantin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Domesticated eurocrats: Bureaucratic discretion in the legislative pre-negotiations of the European Union</title><secondary-title>ACTA POLITICA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACTA POLITICA</full-title></periodical><pages>1-27</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Council of Ministers</keyword><keyword>European Union</keyword><keyword>agenda setting</keyword><keyword>bureaucratic discretion</keyword><keyword>delegation</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><publisher>PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500092</electronic-resource-num><notes>2nd General Conference of the

We assess the conditions under which the ministry in charge of the pre-negotiations is able to withstand attempts of domestic stakeholders to change the national bargaining stance. Our case studies and multivariate regressions on 15 legislative proposals show that the overall conflict between domestic stakeholders and pressure from powerful interest groups make such changes more likely. Parliamentary actors and parties do, conversely, not possess much power in these often technical deliberations. Although governments and their bureaucracies have to yield in some situations, they possess ample discretion in the average decision-making process. We illustrate our findings with a comparative case study on the controversial attempt by the Commission to regulate the usage of PVC softeners in toys.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Hongseok</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does Increasing Racial Minority Representation Contribute to Overall Organizational Performance?

Many studies have focused on the link between passive representation, or the extent to which the public workforce reflects the demographic characteristics of its clients, and active representation, or the extent to which policies advance the interests of those people. However, little research has been done on whether and when increased representation by a certain group enhances overall organizational performance. This study examines the relationship between racial minority representation in U.S. federal agencies and the agencies' goal achievement while considering the moderating role of organizational mission and diversity climate. The panel data analysis shows that increased minority representation lowers agencies' goal achievement. However, a positive relationship exists between the two in agencies that mainly work to promote social equity for disadvantaged populations and foster a positive diversity climate in the workplace. These findings suggest that racial minority employees can better contribute to organizational success in agencies where they balance advocacy and organizational roles well and they are treated fairly and respectfully.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yim, Hyung Rok</author><author>Lu, Jiangyong</author><author>Choi, Seong-Jin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Different role of lobbying and bribery on the firm performance in emerging markets</title><secondary-title>MULTINATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MULTINATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>222-238</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Entrepreneur corruption</keyword><keyword>bribery</keyword><keyword>corporate political activity (CPA)</keyword><keyword>cross-country analysis</keyword><keyword>emerging markets</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1108/MBR-07-2017-0050</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://YIM ET AL Lobbying Bribery Bureaucracy 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Purpose - Firms influence a government to their advantage in one of two ways: either through lobbying a government to change the rule, or through bribing bureaucrats to circumvent the rule. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether and under what conditions do corporate political activities facilitate firm growth in a multinational context, especially in developing economies. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on the data of the World Bank's Enterprise Survey, conducted by the World Bank in the 2002 to 2006 period in 12 countries. To deal with a multilevel structure, the authors applied multilevel regression as the main analysis method. Findings - The analysis reveals that both political activities are prevalent in emerging markets, but they play very different roles on firm growth. The authors also find that the effect of lobbying is more pronounced in politically durable countries where firms can secure their vested benefits by lobbying. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the corporate political activities literature by investigating the distinguishing and contingent role of bribery and lobbying on firm performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Choi, Seong-jin</author><author>Jimenez, Alfredo</author><author>Lee, Jeoung Yul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of political capabilities and political markets on firms' decision to lobby</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><volume>26</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>corporate political activity</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>multinational strategy</keyword><keyword>political capabilities</keyword><keyword>political structure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>ELSEVIER</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.intman.2020.100796</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CHOI ET AL Political Capabilities Lobbying 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>This paper investigates how firms' political capabilities and countries' political structures affect firms' lobbying decision. We use a cross-country, firm-level dataset that covers more than 22,013 firms in 46 countries to discover that a firm's individual- and collective-level political capabilities are positively associated with lobbying. In contrast, the degree of checks and balances among bureaucrats in a country's political market is negatively associated with the firm's possibility of lobbying. Finally, we also find that the positive role of a firm's political capabilities in lobbying is mitigated by the degree of checks and balances among bureaucrats. This study contributes to the literature of corporate political activities by filling the research gaps (1) as considering both horizontal and vertical checks and balances among bureaucrats in political markets, and (2) as simultaneously considering firms' individual and collective political capabilities, by taking one more conceptual step on the literature of contingent dynamic capabilities and lobbying.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gailmard, Sean</author><author>Patty, John Wiggs</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Participation, process and policy: The informational value of politicised judicial review</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>233-260</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucratic rulemaking</keyword><keyword>information and expertise</keyword><keyword>judicialreview</keyword><keyword>notice and comment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0143814X16000106</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GAILMARD PATTY Participation Process Policy 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>We develop a model of notice and comment rulemaking, focussing on strategic issues facing agencies and interest groups in light of judicial review in this process. Specifically, we analyse the incentives for agencies and groups to produce and reveal information during rulemaking. We show that judicial review can produce informed policymaking, but that participatory rulemaking can bias agency policymaking in favour of groups with access to the rule-making process. In addition, the model allows an analysis of doctrines of judicial review of agency policymaking. The model reveals that politicised judicial review can be beneficial because of its effects on agency incentives for information acquisition in policymaking. Accordingly, socially optimal judicial review may be legally irrational and, contrary to standard doctrines of judicial review in the United States, judicial deference to rules with thin records can be optimal.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bertelli, Anthony M.</author><author>Lynn Jr., Laurence E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Policymaking in the parellelogram of forces: Common agency and human service provision</title><secondary-title>POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>297-315</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><publisher>BLACKWELL PUBLISHERS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1541-0072.2004.00067.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BERTELLI LYNN JR Policymaking in the Parallelogram of Forces 2004.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>The ``congressional dominance'' literature in political science provides valuable insights into the legislative control of administrative agencies.

This paper examines the accounting dimension of reforms designed to achieve enhanced administrative efficiency and greater economy in the operation of government departments. A growing interest in the role of accounting within British government during the second quarter of the nineteenth century is elucidated, and prevailing ideas concerning how accounting within government departments and accountability from the executive to parliament might be performed more efficiently and effectively are uncovered. The battle between divergent pressure groups concerning who should possess jurisdiction over accounting work is explored, and the solution to this problematic is found to connect with the nature of a central government accounting system that was itself undergoing significant change. Consistency between the Northcote-Trevelyan recommendations and ongoing internal initiatives designed to ensure the competence of clerks recruited to undertake accounting work and subsequently applying for promotion to a higher grade is demonstrated.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brandt, Urs S.</author><author>Svendsen, Gert T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bureaucrats at sea: A budget catch model</title><secondary-title>Journal of European Public Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of European Public Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>329-340</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>European Union</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>lobbyism</keyword><keyword>public goods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/13501760500528795</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BRANDT SVENDSEN Bureaucrats Lobbyists EU 2006.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>We develop a model of bureaucratic budget catching, where bureaucracies compete for resources just like fishermen. Considering taxpayers' money a free access resource in the absence of tight fiscal control (passive sponsors), bureaucratic self-interest may induce excessive lobbying behaviour even from the perspective of the bureaucrats themselves. Our contribution is to extend the original Niskanen (1971) model by suggesting that bureaucrats will expend resources on lobbying rather than provide public goods, thus rendering the bureaus more inefficient. Such decreases in public good provision affect production in society negatively in the next period, leaving fewer resources for the total group of bureaucrats. One possible empirical implication could be bureaucratic lobbying within the EU due to the institutional stronghold of the Commission. Arguably, the weak institutional position of the European Parliament probably contributed to the observable priority of public goods provision. However, rigorous empirical investigations are needed in future to verify or reject our theoretical claims.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsujinaka, Yukata</author><author>Pekkanen, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Civil society and interest groups in contemporary Japan</title><secondary-title>Pacific Affairs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pacific Affairs</full-title></periodical><pages>419-437</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5509/2007803419</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TSUJINAKA PEKKANEN Civil Society and Interest Groups in Japan 2007.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Japan</label><abstract>This article probes the extent to which the new literature on civil society should lead to a revised understanding of Japan's political economy and policymaking processes. We seek to place two literatures - the older work on political economy and the more recent writings on civil society - in perspective. The article presents a broad analysis of the influence of civil society groups, drawing evidence from the JIGS survey of interest groups, an extensive random sample survey of more than 1,600 associations in Tokyo and also in Ibaraki Prefecture, involving 36 questions and 260 subquestions. The analysis provides a general overview of the involvement of civil society groups in the policymaking process. We focus on three main aspects. First, we distinguish among the types of groups that involve themselves in policy making. These groups are broken down in the JIGS survey by their predominant activity (e.g., agricultural groups or sports groups) and their legal status. Second, we investigate in which areas groups seek to influence policy. This means both the broad issue area (e.g., agriculture) as well as the groups' response to a specific list of policy changes over the past decade. Third, we probe the relationships these groups have with other groups as well as with other political actors (e.g., local governments, political parties). Also, we are concerned with the means by which the groups seek to influence policy making - and we include in this category specific information such as whether the groups offered electoral support or provided postretirement posts to bureaucrats. We find that Japanese associational structure is characterized by the pronounced strength of economic or business organizations compared to other groups. This is true when we look at the number of groups, the size or resources of the organizations and the success that economic groups have in gaining access to policy makers. Our evidence reinforces the picture of high levels of communication and interaction between business organizations and the economic bureaucracy, and the relative exclusion of citizens' groups.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dahlström, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Bureaucratic Politics of Welfare-State Crisis: Sweden in the 1990s</title><secondary-title>GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS</full-title></periodical><pages>217-238</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01433.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DAHLSTRÖM Bureaucratic Politics Sweden 2009.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Sweden</label><abstract>This article suggests that key bureaucrats play a decisive role in times of welfare crisis. It argues that key bureaucrats, through their advice, define both the type of welfare crisis and the range of possible solutions, which have at least two important consequences: First, it broadens the distribution of welfare cuts, as key bureaucrats-contrary to politicians-have no interests in targeting special voter groups. Second, it enables political compromises, as both the government and the opposition trust the key bureaucrats' expertise. These suggestions are tested empirically in a case study of Sweden in the 1990s. It shows that key bureaucrats did indeed influence both the distribution of the cuts and enabled a compromise between the center-right government and the Social Democratic opposition.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Flavin, Patrick</author><author>Hartney, Michael T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>When Government Subsidizes Its Own: Collective Bargaining Laws as Agents of Political Mobilization</title><secondary-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>896-911</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/ajps.12163</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://FLAVIN When Government Subsidizes Its Own 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Government policies can activate a political constituency not only by providing material resources to, or altering the interpretive experiences of, individual citizens, but also by directly subsidizing established interest groups. We argue that state laws mandating collective bargaining for public employees provided organizational subsidies to public sector labor unions that lowered the costs of mobilizing their members to political action. Exploiting variation in the timing of laws across the states and using data on the political participation of public school teachers from 1956 to 2004, we find that the enactment of a mandatory bargaining law significantly boosted subsequent political participation among teachers. We also identify increased contact from organized groups seeking to mobilize teachers as a likely mechanism that explains this finding. These results have important implications for the current debate over collective bargaining rights and for our understanding of policy feedback, political parties and interest groups, and the bureaucracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lim, Haeran</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Transformation of the Developmental State and Economic Reform in Korea</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA</full-title></periodical><pages>188-210</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>coalition theory</keyword><keyword>democratisation</keyword><keyword>developmental states</keyword><keyword>economic reform</keyword><keyword>political economy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00472331003597547</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LIM Transformation of Developmental State Korea 2010.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Korea</label><abstract>This paper analyses the political economy of economic reform and the ways in which the characteristics of developmental states have been changed in this reform process. It does this with attention to the experience of structural transformation in the manufacturing, information technology and financial sectors in Korea. Using the coalition theory of policy reform, the main finding from these cases is that the relationships among politicians, bureaucrats and interest groups have been altered so that interest groups' power has been strengthened compared to politicians and bureaucrats. Although a crisis is important in promoting economic reform, broader-ranging trends, such as democratisation, globalisation and technological progress, have also been important fundamental forces. Even with change, the reform process in Korea continues to reflect the legacies of the developmental state, with the state still playing an important role in planning, implementing and sustaining economic reform.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Binderkrantz, Anne S.</author><author>Pedersen, Helene H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What is access? a discussion of the definition and measurement of interest group access</title><secondary-title>EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>306-319</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>access</keyword><keyword>democracy</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>measurement</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1057/eps.2016.17</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BINDERKRANTZ PEDERSEN What is Access 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Interest group research has focused extensively on political access. While access does not guarantee influence, it is customarily seen as a crucial step towards gaining political influence. It is argued that groups with access are, all else equal, more likely to be influential than groups without access. Biased access may thus result in biased influence. On the basis of a review of this literature, the article shows how the concept of access rests on an intuitive understanding rather than an explicit definition. This hampers methodological discussions of measurement. We propose to define access as instances where a group has entered a political arena (parliament, administration, or media) passing a threshold controlled by relevant gatekeepers (politicians, civil servants, or journalists). On the basis of this discussion, we compare operationalisations based on our proposed definition with some of the major alternatives found in the literature.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bursens, Peter</author><author>Beyers, Jan</author><author>Donas, Tom</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Domestic European Union Coordination and Interest Group Mobilization in Three Member States: Looking Beyond the Formal Mechanisms</title><secondary-title>Regional and Federal Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Regional and Federal Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>363-381</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>European Union</keyword><keyword>domestic coordination</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>regions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/13597566.2014.911739</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BURSENS ET AL Domestic European Union Coordination 2014.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Belgium;France;Netherlands</label><abstract>One conclusion in the literature on domestic European Union (EU) coordination is that the formal institutional properties of countries-devolved versus centralized or unitary-affect the nature of coordination practices. Basically, the view has emerged that domestic coordination is a largely bureaucratic process in which political control mechanisms remain relatively weak. Instead of only looking at public authorities and their formal networks, this article relies on a data set that allows us to analyse informal political-administrative networks and look at how societal interests mobilize and target policymakers in order to shape the position governments defend at the EU level. One of our conclusions is that despite devolution in Belgium, its intergovernmental coordination shows a considerable level of network centralization, even when compared to unitary countries such as France and the Netherlands, meaning that there are large differences between the three states with respect to the connectedness of the actors involved.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yackee, Susan Webb</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sweet-talking the fourth branch: The influence of interest group comments on federal agency rulemaking</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</full-title></periodical><pages>103-124</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jopart/mui042</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://YACKEE Interest Group Influence on Federal Agency 2006.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Students of politics have identified a variety of actors who appear to influence the federal bureaucracy's implementation of public policy, including Congress, the president, and interest groups. These lines of research, however, have often portrayed interest groups as actors with indirect influence (who, for example, work through or with Congress), rather than assessing the direct influence of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs. I conduct a test of direct interest group influence by analyzing an original data set composed of 1,444 interest group comments in reaction to forty federal agency rules. I find, contrary to the expectations of the extant literature, that the formal participation of interest groups during rulemaking can, and often does, alter the content of policy within the &quot;fourth branch&quot; of government. I conclude that those who voice their preferences during the notice and comment period rulemaking are often able to change government policy outputs to better match their preferences.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bennedsen, Morten</author><author>Feldmann, Sven E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying bureaucrats</title><secondary-title>Scandinavian Journal of Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scandinavian Journal of Economics</full-title></periodical><pages>643-668</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>delegation</keyword><keyword>divided government</keyword><keyword>interest group influence</keyword><keyword>political institutions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1467-9442.2006.00473.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BENNEDSEN FELDMAN Lobbying Bureaucrats 2006.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We study how interest group lobbying of the bureaucracy affects policy outcomes and how it changes the legislature's willingness to delegate decision-making authority to the bureaucracy.

We analyze how the decision to delegate changes when the bureaucratic agent is subject to external influence. The optimal degree of delegation as well as the extent to which interest groups influence policy outcomes differ depending on whether the system of government is characterized by unified or divided control.

There are several possible explanations for this, including changing government policy styles, the perception of the importance of tourism to the national economy, and the developing sophistication of a tourism policy network. This paper reviews the role of interested groups and the nature of tourism policy development in England within the context of a theoretical discussion on public policy analysis, policy styles and policy networks. It specifically reports on the relationship between the tourism interest groups and government, and the mechanisms used by them to influence policy development. The paper shows that the tourism policy network can be characterised as immature. It has government at its centre directing strategic policy, with two sub-networks concentrating on the detail of commercial tourism and tourism resource policy. Within these sub-networks are dominant and secondary players defined as such by the manner in which they use their resources, gain access to decision-makers, collaborate with like-minded groups and work with government bureaucracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nielsen, Poul A.</author><author>Moynihan, Donald P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How Do Politicians Attribute Bureaucratic Responsibility for Performance?

Inattention to this question renders incomplete current perspectives on democratic processes of accountability, even as politicians are increasingly provided with performance data to hold bureaucrats accountable. We shed light on this issue using a survey experiment of elected officials featuring actual performance data. We find that the provision of performance data makes elected officials more willing to attribute causal responsibility to bureaucratic leaders, but only in cases of low performance, suggesting a negativity bias in public sector responsibility attribution processes. Additionally, we offer evidence that interest group advocates influence how elected officials use performance information to attribute responsibility, but contingent on ideological alignment.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cook, Jeffrey J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The States Come Marching In: Examining State Agency Influence on Federal Rules</title><secondary-title>Review of Policy Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Review of Policy Research</full-title></periodical><pages>378-394</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>environment</keyword><keyword>national governance</keyword><keyword>pollution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/ropr.12334</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Amidst congressional gridlock, administrative rulemaking is the main pathway for environmental policy making. Scholars have assessed the role of the institutions of government (the president, Congress, and the courts) and key interest groups (i.e., business and environmental interests) in shaping rulemaking outcomes. What is missing from this literature is an assessment of the role of key implementers, state environmental agencies. This research fills this gap by assessing the role and impact of state government agencies in three case studies of rulemaking at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Based on original interviews and a public comment analysis, this research suggests that state agencies play an active and influential role in EPA rulemaking. And, in some cases, state agencies wield more influence than other interest groups. Interviewees argued that this influence stems from these agencies’ unique voice as an implementation collaborator. As a result, researchers should incorporate an assessment of the role of these interests to more effectively explain regulatory outcomes at the EPA and potentially across the bureaucracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Egerod, Benjamin C.

This article theorizes and quantifies the indirect form of influence that competing lobbying actors exert on each other. While existing theories of competitive lobbying have focused on legislation, we argue that all stages of the lobbying process involve competition. Our findings make two contributions to the study of lobbying influence. First, using spatial econometrics, we present the first estimates of how the success of one lobbying actor is shaped by the lobbying activities of opposing actors. Second, we study competition in three diverse empirical settings that capture three different stages of the lobbying process: (1) lobbying camps favoring opposite legislative outcomes in five European countries, (2) US lobbying firms competing over client resources, and (3) corporations competing for administrative trade barriers in 19 World Trade Organization member countries. The results reveal important insights about how interdependence among lobbyists conditions their effectiveness. Our application of spatial techniques to model interdependence between actors is useful for all scholars who want to take competitive or collaborative diffusion mechanisms into account in studies of lobbying and public policy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schottland, Charles Irwing</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Warren, Roland l.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Federal agencies, national associations, and the politics of welfare</title><secondary-title>Politics and African-American Ghettos</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Politics and African-American Ghettos</full-title></periodical><pages>142-164</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>New York</pub-location><publisher>Routledge</publisher><isbn>9781351498555</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4324/9781315126784</electronic-resource-num><notes>not available</notes><research-notes>not available</research-notes><urls/><label>US</label><abstract>Even those who were the most uninformed and uninterested in the “politics of welfare�?, became interested and many became involved in the politics which surrounded the passage of the Social Security Amendments of 1967.

They are, national voluntary association as promoter and reformer; national associations as partners of federal bureaucracy; national voluntary associations in the legislative arena; national voluntary associations in the administrative and fund allocation process; national associations as the antagonists of federal agencies; national associations as supporters of federal agencies; national associations as initiators of social policy or programs; and national associations as representatives of special interest groups.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carlsen, Kirsten</author><author>Hansen, Christian P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rent-seeking and timber rights allocation in Ghana</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>537-548</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Forest Law Enforcement</keyword><keyword>bureaucratic corruption</keyword><keyword>competitive biding</keyword><keyword>governance and trade (FLEGT)</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>political corruption</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>COMMONWEALTH FORESTRY ASSOC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1505/146554814814095375</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CARLSEN HANSEN Lobbying and Bureaucratic Corruption 2014.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Ghana</label><abstract>This paper describes types, processes and importance of rent-seeking in the allocation of timber rights in Ghana. It is based on an analysis of 30 interviews with large-, medium- and small-scale timber firms, as well as government officials and timber industry organizations in Ghana. The paper documents that timber rights allocation is associated with both bureaucratic and political corruption. The latter comes in two forms. First, the findings suggest that well-established relationships exist between politicians and senior bureaucrats on the one side and large-scale timber firms on the other involving exchange of timber rights for political support and/or material, personal benefits. Second, timber rights are allocated to persons or firms outside the timber sector allegedly as payment for political support. The paper concludes that the Voluntary Partnership Agreement between Ghana and the EU is likely to reduce the observed practises in the future through increased transparency.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bradley, Katharine W.

We theorise and test a specific mechanism by which bureaucrats attempt to sway legislative outcomes, which we term indirect bureaucratic lobbying. Using a novel survey of state-based health lobbyists in 25 states, we show that state Medicaid agency staff routinely request lobbying assistance from provider associations and consumer advocates. We also provide the first systematic evidence of the conditions under which indirect bureaucratic lobbying is likely to occur. Our results suggest that individual-level policy agreement interacts with institutional factors, most notably agency performance and gubernatorial power, to increase the likelihood that bureaucrats will use this strategy to attempt to influence legislative deliberations.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yamamoto, Hidehiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest group politics and its transformation in Japan: An approach informed by longitudinal survey data</title><secondary-title>Asian Survey</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Asian Survey</full-title></periodical><pages>532-557</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Japanese politics</keyword><keyword>interest group</keyword><keyword>longitudinal survey</keyword><keyword>political influence</keyword><keyword>political reform</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1525/AS.2021.61.3.532</electronic-resource-num><notes>Not available </notes><research-notes>Not available </research-notes><urls/><label>Japan</label><abstract>The political reforms that have been going on since the 1990s have drastically changed the face of politics in Japan.

These changes were expected to change the power structure by altering the contact of interest groups with political elites. I examine this issue based on a longitudinal survey conducted in four rounds between 1997 and 2017. The results show a robust structure of interest group politics, although the features were weakening. That is, contacts with the LDP and the bureaucracy were sources of political influence for interest groups.

Our empirical focus is on the Dutch interest group system for which we examine how coalitions among groups and the network position of interest groups within and between such coalitions shape access. The analysis, based on data collected among 107 Dutch interest groups and 28 policymakers, leads to the conclusion that network positions count differently for elected and non-elected officials, and that network ties that bridge different coalitions add significant explanatory leverage to resource-based explanations of access. © Cambridge University Press 2013.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jacobsen, Dag Ingvar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LOCAL AUTHORITY BUREAUCRACIES: RESPONSIBLE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR DIVERGENT?

In fact, many reforms in the public sector aim to strengthen control over these bureaucracies, either by politicians or by citizens. This article argues that the need for control will depend on the degree of interest divergence between bureaucracy on the one hand, and politicians and citizens on the other. Still, attitudes in the three groups are seldom compared directly. Here, the attitudes towards different issues in the three groups are compared, within four small Norwegian municipalities. The results indicate that attitudes of local bureaucrats only to a limited degree diverge from those of politicians and the public, with one exception: attitudes towards so-called `New Public Management' reforms.

Physicians' discontent stems from the belief that federal policy allows managed care organizations to achieve dominance in health care markets just as it discourages physicians from taking collective action to protect their interests. This article examines two important efforts by organized medicine over a twenty-year interval to alter federal antitrust policy. In 1982, physicians and other professionals sought a special exemption from FTC jurisdiction; beginning in 1998, physicians promoted legislation that would exempt independent practitioners from the antitrust laws for collective bargaining purposes. Both initiatives passed in the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate. This article uses an advocacy coalition framework to reinterpret the events and to assess the reasons for legislative failure. The evidence suggests that in both instances, although twenty years apart, consumer groups and federal bureaucrats determined the outcome in favor of corporate medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Farhang, Sean</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Public regulation and private lawsuits in the American separation of powers system</title><secondary-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>821-839</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00345.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://FAHRANG Public Regulation and Private Lawsuits 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>This article investigates causes of the legislative choice to mobilize private litigants to enforce statutes. It specifies the statutory mechanism, grounded in economic incentives, that Congress uses to do so, and presents a theoretical framework for understanding how certain characteristics of separation of powers structures, particularly conflict between Congress and the president over control of the bureaucracy, drive legislative production of this mechanism. Using new and original historical data, the article presents the first empirical model of the legislative choice to mobilize private litigants, covering the years 1887 to 2004. The findings provide robust support for the proposition that interbranch conflict between Congress and the president is a powerful cause of congressional enactment of incentives to mobilize private litigants. Higher risk of electoral losses by the majority party, Democratic control of Congress, and demand by issue-oriented interest groups are also significant predictors of congressional enactment of such incentives.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sunam, Ramesh</author><author>Pariyar, Bishnu</author><author>Shrestha, Krishna K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does affirmative action undermine meritocracy? ``Meritocratic inclusion'' of the marginalized in Nepal's bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW</full-title></periodical><volume>40</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Dalit</keyword><keyword>Nepal</keyword><keyword>affirmative action</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>equality</keyword><keyword>meritocracy</keyword><keyword>social inclusion</keyword><keyword>social justice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/dpr.12554</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SUNAM ET AL Affirmative Action Meritocracy Bureaucracy 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Nepal;representative bureaucracy</label><abstract>Motivation Affirmative action policies have attracted significant academic and policy interest worldwide. One of the key criticisms of such policies is that they undermine meritocratic principles, but there is little evidence and analysis on how such policies are being implemented and shape meritocracy, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Purpose Drawing on a case study of an affirmative action policy designed for the inclusion of members from marginalized groups in Nepal's civil service, the article critically examines whether this erodes meritocracy and productivity. Methods and approach The article draws on empirical insights and data collected through a critical policy analysis, complemented by surveys and interviews with civil servants benefitted from affirmative action and other civil servants, including policy analysts and public intellectuals. Findings Our findings challenge a narrative that affirmative action in the form of reservations or quotas erodes meritocracy and reduces the quality of public services. Rather, we argue that an affirmative action policy can enrich meritocracy by addressing its inherent deficits, including its blindness to horizontal inequalities and forms of social exclusion, which tend to sustain the monopolization of bureaucracy by a dominant group in an already unequal society. Policy implications Reconceptualizing an affirmative action policy applied in Nepal's civil service as a tool of ``meritocratic inclusion,'' we argue that it rewards competence and promotes workforce diversity and social justice. Our evidence suggests that affirmative action, when it is carefully designed, can be an effective policy tool both to enhance representative bureaucracy and enrich meritocracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazey, Sonia</author><author>Richardson, Jeremy</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hayward, Jack</author><author>Menon, Anand</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest Groups and the Brussels Bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>Governing Europe</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Governing Europe</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Europe</keyword><keyword>European Community Law</keyword><keyword>European democracy</keyword><keyword>European governance</keyword><keyword>European politics</keyword><keyword>Western Europe</keyword><keyword>core executives</keyword><keyword>democracy</keyword><keyword>governance</keyword><keyword>institutions</keyword><keyword>national courts</keyword><keyword>organized interests</keyword><keyword>political parties</keyword><keyword>politics</keyword><keyword>popular participation</keyword><keyword>public administration</keyword><keyword>public policy</keyword><keyword>public protest</keyword><keyword>social policy</keyword><keyword>the state</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><pub-location>Oxford</pub-location><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><isbn>9780191599439</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/0199250154.003.0013</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MAZEI RICHARDSON Lobbying EU 2003.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>The chapter first discusses the logic of lobbying of the European Commission by interest groups. The rest of the discussion is divided into three parts. The first section highlights the organizational and cultural characteristics of the Commission bureaucracy and the implications of these characteristics for groups seeking to develop effective lobbying strategies. The second section examines in detail recent attempts by the Commission to structure and institutionalize interest group consultation; this analysis highlights the increasing importance of both 'thin' and 'thick' consultative structures. The concluding section briefly considers the utility and limitations of group pluralism within the Commission and asks whether the neo-functionalist predictions have, in the event, turned out to be surprisingly accurate.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ban, Pamela</author><author>You, Hye Young</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presence and influence in lobbying: Evidence from Dodd-Frank</title><secondary-title>BUSINESS AND POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BUSINESS AND POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>267-295</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>rulemaking</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/bap.2018.27</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BAN YO Presence and Influence in Lobbying 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Interest groups face many choices when lobbying: when, who, and how to lobby. We study interest group lobbying across two stages of regulatory policymaking: the congressional and agency rulemaking stages. We investigate how the Securities and Exchange Commission responds to interest groups at the end of these stages using a new, comprehensive lobbying dataset on the Dodd-Frank Act. Our approach examines citations in the SEC's final rules which reference and acknowledge the lobbying activities of specific interest groups. We find that more than 2,900 organizations engaged in different types of lobbying activities either during the congressional bill stage, the agency rulemaking stage, or both. Meetings with the SEC and hiring former SEC employees are strongly associated with the citation of an organization in a final rule. Comments submitted by trade associations and members of Congress are cited more in a final rule compared to other organizations. While there is more variety in the types of organizations who lobby the bureaucracy than those who lobby Congress, presence does not necessarily lead to recognition or influence.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rosser, Andrew</author><author>Roesad, Kurnya</author><author>Edwin, Donni</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Indonesia: The politics of inclusion</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA</full-title></periodical><pages>53-77</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00472330580000041</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ROSSER ET AL Indonesia Politics of Inclusion 2005.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Indonesia</label><abstract>Much commentary on Indonesian politics since the fall of President Suharto in May 1998 has suggested that Indonesia's political system has remained just as exclusionary as it was prior to his fall, despite becoming much more democratic and decentralised. In contrast to this view, we argue that Indonesia's political system has become more inclusive, if only somewhat more so. The fall of Suharto and the subsequent process of democratisation have removed key obstacles to organisation by poor and disadvantaged groups and their NGO allies, making it easier for them to engage in collective action aimed at achieving pro-poor policy change. By making attainment of political office dependent on the support of the voting public, many of whom are poor and disadvantaged, these developments have also created an incentive for politicians to pursue policy changes that favour these groups or at least that appeal to them. At the same time, however, we argue that poor and disadvantaged groups have not become major players in the policy-making process. Despite the fall of Suharto and democratisation, these groups continue to lack the resources possessed by other participants in the policy-making process. Whereas the politico-bureaucrats and well-connected business groups have been able to exercise influence over policy by buying support within representative bodies such as parliament and mobile capital controllers, the IFIs and Western governments have been able to exercise influence by virtue of their structural power, poor and disadvantaged groups have had to rely on less potent ways of exercising influence such as holding demonstrations, engaging in lobbying activity and participating in public debates. We illustrate these points with reference to two policy issues: land reform and mining in protected forests. The article concludes by considering the future prospects for inclusive policy-making in Indonesia.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ritchie, Melinda N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Back-Channel Representation: A Study of the Strategic Communication of Senators with the US Department of Labor</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>240-253</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Congress</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>polic</keyword><keyword>separation of powers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>UNIV CHICAGO PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/694395</electronic-resource-num><notes>Text not available - Requested through Research Gate</notes><research-notes>Text not available - Requested through Research Gate</research-notes><urls/><label>US</label><abstract>An underappreciated way members of Congress represent interests is by pursuing policy goals through their communication with the bureaucracy. I argue that the bureaucracy provides an alternative, covert way for cross-pressured legislators, who face diverging pressures from party leaders, interest groups, and subconstituencies, to satisfy conflicting interests. Using original data of senators' communication with the US Department of Labor from 2005 to 2012 (109th through 112th Congresses), I show that, when faced with cross-pressures from party and constituency, senators strategically choose less visible, back-channel means for pursuing policy goals. These findings provide a new perspective on representation by demonstrating that legislators pursue policy goals outside of the legislative process in an effort to evade accountability.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Jiaqi</author><author>Park, Sanghee</author><author>Zhao, Tianshu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Representative Bureaucracy, Distributional Equity, and Environmental Justice</title><secondary-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>402-414</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/puar.13160</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LIANG ET AL Representative Bureaucracy 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US;representative bureaucracy</label><abstract>This article explores the role of bureaucratic representation and distributional equity in the implementation of environmental policy, which has been shaped by the politics of identity, administrative discretion, and a contested discourse on the redistribution of public resources. The authors examine whether minority bureaucratic representation fosters policy outputs for race-related disadvantaged communities and whether the behavior of public administrators reflects distributional equity. Linking representative bureaucracy to environmental justice, this research contributes to the understanding of social equity in public administration and sheds light on the relationship between bureaucratic representation and democratic values. Analyzing a nationwide, block-group-level data set, the authors find that a more racially representative workforce in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promotes the agency's enforcement actions in communities that have large local-national disparities in minority populations and severe policy problems. The size of the bureaucratic representation effect is larger for neighborhoods that are overburdened with race-related social vulnerability. Evidence for Practice Public administrators can play a critical role in representing the general public, particularly those who have historically been marginalized and underserved, and acting in their interests. Non-service-oriented regulatory agencies have taken equity into account in the process of implementing policies and serving socially vulnerable clients. Public administrators need to be cognizant of the degree of preexisting inequity in local communities, acquire adequate information to ascertain the equity point, and devise public policies and programs to achieve various democratic values. It is important to recruit more underrepresented and historically disadvantaged members of society into the public workforce.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martin, Cathie Jo</author><author>Swank, Duane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GONNA PARTY LIKE IT'S 1899 Party Systems and the Origins of Varieties of Coordination</title><secondary-title>WORLD POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WORLD POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>78+</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0043887110000298</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MARTIN SWANK Party Systems and Coordination 2011.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>political institutions</label><abstract>This article explores the origins of peak employers' associations to understand why countries produce highly centralized macrocorporatist groups, weaker national associations but stronger industry-level groups, or highly fragmented pluralist associations. The authors suggest that the structure of partisan competition played a vital causal role in the development and evolution of these peak associations. The leadership for peak employers' association development came from business-oriented party activists and bureaucrats, who sought both to advance industrial development policy and to solve specific problems of political control. Business-oriented party leaders and bureaucrats in both predemocratic and democratic regimes feared the rising tide of democracy and labor activism and viewed employer organization as a useful tool for political control, to secure parliamentary advantage, and to serve as a societal counterweight to working-class activism. Because leadership for association building came from the state, the political rules of the game were crucial to outcomes. The structure of party competition and state centralization shaped incentives for strategic coordination for both political actors and employers. Dedicated business parties were more likely to develop in countries with multiparty systems and limited federal power sharing than in countries with two-party systems and federalism: in a multiparty context where no single party was likely to gain power, each party had an incentive to cooperate with other social groups. Moreover, business-oriented party leaders and bureaucrats in multiparty systems were motivated to delegate policy-making authority to coordinated societal channels for industrial relations, because they anticipated that employers would win more in these channels than in parliamentary settings where the center and left could form a coalition against the right. Again, centralized party systems were more likely than federal ones to develop a dedicated national business party that transcended regional cleavages and to retain a strong role for the state in the governance of industrial relations.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boehmke, Frederick J.</author><author>Gailmard, Sean</author><author>Patty, John W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Business as usual: Interest group access and representation across policy-making venues</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>3-33</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>legislature</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0143814X12000207</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BOEHMKE GAILMARD PATTY Business as usual IG Representantion 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>We provide the first comprehensive study of lobbying across venues by studying interest group registrations in both the legislative and administrative branches. We present four major findings based on Federal and state data. Firstly, groups engage in substantial administrative lobbying relative to legislative lobbying. Secondly, the vast majority of groups lobby the legislature, but a large proportion of groups also lobby the bureaucracy. Thirdly, representational biases in legislative lobbying are replicated across venues: business groups dominate administrative lobbying at least as much as they do legislative lobbying. Finally, the level of interest group activity in one venue for a given policy area is strongly related to its level in the other venue. The findings potentially have important implications for the impact of institutional design on both the form and promotion of broad participation in policy-making as well as the ultimate content of policies chosen by democratic governments, broadly construed.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sorge, Marco Maria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying (strategically appointed) bureaucrats</title><secondary-title>CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY</full-title></periodical><pages>171-189</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucratic lobbying</keyword><keyword>legislative delegation</keyword><keyword>strategic appointments</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>SPRINGER</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10602-014-9178-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SORGE Lobbying (strategically appointed) bureaucrats 2015.pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://Sorge - 2015 - Lobbying (strategically appointed) bureaucrats.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>When are strategic appointments useful in curbing policy bias from ex-post negotiation between state agencies and special interest groups? Bertelli and Feldmann (J Public Adm Res Theory 17: 19-38, 2007) provide an insightful analysis of the issue within a full information model of presidential appointments. This paper examines whether and how their findings extend to a world of policy uncertainty and asymmetric information, which rationalizes delegation in the first place. We establish that the occurrence of policy-relevant equilibrium lobbying crucially relies on interest groups' leverage over the appointment game between higher-level institutions. Remarkably, bureaucratic lobbying may prove highly non-neutral with separated powers even when a candidate agency is agreed upon. In some circumstances (e.g., recess appointments in the US), by contrast, strategic appointments fully offset interest group influence in either form of government (unified versus divided), a finding in line with the conventional theory of delegation.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Espeland, Wendy N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bureaucratizing democracy, democratizing bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>Law and Social Inquiry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Law and Social Inquiry</full-title></periodical><pages>1077-1109</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1747-4469.2000.tb00317.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ESPELAND Bureaucratizing Democracy 2000.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>This article analyzes the relationship between how rationality is conceived and how democracy is practiced in the Bureau of Reclamation, a water development agency in the Department of Interior.

It is argued that as `socially embedded actors', the group of `mediating bureaucrats' are in a position to translate and mediate between diverse and sometimes conflicting interests and aspirations of the state, the government and business. We use the rehabilitation of the sugar industry in Mozambique to show how mediating bureaucrats adopted two practices - muddling through and translation - in order to straddle conflicting interests during different reform initiatives in post-independence Mozambique.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aberbach, Joel D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The U.S. Federal Executive in an Era of Change</title><secondary-title>GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION</full-title></periodical><pages>373-399</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><publisher>BLACKWELL PUBLISHERS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1468-0491.00221</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ABERBACH The US Federal Executive in an Era of Change 2003.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US;profile of top civil servants</label><abstract>This article examines changes in the background characteristics, attitudes, and behavior patterns of high-level U.S. federal executives. It also considers the impact of the New Public Management (NPM) movement. The data indicate that despite intense struggles about the role of the public sector, top civil servants remain a well-educated, experienced, and highly motivated group, the members of which compare favorably to top executives in the private sector. The data also suggest that the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978 has been effective in producing a more politically responsive corps of career civil servants, and that administrators (both career and noncareer) are increasingly attuned to the more technical and legal aspects of their roles and less oriented to protecting particular interests or clientele groups. NPM-style changes are still in progress and remain controversial, but it appears that political leaders continue to have an excellent (and increasingly diverse) group of career people to work with and a system that-at least in part due to the CSRA reforms-is more responsive to them than before. The top part of the U.S. bureaucracy may have been bent and reshaped in many ways over the last thirty years, but, despite widely publicized fears, it has not broken.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McKay, Amy M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The decision to lobby bureaucrats</title><secondary-title>Public Choice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Choice</full-title></periodical><pages>123-138</pages><volume>147</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>congress</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>policymaking</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11127-010-9607-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MCKAY The decision to lobby bureaucrats 2011.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Despite a good deal of interest in lobbyists' tactics, virtually no research has been published examining the conditions under which interest groups lobby the bureaucracy rather than or in addition to the legislature.

Results: Our analysis reveals that while there are many reasons to expect lobbying Congress to produce valuable contracts, we instead find that it is the direct lobbying of executive branch agencies that is most likely to bring big rewards.

Yet, much of this literature focuses on representation at a single point in time. In this article, we propose a more dynamic perspective. In terms of theory, we postulate specific temporal relationships between triggering cues (e.g., a crisis event) and the representation decisions of civil servants. We specify two complementary mechanisms underlying these relationships: that is, a sensemaking process whereby the perceived meaning and relative salience of distinct groups and interests changes over time; and a shift in bureaucrats' discretion to represent specific groups or interests changes over time. We illustrate these time-dependent processes using interview and survey data from the European Commission.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsai, Wen-Hsuan</author><author>Zhou, Wang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrated Fragmentation and the Role of Leading Small Groups in Chinese Politics</title><secondary-title>CHINA JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CHINA JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>1-22</pages><volume>82</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>UNIV CHICAGO PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/700670</electronic-resource-num><notes>CCP 19th Congress - Prospects on Power Structure and Policies, Taipei,

This article analyzes the roles of the three main actors in the leading small groups: group leaders, the heads of the lead departments, and the office directors. We discuss how these individuals operate through formal institutional approaches and informal political channels. Group politics of this kind is moving China's decision-making process toward ``integrated fragmentation.'' We conclude that compared with previous Chinese regimes, Xi Jinping is making greater use of leading small groups to promote further reforms and to practice individualized centralization.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Döhler, Marian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Law Drafting by Contract - Government, Ministerial Bureaucracy and the Problem of External Advice in the Lawmaking Process</title><secondary-title>POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT</full-title></periodical><pages>181-210</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>external advisors</keyword><keyword>government capacity</keyword><keyword>lawmaking</keyword><keyword>policy formulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>SPRINGER</publisher><notes>Not found</notes><research-notes>Not found</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DÖHLER Law Drafting by Contract Ministerial Bureaucracy 2012.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Germany</label><abstract>It has been accepted for a long time that ministries use external support during the lawmaking process. When the Ministry of Economics delegated the drafting of an entire bill to a private law firm, concerns about governmental capacity and an intransparent route of access for special interests have been raised. The empirical analysis of delegated law drafting and temporary employment of experts, seconded from business firms and interest groups to ministries, shows that both phenomena remain small in scale and therefore of limited impact. By looking at the reasons why there is a ``law drafting by contract'' at all, it is revealed that not all German ministries are sufficiently staffed with qualified personnel to deal with more complex and innovative subjects of legislation. Given the high expectations which are addressed at government sovereignty during the lawmaking process, this appears as an unresolved problem of policy-making in the German political system.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balla, Steven J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political and organizational determinants of bureaucratic responsiveness</title><secondary-title>American Politics Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Politics Research</full-title></periodical><pages>163-193</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1532673X00028002002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BALLA Bureaucratic Responsiveness 2000.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>This article examines the responsiveness of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to contacts initiated by members of Congress, interest groups, and private citizens. I develop and test hypotheses regarding the importance of internal bureaucratic factors (e.g., workload) and external political forces (e.g., contactor characteristics). Although previous research, which focuses on urban service bureaucracies, indicates that procedurally neutral rules related to agency missions are the primary predictors of responsiveness, I demonstrate that political considerations exerted substantial influence over HCFA responsiveness. For example, the agency was in some ways more responsive to congressional contacts than to contacts initiated by groups and citizens. These results suggest that scholars of legislative-executive relations should pay more attention to contacts as these routine, ongoing encounters may affect the extent to which bureaucratic policy choices are consistent with the preferences of elected officials and their constituents.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McKay, Amy M.</author><author>Yackee, Susan Webb</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest group competition on federal agency rules</title><secondary-title>AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>336-357</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>agency rulemaking</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>competitive lobbying</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>organized interests</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1532673X06296571</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MCKAY YACKEE Interest Group Competition Federal Agencies 2007.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>In the lobbying literature, the effects of competition-two or more interests lobbying on opposing sides of a policy debate-have not been assessed with regard to government agency policymaking. Consequently, neither the amount nor the effect of competitive lobbying is well understood. Using nearly 1,700 comments on 40 federal agency rules, we evaluate two questions: Do government agencies respond to lobbying by changing agency policies? and Does lobbying on one side of a policy issue beget lobbying on the opposing side? We demonstrate that agencies change the content of final rules in favor of the side that dominates the submission of comments. Thus, it seems the ``squeaky wheel gets the grease'' during rulemaking. We find no evidence, however, of counteractive lobbying during agency rulemaking. Our results suggest that interest groups may further their policy goals by observing more closely the actions of opposing groups during agency policymaking.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazza, Isidoro</author><author>Winden, Frans Van</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An endogenous policy model of hierarchical government</title><secondary-title>EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>133-149</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>endogenous policymaking</keyword><keyword>fiscal federalism</keyword><keyword>hierarchy</keyword><keyword>multi-tier lobbying</keyword><keyword>multilevel government</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.euroecorev.2007.05.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MAZZA WINDEN Endogenous Policy Model 2007.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Endogenous policy models usually neglect that government policies are frequently the result of decisions taken at different tiers by different agents, each enjoying some degree of autonomy. In this paper, policies are the outcome of the choices made by two agents within a hierarchy. A legislator decides on the budget to be successively spent by a bureaucrat. Both agents are lobbied by one or two interest groups. The combination of sequential decisionmaking and lobbying implies that the interaction between the agent at one tier and,the interest group(s) depends on the exchange between the same interest group(s) and the agent at the other tier. Our results concerning multi-tier lobbying and legislatorial oversight substantially qualify the conventional wisdom related to one-tier lobbying. In particular, the reaction of the legislator to lobbying at the bureaucratic tier may make lobbying wasteful even when there is no competition from other lobbies. Moreover, the legislator benefits from lobbying only when there is competition between interest groups at the upper tier. It is also shown that competition for influence at the bureaucratic tier may work as a perfect substitute for legislatorial oversight. Extensions of the model indicate its usefulness for the analysis of decisionmaking in other multilevel governance structures, like federations or firms.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eggert, Hakan</author><author>Kataria, Mitesh</author><author>Lampi, Elina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Difference in Preferences or Multiple Preference Orderings?

We study preferences for environmental policy using a choice experiment (CE) on three populations; the general public, Swedish EPA bureaucrats, and recreational anglers. We also test for existence of multiple preference orderings: Half of the respondents were asked to choose the alternatives that best corresponded with their opinion, and the other half was asked to take the role of a policy-maker and make recommendations for environmental policy. The SEPA bureaucrats have the highest marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) to improve environmental quality. Differences in MWTP are robust and not due to differences in socio-economic characteristics across the populations.

In 1992, Banks and Weingast argued that bureaucrats hold an informational advantage vis-à-vis political principals concerning policy-relevant variables, and that when it is prohibitively costly to audit, the agency may over- or understate the extent of a public problem. This is less likely to happen if there is a low-cost monitoring technology and if interest groups can monitor the agency's choices. I test this hypothesis using data on bureaucratic statements that estimate the importance of a number of hazardous waste problems from a group of state-level environmental agencies. The results provide evidence for the Banks-Weingast hypothesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Ching-Ping</author><author>Tang, Shui-Yan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Democratizing bureaucracy - The political economy of environmental impact assessment and air pollution prevention fees in Taiwan</title><secondary-title>COMPARATIVE POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>COMPARATIVE POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>81+</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><publisher>CITY UNIV NEW YORK</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/422425</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TANG TANG Democratizing Bureaucracy 2000.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Taiwan</label><abstract>Although many institutional obstacles for civic participation have remained in Taiwan, a decade of democratization has created more opportunities for environmental activists to influence policymaking.

We theorize lobbying venue choices and intensity as a function of contract enforceability with policy makers, politicians, or bureaucrats. We argue that organizational structures of interest groups, in particular, whether they are centralized or decentralized, substantially affect their lobbying strategies because they are associated with different ability to monitor and enforce contracts with policy makers and punish them when they fail. We further demonstrate that the effect of centralized versus decentralized structure on venue choices is conditional on the types of electoral system: majoritarian, semiproportional (single, nontransferable vote: SNTV), or proportional representation systems. We test this argument using longitudinal survey data on lobbying which span two decades and cover around 250 interest groups in various sectors and issue areas in Japan. The results lend strong support to our argument about contract enforceability under alternative electoral systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carpenter, Daniel</author><author>Judge-Lord, Devin</author><author>Libgober, Brian</author><author>Rashin, Steven</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Data and methods for analyzing special interest influence in rulemaking</title><secondary-title>INTEREST GROUPS &amp; ADVOCACY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTEREST GROUPS &amp; ADVOCACY</full-title></periodical><pages>425-435</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>3, SI</issue><keywords><keyword>Bureaucrati</keyword><keyword>Interest groups</keyword><keyword>Lobbying</keyword><keyword>Rulemaking</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1057/s41309-020-00094-w</electronic-resource-num><notes>not available</notes><research-notes>not available</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CARPENTER ET AL Data and Methods IG Influence 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>The US government creates astonishingly complete records of policy creation in executive agencies.

Its key assumption is that a bureaucrat's demography shapes her pre-organizational socialization, values, and ultimately her decisions, in a way that can advance the interests of a represented client or group (i.e., active representation). However, scholars have not critically examined the presumed links among these four factors. We review the literature and make an argument for representative bureaucracy scholars to incorporate a psychological perspective to better understand the behavioral mechanisms that influence active representation. We discuss the tripartite classification of the mind, dual-process theories of decision making, identity theory and the deservingness heuristic as theoretical perspectives scholars can use to investigate the behavioral foundations of representative bureaucracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Binderkrantz, Anne S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest group strategies: Navigating between privileged access and strategies of pressure</title><secondary-title>Political Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Political Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>694-715</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1467-9248.2005.00552.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BINDERKRANTZ Interest Group Strategies 2005.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Denmark;interest group strategies</label><abstract>The literature often contrasts interest groups possessing insider status and outsider groups forced to seek influence through more indirect means. Drawing on data from a survey of all national Danish interest groups, this article demonstrates that most groups have an action repertoire including both direct contacts to bureaucrats and parliamentarians and indirect activities such as media campaigns and mobilizations of members. Different strategies of influence are correlated positively, hence, there is no contradiction between pursuing strategies associated with insider access to decision-making and strategies where pressure is put on decision makers through media contacts and mobilizations. An analysis of four distinct strategies - an administrative, a parliamentary, a media and a mobilization strategy - finds interesting variations in the factors that affect the pursuance of the various strategies of influence. Groups with a privileged position vis-à-vis decision makers have high levels of activities targeting these decision makers, but the lack of a privileged position does not lead groups to pursue indirect strategies. Indirect strategies are most intensively pursued by cause groups and groups who find themselves in a competitive situation with regard to attracting members. © Political Studies Association, 2005.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chalmers, Adam William</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Getting a Seat at the Table: Capital, Capture and Expert Groups in the European Union</title><secondary-title>WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>976-992</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR &amp; FRANCIS LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01402382.2013.852832</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CHALMERS Capital, Capture and Expert Groups in the European Union 2014.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>European Commission expert groups provide powerful platforms from which interest organisations can steer the EU consultation process and weigh in on policy outcomes. Commission decision-makers and bureaucrats rely heavily on expert groups to provide expert policy advice on highly technical issues in the early stages of the policymaking process. Interest organisations provide this advice in order to have their voices heard at the EU level. But whose interests are being represented in these expert groups? Which types of interest organisations, in other words, get a seat at the table and why? This article, using data on over 800 expert groups and nearly 3,000 interest organisations, argues that expert group membership is largely a function of superior resources, EU-level interests and existing institutionalised ties to decision-makers. Far from simply addressing the Commission's need for expertise, expert group membership is more a story of capital and capture.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kerwin, Cornelius</author><author>Furlong, Scott R.</author><author>West, William</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Durand, Robert F.</author><author>Edwards III, George C.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest Groups, Rulemaking, and American Bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>The Oxford Handbook of American Bureaucracy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Oxford Handbook of American Bureaucracy</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>American bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>Congress</keyword><keyword>Washington</keyword><keyword>agency rulemaking</keyword><keyword>courts</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>presidency</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>Oxford</pub-location><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><isbn>9780191594694</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238958.003.0025</electronic-resource-num><notes>text not available - requested through Research Gate</notes><research-notes>text not available - requested through Research Gate</research-notes><urls/><label>US</label><abstract>This article first outlines the major indirect sources and pathways of influence that interest groups use outside and within the administrative process to influence agency rulemaking.

This article shows that autonomous bureaucracy, while useful for fending off the politics of interest groups, is not free of politics in itself. Using Chinese industrial policy-making as a strategic case study, this article uncovers the competitive dimension of bureaucratic decision-making and the extent to which it serves as a driving force for industrial policy paradigm change in China. Equipped with a theory of policy articulation, this article details the strategies used by multiple superagencies and groups of career bureaucrats to vie for industrial policy authority within the Chinese state. In sum, this article seeks to expose the role of intrabureaucracy competition in mediating international political economic environment and national policy outcomes. Looking forward, this article proposes that the renewed focus on industrial policy by many national governments compels an analytical re-engagement with the role of large bureaucracies in economic decision-making and the kind of organizational and cognitive frameworks by which bureaucrats mobilize to chart our industrial landscapes.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laurens, Sylvain</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Les Eurodéputés assiégés par le lobbys?</title><secondary-title>La Pensée</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>La Pensée</full-title></periodical><pages>7-17</pages><volume>389</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LAURENS Eurodéputés assiégés lobbys 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>Usually, Brussels lobbyists are seen as shadowy men in the corridors of the European Parliament, trying to influence elected MEPs before they take decisive political decisions.

Finally, new directions in regulatory policymaking are explored, including data collection advancements, as well as the potential role for guidance documents as replacements for more traditionally issued notice and comment regulations.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beyers, Jan</author><author>Kerremans, Bart</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bureaucrats, politicians, and societal interests: How is European policy making politicized?</title><secondary-title>Comparative Political Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Comparative Political Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>1119-1150</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>EU-institutions</keyword><keyword>access networks</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>political cleavages</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0010414004269828</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BEYERS KERREMANS Bureaucrats Politicians and Societal Interests 2004.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>EU</label><abstract>Often it is argued that the EU depoliticizes political issues as bureaucrats and nonmajoritarian institutions are key in the policy-making process. However, recent research rejects this perspective and shows that domestic political cleavages organize the European political space. This article demonstrates that (a) political cleavages affect the organization of policy networks among Euro-level bureaucrats, politicians, and societal interests; and (b) that the institutional organization of government facilitates the emergence of advocacy coalitions mobilizing these political cleavages. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the European political space is dominated by a cleavage between a progrowth coalition and a sustainability coalition. Furthermore, it shows that political officials occupy a pivotal position enabling them to mediate between these two coalitions. Finally, data on the actors' resource reputations suggest that in granting access, public officials attach considerable value to the public support coalitions enjoy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Simonaitytė, Vitalija</author><author>Šarkutė, Ligita</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest groups in the field of agricultural policy: Who are they and what do they do?</title><secondary-title>Public Policy and Administration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Policy and Administration</full-title></periodical><pages>266-284</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>agricultural policy</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>mapping interest groups</keyword><keyword>pressure strategies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.13165/VPA-20-19-2-09</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SIMONAITYTE SARKUTE Interest Groups Agriculture Bureaucracy 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Lithuania</label><abstract>This article analyses interest groups in the agricultural sector in Lithuania, and compares them with the rest of the population of interest groups across other sectors at the national level. The analysis is based on data from the International Comparative Interest Group Survey (CIGS). A survey of organizations representing various interests was carried out from September to November 2016, and covered all Lithuanian interest organizations operating at the national level. The survey was designed to clarify the development of these organizations, their daily activities, and their applied strategies, as well as identifying the challenges they face. In accordance with this study, the aim of this article is to identify the profile and specificity of interest groups in the field of agricultural policy. The data showed that the share of agricultural interest groups is one of the largest amongst the rest of the population of Lithuanian national interest groups, but the number of members of this sector's interest groups is lower than average. In the agricultural sector, interest groups are distinguished by the fact that they are clearly dominated by sectoral associations - one of the types of business groups. The Lithuanian agricultural interest organizations that were analysed apply both direct and indirect pressure strategies equally, but they are more likely than other organizations to contact the representatives of the state bureaucratic apparatus. These are predominantly bureaucrats working in ministries and ministers themselves, although it has to be mentioned that members of the Seimas were also frequently in contact with the Lithuanian agricultural interest organizations under study.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haider-Markel, Donald P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acting as fire alarms with law enforcement?

Given the significance of eligibility determination for policy and the fact that street-level bureaucrats have great latitude when interpreting eligibility standards, organized interests have an incentive to try to influence the application of eligibility rules. Despite this, few researchers have explored the impact of organized interests on eligibility determination. Using data from the Veterans' Disability Compensation (VDC) program, we examine how organized interests affect the implementation of eligibility-based programs. We emphasize the dual role of many organized interests as both traditional advocacy groups and service providers and use insight from the interest group and third-party service provider literature to formulate hypotheses. We find that veterans' groups affect variables capturing demand for, access to, and effective implementation of the VDC program, although we do not find effects for every measure of implementation included in our study.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Binderkrantz, Anne S.</author><author>Christiansen, Peter M.</author><author>Pedersen, Helene H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interest Group Access to the Bureaucracy, Parliament, and the Media</title><secondary-title>Governance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Governance</full-title></periodical><pages>95-112</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gove.12089</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BINDERKRANTZ ET AL Interest Group Access to the Bureaucracy Parliament Media 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Denmark</label><abstract>A key issue for interest groups and policymakers is the ways through which organized interests voice their interests and influence public policy. This article combines two perspectives on interest group representation to explain patterns of interest group access to different political arenas. From a resource exchange perspective, it argues that access to different political arenas is discrete as it is determined by the match between the supply and demands of interest groups and gatekeepers-politicians, bureaucrats, and reporters. From a partly competing perspective, it is argued that access is cumulative and converges around wealthy and professionalized groups. Based on a large-scale investigation of group presence in Danish political arenas, the analyses show a pattern of privileged pluralism. This describes a system where multiple political arenas provide opportunities for multiple interests but where unequally distributed resources produce cumulative effects (i.e., the same groups have high levels of arena access).</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Salka, Jaroslav</author><author>Dobsinska, Zuzana</author><author>Hricova, Zuzana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors of political power - The example of forest owners associations in Slovakia</title><secondary-title>FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS</full-title></periodical><pages>88-98</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>SI</issue><keywords><keyword>forest owners associations</keyword><keyword>forest policy</keyword><keyword>forestry</keyword><keyword>political power</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>ELSEVIER</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.forpol.2015.05.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SALKA ET AL Factors of political power Slovakia 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Slovakia</label><abstract>The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential of forest owners associations (FOAs) to influence forest policymaking using power theory. Firstly, the paper examines the concept of power and the political power of interest groups. Interest groups seek to be able to use their power through Influencing policy outcomes and framing the underlying dimensions that define policy issues. In the next step the paper defines factors of dispositional political power: formal, informal, internal, and external. Formal factors are primarily based constitutionally or legislatively and are ensured through the right to associate and form associations to advocate common interests. Informal factors represent the abilities of interest groups to operate in the political process. Internal factors represent the ability of interest groups to work within the group and external factors represent the behaviour towards other associations, government, non-governmental organisations, etc. Semi-structured questionnaires to former and present FOAs officials were used containing questions about the basic role of FOAs as they can be found in the scientific literature. The crucial internal factor limiting the dispositional power of FOAs is the lack of financial resources for providing services or necessary apparatus, which might strongly hinder the fulfilment and achievement of set goals in policymaking. The disinterest of the state bureaucracy towards non-state forests also limits FOAs' dispositional power. The most important external factor from the officials' perspective is the disinterest of the state bureaucracy towards non-state forests at the sectoral and cross-sectoral level. There is a common agreement between FOA officials that current strategies and tactics in the form of dialogue are inefficient. FOAs are considered as a partner in policy formulation, but their actual political power is low, due to the disunity among FOA leaders and ineffective strategies and tactics.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grandy, Jake B</author><author>Hiatt, Shon R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State Agency Discretion and Entrepreneurship in Regulated Markets</title><secondary-title>ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY</full-title></periodical><pages>1092-1131</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>administrative state</keyword><keyword>entrepreneurship</keyword><keyword>institutional theory</keyword><keyword>nonmarket strategy</keyword><keyword>principal–agent</keyword><keyword>regulated markets</keyword><keyword>regulatory discretion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0001839220911022</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://GRANDY HIATT State Agency Discretion and Entrepreneurship 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Barriers to entry in regulated markets are frequently conceptualized as static features that must be removed or overcome if new entrants are to successfully enter a market. But government institutions regulating markets often comprise multiple levels that exist in tension with one another due to differing incentives and motivations. We argue that the principal-agent tension between elected officials and agency bureaucrats may render regulatory barriers to entry more malleable, even in the absence of formal policy changes. To test this proposition, we bring the administrative state center stage and examine how regulatory discretion-regulatory agencies' flexibility to interpret and implement public policies created by elected officials-can influence the market entry of new ventures. Using data on regulatory approval of hydroelectric facilities in the United States from 1978 to 2014, we find that increased state agency discretion improves outcomes for new ventures relative to incumbent firms by freeing regulatory agency officials to interpret and implement policies according to a professional motivation of public service and reducing incumbents' political influence.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nicholson-Crotty, Jill</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nonprofit Organizations, Bureaucratic Agencies, and Policy: Exploring the Determinants of Administrative Advocacy</title><secondary-title>AMERICAN REVIEW OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMERICAN REVIEW OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</full-title></periodical><pages>61-74</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucratic lobbying</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>nonprofit organizations</keyword><keyword>policy process</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0275074009359681</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NICHOLSON-CROTTY Nonprofit Organizations Bureaucratic Agencies and Policy 2011.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Scholarly interest in the ways in which nonprofit organizations (NPOs) engage in the policy process has increased markedly in recent years, but one arena of participation about which we still know very little is administrative lobbying.

Although unfortunately policy studies are not very trendy in the general field of political science at the moment, they have been popular among Japan specialists for a long time and are still seen as mainstream. While some who do policy studies emphasize a structural approach (particularly in political economy) and others mostly employ a &quot;unitary rational actor&quot; model (particularly to analyze foreign policy), people like me try to relate aspects of political process (what bureaucracies, parties, or interest groups actually do) to the substance of policy (what governments do, why they implement one kind of policy-good or bad-rather than another). Any of these approaches to public policy can be substantially enriched by comparing Japan with other countries.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yackee, Jason Webb</author><author>Yackee, Susan Webb</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A bias towards business?

We analyze over 30 bureaucratic rules and almost 1,700 comments over the period of 1994 to 2001. We find that business commenters, but not nonbusiness commenters, hold important influence over the content of final rules. We also demonstrate that as the proportion of business commenters increases, so too does the influence of business interests. These findings contrast with previous empirical studies and generally suggest that notice and comment procedures have not succeeded in ``democratizing'' the agency policymaking process to the extent sometimes suggested in the normative rulemaking literature.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cunha, Bruno Queiroz</author><author>Pereira, Ana Karine</author><author>Gomide, Alexandre de Ávila</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State capacity and utilities regulation in Brazil: Exploring bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>Utilities Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Utilities Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>116-126</pages><volume>49</volume><keywords><keyword>Brazil</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>regulocrats</keyword><keyword>state capacity</keyword><keyword>utilities regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jup.2017.06.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://CUNHA ET AL State capacity and bureaucracy 2017.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Brazil</label><abstract>Different interest groups play a role in regulatory governance.

Four causal conditions are examined for the occurrence of higher levels of bureaucratic ``weberianess'' in the selected cases: historical sequence, political parties' institutionalization, electoral competition, and ethnic politics. The study employs the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to explore the expectation that each of these conditions' implications depends on other conditions' presence or absence. The findings disconfirm claims about the critical role of party system institutionalization for Weberian bureaucracies in new democracies. Besides, the analysis did not declare a professional public administration's prior existence before democratization as a necessary or sufficient condition for the outcome of interest. Finally, although the electoral competition was declared necessary for the outcome occurrence, it does not imply the same result if combined with ethnic politics.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Acs, Alex</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Policing the Administrative State</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF POLITICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF POLITICS</full-title></periodical><pages>1225-1238</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>oversight</keyword><keyword>presidency</keyword><keyword>regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>UNIV CHICAGO PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/698846</electronic-resource-num><notes>Text not available</notes><research-notes>Text not available</research-notes><urls/><abstract>Politicians react to administrative policy making by developing systems of oversight. Existing studies largely emphasize the advantages of reactive oversight, where politicians wait for interest groups to pull a fire alarm on noncompliant activity. Less attention has been paid to proactive oversight, where politicians police administrators directly. To evaluate the effectiveness of police patrol oversight, I look to the White House, which has been policing regulatory proposals since the Nixon administration. I show how policing, or regulatory review, has made agencies more responsive to the president, both by singling out noncompliant proposals and, critically, by shaping agency behavior in anticipation of review. My findings suggest that police patrol oversight is more efficient than previously acknowledged, notably because the associated deterrence effects yield low-cost compliance. I conclude with a discussion of why Congress, despite having similar incentives to control administrators, has not adopted a parallel system of policing.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Jongkon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Errors in public management and congressional oversight</title><secondary-title>Korean Journal of Policy Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Korean Journal of Policy Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>29-50</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>administrative delay</keyword><keyword>congressional oversight</keyword><keyword>management error</keyword><keyword>moral hazard</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LEE Errors in public management and congressional oversight 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>It is widely believed that “fire alarm” oversight (i.e., reactive oversight that responds to the complaints of interest groups) rather than “police patrol” oversight (i.e., precautionary congressional surveillance), better promotes the performance of government agencies by efficiently reducing bureaucratic moral hazard. However, fire alarm oversight can lead to bureaucrats being falsely accused by interest groups who provide biased information to members of Congress of failure to properly implement a policy, thereby causing an unnecessary administrative delay in public management.

Yet little is known about how these information Sources interact in the policy process as a whole. In this paper we consider this issue analytically, and develop a model of policy-making in which multiple sources of information - from the bureaucracy, an interest group, or a legislature's own in-house development can be brought to bear on policy. Lobbyists begin this process by selecting a venue - Congress or a standing bureaucracy - in which to press for a policy change. The main findings of the paper are that self-selection of lobbyists into different policy-making venues can be informative per se, and that this self-selection can make legislatures prefer delegation to ideologically distinct bureaucratic agents over ideologically close ones. Changes within the Federal Trade Commission during the 1970s are reinterpreted in the context of our model.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scheiner, Ethan</author><author>Pekkanen, Robert</author><author>Muramatsu, Michio</author><author>Krauss, Ellis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>When Do Interest Groups Contact Bureaucrats Rather than Politicians?

Despite the importance of this question for policymaking, democracy, and some prominent principal-agent understandings of politics, it is relatively unexplored in the literature. We argue that government stability plays a major part in interest groups' decisions. That is, central to interest groups' decisions is their assessment of the likelihood that politicians currently in power will continue to be in the future. We deduce logical, but totally contrasting hypotheses, about how interest groups lobby under such conditions of uncertainty and then test these using a heteroskedastic probit model that we apply to a unique longitudinal survey of interest groups in Japan. We find that when it is unclear if the party controlling the government will maintain power in the future, interest groups are more likely to contact the bureaucracy. When it is believed that the party in power will retain control for a considerable period, interest groups are more inclined to contact politicians. In addition, during times of government uncertainty, interest groups that are supportive of the governing party (or parties) are more likely to contact politicians and those that are less supportive will be more likely to contact bureaucrats.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lim, Seunghoo</author><author>Lee, Keon-Hyung</author><author>Suh, Hae Sun</author><author>Bae, Kwi-Hee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>To whom do bureaucrats need to respond?

It was one of the most controversial issues in the Korean healthcare delivery system. Drawing on the conflict-cycle view and stakeholder analysis, which was used to examine how multiple stakeholders influenced this policymaking process, this study examines 1) the role of Korean civil society (i.e., civic and special interest groups) in SDP reform and 2) why SDP reform led to unintended consequences. We argue that bureaucrats in the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoHW) should have played a central role in accommodating the public interest. Because they failed to do so, civic groups assumed major mediating and moderating roles. Due to the civic groups' lack of technical knowledge and professional experience, however, they played a limited role. In finalizing the proposal, therefore, bureaucrats were captured by strong interest groups, leading to unintended consequences, such as the increased use of non-covered services and higher healthcare expenditures. To ensure that the government serves the authentic public interest rather than special interest groups, bureaucrats should be responsible to the public rather than these interest groups. Moreover, civic groups should be strengthened (in relation to strongly organized interest groups) and included systematically in creating health policy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maux, Benoît Le</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Governmental behavior in representative democracy: a synthesis of the theoretical literature</title><secondary-title>PUBLIC CHOICE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PUBLIC CHOICE</full-title></periodical><pages>447-465</pages><volume>141</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>central and local government</keyword><keyword>flypaper</keyword><keyword>lobbying</keyword><keyword>median voter</keyword><keyword>partisan politicians</keyword><keyword>public goods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>SPRINGER</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11127-009-9463-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MAUX Governmental Behavior 2009 .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>What is the impact of bureaucratic behaviors on tax rates? What is preferable: a bureaucrat or a partisan politician? Does a flypaper effect occur when lobby groups influence public policies? This article tries to answer these questions by analyzing and comparing six different models of public choice: (1) the median voter model, (2) the Leviathan model, (3) the slack-maximizing model, (4) a general model of bureaucracy, (5) the partisan politicians model and (6) a general model of lobbying. Among several results, it is shown that the median voter's income and tax share almost always play a significant role in the design of the public good/tax package, even if the government does not explicitly try to maximize the median voter's utility. The article also provides a synthesis of the positive analysis of the flypaper effect.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dwidar, Maraam A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diverse Lobbying Coalitions and Influence in Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking</title><secondary-title>POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>199-240</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>coalitions</keyword><keyword>interest groups</keyword><keyword>rulemaking</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/psj.12431</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://DWIDAR Diverse Lobbying Coalitions and Influence in Rulemaking 2022.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Many studies have identified a line of influence between interest group lobbying and the federal bureaucracy's implementation of public policy. These works, however, have often focused on the influence of individual groups rather than coalitional efforts, which compose the majority of lobbying. Assessing this activity is critical to understanding the role of public participants in administrative policymaking. I test the influence of diverse coalitions of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs by analyzing a new dataset of organizations' co-signed public comments across nearly 350 federal agency rules proposed between 2005 and 2015. I find that agencies favor recommendations from organizationally diverse coalitions, and not coalitions that are bipartisan or dominated by business interests. Further, I find that coalition influence is heightened when lobbying in coalitions that are larger in size and more well-resourced, and when policy salience is low. I conclude that diverse lobbying coalitions help bureaucrats to shape the direction and content of regulatory law. This conclusion further establishes the role of organizational participants in bureaucratic policymaking and contributes to the debate over democratic legitimacy in the administrative state.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kukucha, Christopher J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lawyers, trees and money: British Columbia forest policy and the convergence of international and domestic trade considerations</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION-ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE DU CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION-ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE DU CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>506-527</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><publisher>INST PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION CANADA</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1754-7121.2005.tb01200.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Although the author focuses on a Canadian province, he explores the effects of the domestic policy.</notes><research-notes>Although the author focuses on a Canadian province, he explores the effects of the domestic policy.</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://KUKUCHA British Columbia forest policy 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Canada</label><abstract>International and domestic developments have a direct impact on forest policy in British Columbia. At the domestic level, the BC government maintains significant control over softwood lumber as a result of provincial land ownership, executive dominance, and the role of the Ministry of Forests. This is reinforced by a close relationship between the bureaucracy and key industry associations. Under the New Democratic Party government of the 1990s, however, the policy relevance of environment, labour, and aboriginal groups increased. The election of the BC Liberals, however, diminished these interests, with the possible exception of First Nations groups. It is also important, however, to acknowledge the significance of international developments. Institutionally, these pressures contributed to bureaucratic restructuring and a changing ``culture'' within the Ministry of Forests. Industry relations have also been influenced by consolidation of ownership, bilateral lumber disputes with the United States, and the increasing role of non-elected legal representatives. In addition, environment and labour interests were empowered by external funding, high export demands, and a low Canadian dollar. Although these developments have created an increasingly complex policy process, it is apparent that domestic considerations remain dominant, especially traditional participants, such as the Ministry of Forests and other specific setoral interests.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedersen, Helene H.</author><author>Binderkrantz, Anne S.</author><author>Christiansen, Peter M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lobbying Across Arenas: Interest Group Involvement in the Legislative Process in Denmark</title><secondary-title>LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY</full-title></periodical><pages>199-225</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/lsq.12042</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://PEDERSEN ET AL Lobbying Across Arenas 2014.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Denmark</label><abstract>Interest groups may approach political decision makers in two phases of the legislative process: the pre-parliamentary, administrative phase, in which bills are prepared by bureaucrats; and the parliamentary phase, in which bills are discussed and possibly revised by parliamentary committees.

Only bureaucrats are able to assess policy-relevant information coming from the interest group, but their interests may differ from those of politicians. In equilibrium politicians weigh the benefits of an informed policy decision against bureaucratic drift. We obtain that delegation occurs only when the bureaucracy is not too much biased and when the stakes of the interest group are not too high. Still, politicians sometimes prefer a biased bureaucracy and the interest group to have a larger stake. The model also predicts that interest groups typically lobby politicians to further delegation.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hesstvedt, Stine</author><author>Christensen, Johan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Political and administrative control of expert groups-A mixed-methods study</title><secondary-title>GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS</full-title></periodical><pages>1-21</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>WILEY</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gove.12599</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HESSTVEDT CHRISTENSEN Political and administrative control of expert groups 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Norway</label><abstract>Governments face a fundamental dilemma when asking expert groups for advice. Experts possess knowledge that can help governments design effective and legitimate policies. However, they can also propose different policies than those preferred by government. How do governments solve this conundrum? Through a mixed-methods study, the article examines politico-administrative control with expert advisory commissions in Norway. Arguing that both politicians and bureaucrats can take interest in limiting the gap between political/administrative policy preferences and expert group output, the article examines by what means they seek to control expert groups and how control varies across policy portfolios. It finds that while politicians rely on control by design, bureaucrats use both design and interventions. Moreover, political and bureaucratic controls are stronger in the area of financial/economic policy than elsewhere. The article makes a novel contribution to scholarship at the intersection of public administration and knowledge and policymaking.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kollmann, Andrea</author><author>Schneider, Friedrich</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Why does environmental policy in representative democracies tend to be inadequate?

Nevertheless, market-based instruments have not as yet been implemented satisfactorily in environmental policy. To identify the reasons for this insufficient implementation over the past decade, the Public Choice theory is used. The players' behavior is analyzed in order to show that their incentives for implementing market-based instruments in environmental policy, instead of command-and-control measures, are surprisingly weak. Knowing the obstacles to implementing market-based instruments provides valuable insight into how to overcome them.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tan, Qingshan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Democratization and bureaucratic restructuring in Taiwan</title><secondary-title>Studies in Comparative International Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studies in Comparative International Development</full-title></periodical><pages>48-64</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF02687470</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://TAN Democratization and bureaucratic restructuring in Taiwan 2000.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Taiwan</label><abstract>Taiwan has been moving toward democracy, with a dramatic transition taking place in the past decade. Critical to this transition is a restructuring of the relationship between the state bureaucracy and society. This study focuses on democratization's effect on Taiwan's bureaucracy. In particular, it seeks to examine such aspects of bureaucratic transformation as bureaucratic decisionmaking, legislative-bureaucratic politics, interest group-bureaucratic relations, the expansion of local autonomy, and civil service reform. This study finds that the bureaucratic state is facing a great challenge from political, legislative, and societal forces. The old type of insulated bureaucratic planning and decision making is no longer possible, the bureaucracy is losing its KMT patrons, and bureaucrats are finding themselves answerable to political pressure, legislative oversight, and interest group lobbying. While the bureaucracy has lost its previous level of discretion in terms of macro-management and the formulation of developmental policies, the bureaucratic state has not withered away.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rasiah, Rajah</author><author>Noh, Abdillah</author><author>Tumin, Makmor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Privatising healthcare in Malaysia: Power, policy and profts</title><secondary-title>Journal of Contemporary Asia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Contemporary Asia</full-title></periodical><pages>50-62</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Malaysia</keyword><keyword>healthcare</keyword><keyword>policy</keyword><keyword>power</keyword><keyword>private</keyword><keyword>public</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00472330802506790</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://RASIAH ET AL Privatising Healthcare in Malaysia 2009.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Malaysia</label><abstract>This article examines the hypothesis that interest groups are behind the increasing privatisation of healthcare services in Malaysia. The evidence supports the instrumentalist argument that powerful interest groups seeking profits, rather than real concerns for allocative efficiency, have been the prime drivers of healthcare privatisation in Malaysia. Not only have private healthcare expenditures risen more swiftly than government healthcare expenditure but, from 1982, public funds have also been used to purchase private services from public hospitals However, unlike simple class analyses, class contention manifesting through alliances between politicians, bureaucrats and capitalists has been a major force behind healthcare privatisation in Malaysia. The source of these developments can be traced to power wielded by the government to quicken the creation of a Bumiputera capitalist class that began to gain momentum from the late 1970s.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ku, Yenlin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Feminist activism within bureaucracy: Process of formulating and implementing regulations governing the protection of women's rights in Taipei</title><secondary-title>WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM</full-title></periodical><pages>176-185</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.wsif.2008.04.004</electronic-resource-num><notes>Although the case study is focused on local politics, it also approaches other general topics. - reavaliar</notes><research-notes>Although the case study is focused on local politics, it also approaches other general topics. - reavaliar</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://KU Feminist activism within bureaucracy 2008.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>China</label><abstract>This study documents and analyses the process of the formulation of the ``Regulations Governing the Protection of Women's Rights'' in Taipei, Taiwan, China a feminist experiment the author engineered as an activist in the City Government.

Second, building on the idea that policy-makers' legitimacy depends on the extent to which they can claim to represent some groups or social interests, we assess the extent to which Commission officials' preferences reflect European citizens' policy stance. Our results indicate a statistically significant positive correlation between the policy preferences of EU administrative staff and their home country population, which, we argue, can provide EU administrators a basic degree of legitimacy relative to their home country.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breig, Zachary</author><author>Downey, Mitch</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Agency breadth and political influence</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR &amp; ORGANIZATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR &amp; ORGANIZATION</full-title></periodical><pages>253-268</pages><volume>188</volume><keywords><keyword>agency design</keyword><keyword>money in politics</keyword><keyword>regulatory capture</keyword><keyword>regulatory politics</keyword><keyword>special interest groups</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>ELSEVIER</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jebo.2021.05.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BREIG DOWNEY Agency and Political Influence 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>We study, theoretically and empirically, legislative influence over executive agencies, focusing on the breadth of agency responsibilities.

This creates externalities of influence that are larger in broad agencies, deterring legislative influence. Empirically, we develop a novel lobbying-based measure of breadth and combine it with survey data on influence in 70 US federal agencies. Broad agencies report less influence, and we rule out several alternative explanations.

This article begins to unpack the conditions under which the bureaucracy responds to its stakeholders during rule making, and it is argued that bureaucratic responsiveness is conditioned on the level of attention provided by Congress and the President. This argument is tested with a dataset of forty rules and 1,444 interest group comments. Interest group influence is found to be constrained by congressional - but not presidential - attention to rule making. The results also shed light on Wilson's interest group theory of politics and suggest that the fragmentation of group preferences is less important than the central message sent by groups.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Potter, Rachel Augustine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bending the Rules: Procedural Politicking in the Bureaucracy</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>Chicago</pub-location><publisher>University of Chicago Press</publisher><notes>Not available</notes><research-notes>Not available</research-notes><urls/></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lim, Haeran</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS IN EAST ASIAN DEVELOPMENTAL STATES: FINANCIAL REFORM IN KOREA AND TAIWAN</title><secondary-title>ASIAN PERSPECTIVE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ASIAN PERSPECTIVE</full-title></periodical><pages>75-110</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>East Asia</keyword><keyword>Korea</keyword><keyword>Taiwan</keyword><keyword>democracy</keyword><keyword>developmental states</keyword><keyword>financial reform</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>KYUNGNAM UNIV, INST FAR EASTERN STUDIES</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1353/apr.2009.0026</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LIM Democratization Developmental States East Asia 2009.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Korea;Taiwan</label><abstract>This study explores the impact of democratization on financial reform in Korea and Taiwan. In Korea, democratization decreased the autonomy and efficiency of bureaucrats and increased the power of business groups, which led to unregulated financial liberalization. Crisis contributed to the urgency of reform, coalitional support, and burden sharing among people. After the crisis, the re-strengthened bureaucracy and weakened veto power of business and labor sectors resulted in ``path-breaking'' reform in Korea. In Taiwan, the historically conservative financial system remained stable, allowing Taiwan to escape the Asian crisis but later becoming obstacles to reform. Democratization decreased the autonomy of bureaucrats and increased money politics: Lack of consensus among parties, divided government, and opposition within vested interest groups led to ``lagged and stalemated'' financial reform in Taiwan.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shapiro, Stuart</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Speed Bumps and Roadblocks: Procedural Controls and Regulatory Change</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory</full-title></periodical><pages>29-58</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a003522</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SHAPIRO Procedural controls 2002.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>This study is an attempt to relate the effectiveness of the rule-making process to political controls on the bureaucracies that create regulations.

Scholars have both credited controls with allowing politicians to control future bureaucratic decision making and blamed controls for ossifying the regulatory process. This article considers eight case studies of state regulation of child care. These case studies cast doubt on the assertions that political controls play a prominent role in bureaucratic decision making. The rule-making decisions of bureaucrats in these case studies were influenced far more by executives and legislators in power and interest groups than by the presence or absence of procedural controls put in place by previous political officeholders.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bonica, Adam</author><author>McCarty, Nolan</author><author>Poole, Keith T</author><author>Rosenthal, Howard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Why Hasn't Democracy Slowed Rising Inequality?</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES</full-title></periodical><pages>103-123</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1257/jep.27.3.103</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BONICA Democracy Inequality 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US;revolving doors</label><abstract>During the past two generations, democratic forms have coexisted with massive increases in economic inequality in the United States and many other advanced democracies. Moreover, these new inequalities have primarily benefited the top 1 percent and even the top .01 percent. These groups seem sufficiently small that economic inequality could be held in check by political equality in the form of ``one person, one vote.'' In this paper, we explore five possible reasons why the US political system has failed to counterbalance rising inequality. First, both Republicans and many Democrats have experienced an ideological shift toward acceptance of a form of free market capitalism that offers less support for government provision of transfers, lower marginal tax rates for those with high incomes, and deregulation of a number of industries. Second, immigration and low turnout of the poor have combined to make the distribution of voters more weighted to high incomes than is the distribution of households. Third, rising real income and wealth has made a larger fraction of the population less attracted to turning to government for social insurance. Fourth, the rich have been able to use their resources to influence electoral, legislative, and regulatory processes through campaign contributions, lobbying, and revolving door employment of politicians and bureaucrats. Fifth, the political process is distorted by institutions that reduce the accountability of elected officials to the majority and hampered by institutions that combine with political polarization to create policy gridlock.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sigman, Hilary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The pace of progress at superfund sites: Policy goals and interest group influence</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; ECONOMICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; ECONOMICS</full-title></periodical><pages>315-344</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><publisher>UNIV CHICAGO PRESS</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/320273</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SIGMAN Policy Goals and Interest Group Influence 2001.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Bureaucracies may set priorities for their workload in response to social goals or pressures from concentrated private interests. This paper explores bureaucratic priorities empirically by studying Superfund, the federal program for cleaning up contaminated sites, It examines the amount of time that sites on Superfund's National Priorities List require to complete three stages from listing to cleanup, using an econometric method for multiple sequential durations. The empirical results provide little evidence that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prioritizes sites according to their harms. By contrast, concentrated private interests, such as liable parties and local communities, play an important role in the EPA's priorities. Delays caused by liable parties may reduce net benefits of cleanup by 8 percent. This result suggests a benefit from funding provision of environmental quality and other public goods through diffuse sources, such as broad-based taxes, to avoid the detrimental effects of such concentrated interests.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sağdıç, Öner Ersin Nail</author><author>Gümüş, Finer</author><author>Tuncer, Güner</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>THE IMPACT OF INTEREST GROUPS ON GOVERNMENT SIZE-REGIONAL EVIDENCE FROM TURKEY</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE JOVAN CVIJIC SASA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE JOVAN CVIJIC SASA</full-title></periodical><pages>151-161</pages><volume>71</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>pressure groups</keyword><keyword>public choice theory</keyword><keyword>public expendit</keyword><keyword>regional studies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>GEOGRAFSKI INST JOVAN CVIJIC SASA</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2298/IJGI2102151S</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SAGDIC ET AL Impacts Interest Groups Government 2021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Turkey</label><abstract>This study is aimed to investigate the regional pressure groups' effect on the government size in Turkey. According to the public choice theory, elections, political parties, interest and pressure groups, and bureaucracy significantly affect the public production process. Among these actors, pressure and interest groups directly affect variables such as economic growth and public expenditures. In this study, panel data analysis was used to observe the regional effect. The research data set covered 81 provinces of Turkey and the period between 2006 and 2018. According to the results, it was found that interest and pressure groups increase the public expenditures in the less developed regions in Turkey. These results are consistent with the empirical and theoretical studies. For this reason, the study has an important contribution to the literature. This study offers significant conclusions that public economic policies might be under the influence of interest and pressure groups. Even if stated that the results of this study might have many economic, demographic, social, and political reasons regarding Turkey, in the context of public choice theory, it could be seen as a significant indicator of not using public expenditure policies as efficient instruments. This situation shows that public resources are not used efficiently in Turkey and the government has a negative effect on the economy. To eradicate this negative effect, governments coming to power in the future ought to produce economic, political, and social policies in order to decrease the regional differences dramatically in Turkey.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Junyan</author><author>Zhang, Muyang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Friends with benefits: Patronage networks and distributive politics in China</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Economics</full-title></periodical><volume>184</volume><keywords><keyword>distributive politics</keyword><keyword>federalism</keyword><keyword>inter-governmental transfer</keyword><keyword>patron–client relations</keyword><keyword>political party</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104143</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://JIANG Patronage networks and distributive politics in China 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>China</label><abstract>Existing research on distributive politics mainly focuses on the influence of electoral competition between political parties, but less is known about non-electoral mechanisms of resource allocation inside a dominant party. This study examines how informal patron–client networks within the ruling Communist Party shape the distribution of intergovernmental transfers in China, a major one-party regime. Using a new dataset on city-level fiscal transfers and a novel method to infer informal political connections through past promotions, we show that provincial leaders allocate significantly more transfers to localities governed by officials who are part of their networks. This bias persists even when we use a specification that only exploits variations in connection caused by exogenous turnovers of higher level leadership. We evaluate two plausible motivations behind this bias—network-based policy coordination and collective corruption—and find evidence in stronger support of the former. Our findings suggest that private networks may function as an important, albeit costly, tool of mobilization in one-party systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Naseemullah, Adnan</author><author>Chhibber, Pradeep</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Patronage, sub-contracted governance, and the limits of electoral coordination</title><secondary-title>Comparative Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Comparative Politics</full-title></periodical><pages>81-100</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5129/001041518824414638</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://NASEEMULLAH CHHIBBER Patronage and Sub Contracted Governance India Pakistan 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>India;Pakistan</label><abstract>Electoral coordination is central to the creation of national party systems under first-past-the-post rules, but there are instances where we see such coordination fail even at the constituency level. In this article, we argue that electoral coordination requires partisan control of patronage distribution by local bureaucracies. In electoral constituencies in which bureaucrats do not hold a monopoly over the distribution of patronage, we might see constituency-level electoral fragmentation. In constituencies in which the bureaucracy controls patronage, however, effective coordination yields Duvergerian equilibria. We formulate and test this argument through constituency- and precinct-level analysis of Pakistani elections and additional evidence from Indian elections.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brassiolo, Pablo</author><author>Estrada, Ricardo</author><author>Fajardo, Gustavo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>My (running) mate, the mayor: Political ties and access to public sector jobs in Ecuador</title><secondary-title>Journal of Public Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Public Economics</full-title></periodical><volume>191</volume><keywords><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>close elections</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>public sector employment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104286</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BRASSIOLO ET AL Political ties and access to public sector jobs 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Ecuador;local politics</label><abstract>We show that local politicians' probability of being employed by a municipality increases when they have a strong party connection to its mayor. Using a regression discontinuity design, we compare the employment outcomes of individuals connected to the winner vis-à-vis those connected to the runner-up in close mayoral races in Ecuador. Among candidates to local councils who lose their bid, the probability of getting a job in the municipality increases tenfold when their own party's mayoral nominee is elected. The effect is very strong for low-ranking positions, which suggests that it is the result of political patronage. Three additional results shed light on where patronage is more likely to emerge. First, the effect is stronger in poorer municipalities, where public sector jobs are more valuable. Second, benefits go largely to politicians better positioned within the party structure. Third, the effect is concentrated among younger mayors, who have a longer career ahead of them to capitalize clientelist arrangements.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeng, Qingjie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Engineering popular support for long-ruling parties: The role of clientelism</title><secondary-title>Japanese Journal of Political Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Japanese Journal of Political Science</full-title></periodical><pages>75-92</pages><volume>20</volume><keywords><keyword>clientelism</keyword><keyword>dominant party</keyword><keyword>incumbency advantage</keyword><keyword>party duration</keyword><keyword>voter support</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S146810991900001X</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ZENG The Role of Clientelism 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Africa;quantitative comparative studies</label><abstract>In electorally contested regimes, the incumbent party often uses clientelist exchanges to stay in power long after its underlying electoral support has evaporated. Existing studies failed to examine how the role of clientelism changes with the increasing tenure of the incumbent party. Combining data from the Afrobarometer project and information about partisan turnover, this article shows that the longer a party has remained in power, the more clientelist exchanges in the form of club goods and patronage will serve to bolster popular support for the ruling party. This is mainly because lengthy party duration facilitates the politicization of bureaucracy and other state resources essential for clientelist exchanges. Understanding the evolving role of clientelism under electoral contestation has profound implications for the study of phenomena such as dominant-party rule and democratic erosion.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyer-Sahling, Jan-Hinrik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The rise of the partisan state?

A study of the ministerial bureaucracy reveals that the passing of public administration reforms has not provided an effective constraint against politicization, and that the politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy has increased over time in terms of extent, intensity and scope. Comparison of four post-communist governments in Hungary permits one to relate the politicization of the ministerial bureaucracy to the desire of governing parties to enhance their political control over the formulation and implementation of public policies under conditions of polarized political competition between former communists and their political allies, on the one side, and anti-communist parties, on the other.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jalali, Carlos</author><author>Silva, Patrícia</author><author>Moreira, Diogo</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Kopecký, Petr</author><author>Mair, Peter</author><author>Spirova, Maria</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Party Patronage in Portugal: Treading in Shallow Water</title><secondary-title>Party Patronage and Party Government in European Democracies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Party Patronage and Party Government in European Democracies</full-title></periodical><volume>9780199599</volume><keywords><keyword>control patronage</keyword><keyword>expert interviews</keyword><keyword>network organization</keyword><keyword>organizational resource</keyword><keyword>party government</keyword><keyword>party patronage</keyword><keyword>political parties</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>Oxford</pub-location><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199599370.003.0015</electronic-resource-num><notes>not available - requested through Research Gate</notes><research-notes>not available - requested through Research Gate</research-notes><urls/><label>Portugal</label><abstract>This chapter analyses patronage in contemporary Portugal.

On the basis of these assertions, scholars have tended to equate the number of state jobs with cases of patronage. By doing so, they have neglected the crucial issue of the scope of appointments effectively controlled by political parties. This article applies an innovative empirical inquiry to measure the extent of party patronage, assessing where, how deeply, and to what extent parties reach into the Argentine federal state structures. While the results by and large confirm the widespread notion of the broad scope of political appointments in Argentina, they re- fute the conventional hypothesis of a state thoroughly colonized by parties. Overall, the results suggest that parties' distribution of public jobs in the Argentine federal state is oriented less to mass-style patronage than to gaining effective and broad control over state institutions. © 2013 by the Latin American Studies Association.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ali, Sameen A.Mohsin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Party patronage and merit-based bureaucratic reform in Pakistan</title><secondary-title>Commonwealth and Comparative Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Commonwealth and Comparative Politics</full-title></periodical><volume>58</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Pakistan</keyword><keyword>bureaucratic reform</keyword><keyword>patronage</keyword><keyword>political calculus</keyword><keyword>political commitment</keyword><keyword>state capacity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14662043.2020.1743161</electronic-resource-num><notes>Exclusion criteria: provincial level</notes><research-notes>Exclusion criteria: provincial level</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ALI Patronage Bureaucratic Reform Punjab 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Pakistan;party patronage;provincial level;relationship between bureaucrats and parties</label><abstract>How do ruling political parties accommodate their members’ demand for access to state patronage with a push for merit-based bureaucratic reform?

Therefore, distortions in reform implementation reveal not only dynamics within the party itself, but also the significance of appointing the right bureaucrats to the right posts to regulate access to patronage.

Others assert that presidential appointments are highly constrained by senatorial 'folkways'. Still others argue that the bureaucracy is essentially uncontrollable via political appointments. In this paper, we present a stylized spatial model of presidential appointments and agency policy-making to explicate the conditions under which senators will constrain presidential appointments to independent agency boards. A key parameter for determining presidential influence is the direction (or absence) of policy drift induced by career bureaucrats' policy preferences. We show that presidential capture of independent agencies follows from favorable bureaucratic drift, but typically does not arise under adverse or zero drift. We illustrate the model via a simulation of appointments over time to an idealized agency board, identifying conditions under which rapid policy convergence on presidential preferences is possible.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Black, Ryan C.</author><author>Madonna, Anthony J.</author><author>Owens, Ryan J.</author><author>Lynch, Michael S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adding recess appointments to the president's &quot;tool chest&quot; of unilateral powers</title><secondary-title>Political Research Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Political Research Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>645-54</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Congress-presidential relations</keyword><keyword>presidential powers</keyword><keyword>recess appointments</keyword><keyword>separation of powers</keyword><keyword>unilateral presidency</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1065912907307541</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BLACK ET AL Recess Appointments PRQ 2007.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>In the struggle to control the federal bureaucracy, presidents have an overlooked but powerful tool: the recess appointment.

Presidents, the authors argue, should be more likely to make recess appointments to important policy-making positions, namely, major independent agencies.

Studies of politicization of public services are important because political involvement in management has often led to negative effects on service delivery. The article sets out a theoretical framework for political-administrative relationships, examining the growing politicization of public services, the impact of New Public Management (NPM) and political-administrative relationships in developing countries. It then looks at political-administrative relationships in South Africa, including the apartheid history, the development of a new framework in the democratic South Africa and politicization in the staffing of the public service. It examines three functional areas - the decentralization of powers, contract appointments and performance management - and discusses the implications of this changing framework for service delivery. The methodology consisted of interviews with a number of senior government officials, including three current directors-general and a former Minister for the Public Service and Administration, an analysis of government legislation, Public Service Commission (PSC) data including surveys, unpublished data of the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA), policy papers of the African National Congress (ANC) and an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study of political involvement in bureaucracies. The article concludes that growing politicization of the public service has contributed to poor service delivery, and that the South African government needs to place greater emphasis on merit as the basis for appointments and promotions. Points for practitioners This article is useful for professionals working in public management and administration because it looks at the following debates and issues, which have practical implications: frameworks for understanding political-administrative relationships in the public service; the impact of the politicization of staff in the public service; and how merit-based appointment can improve government effectiveness. The article also offers lessons to developing countries wishing to create more professional public services.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Srivastava, Anupam</author><author>Gahlaut, Seema</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Yoshihara, Toshi</author><author>Holmes, James R.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>The influence of bureaucratic politics on India's nuclear strategy</title><secondary-title>Strategy in the Second Nuclear Age: Power, Ambition, and the Ultimate Weapon</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Strategy in the Second Nuclear Age: Power, Ambition, and the Ultimate Weapon</full-title></periodical><volume>9781589019</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Georgetown University Press</publisher><notes>Not available - Requested through Research Gate</notes><research-notes>Not available - Requested through Research Gate</research-notes><urls/><label>India;political appointments</label><abstract>INDIA HAS PREMISED its nuclear strategy on developing an effective deterrent while at the same time pushing aggressively for a worldwide rollback of nuclear arsenals. Indian strategy, then, derives both from practical military concerns-the stark reality of nuclear neighbors to the subcontinent's east and west-and from a fervent, longstanding, apparently sincere devotion to the ideals of nonproliferation and disarmament. Scientific, technical, and doctrinal advances are critical to the military element of strategy, whereas forceful diplomacy carries forward the nonproliferation element. The dualism inherent in Indian thinking about nuclear weapons, which blends idealism uneasily with realism, helps explain the sometimes-quixotic character of Indian strategy. Like China and most other Asian continental powers, India confronts a complex, multidirectional, multifaceted strategic environment. Its traditional rival, Pakistan, lies to the northwest, and China is to the northeast. Rivals could station ballistic missile submarines in nearby waters or use the Indian Ocean's sea lanes to transport weapons-related matériel, menacing Indian security directly or abetting the proliferation of nuclear weapons to &quot;rogue regimes&quot; or nonstate groups. New Delhi's strategy, consequently, must come to terms with myriad factors. This chapter reviews four clusters of questions pertaining to Indian nuclear strategy in this strategic environment, with the aim of peering ahead to discern how New Delhi may manage strategy in the second nuclear age. One strand in India's atomic past that stands out in our account is bureaucratic politics and culture. Institutions promise to shape the making and execution of strategy, much as they have since the inception of the Indian nuclear program. Agencies bring distinctive worldviews to their endeavors. These views often clash during interagency initiatives, shaping-and at times misshaping-the products of these organizations' joint labors. The German sociologist Max Weber shed light on the benefits and drawbacks of bureaucracy. He depicted the bureaucratic method of organization as a marvel of efficiency, one of the cornerstones of the modern administrative state. He viewed bureaucracy as a kind of mechanical extension of the will of the sovereign, implying that these institutions could be relied on to carry out rulers' directives both swiftly and efficiently. The &quot;monocratic,&quot; or highly centralized, bureaucracy earned special plaudits from Weber, who maintained that, because it concentrated power in the hands of a few, accountable officials, was &quot;finally superior both in intensive efficiency and in the scope of its operations.&quot;1 It was rational in a way that more traditional modes of organization were not. Weber likened bureaucratic organizations to engineering systems; thus he insisted that the &quot;fully developed bureaucratic apparatus compares with other organizations exactly as does the machine with the non-mechanical modes of production.&quot; Such an apparatus boasted such virtues as precision, speed, &quot;strict subordination,&quot; and a &quot;reduction of friction and of material and personal costs.&quot;2 &quot;The choice,&quot; he insisted, was &quot;only that between bureaucracy and dilettantism in the field of administration.&quot; To be sure, enthusiasts of modern public administration did acknowledge, usually in a roundabout fashion, that bureaucratic institutions had some intrinsic shortcomings. Although they were well suited to performing routine functions, large organizations found it exceedingly difficult to alter their methods, even when the need for such change seemed compelling. Weber testified indirectly to the inflexibility of administrative institutions; he thus admitted that, once &quot;fully established, bureaucracy is among those social structures which are the hardest to destroy.&quot;4 The individual official was &quot;only a small cog in a ceaselessly moving mechanism which prescribes to him an essentially fixed route of march. The official is entrusted with specialized tasks, and normally the mechanism cannot be put into motion or arrested by him, but only from the very top.&quot; Only top leaders, then, could realistically hope to steer administrative organizations in a different direction. Because of their training and career incentives, lesser officials were invariably jealous of the interests of the overall organization. AsWeber explained, &quot;the individual bureaucrat is, above all, forged to the common interest of all the functionaries in the perpetuation of the apparatus,&quot; sometimes at the expense of the larger national interest.6 These elements made administrative institutions, built as they were on the &quot;settled orientation of man for observing the accustomed rules and regulations,&quot; extraordinarily resistant to change.7 Indeed, concluded Weber, modern administrative organization made real political revolution, &quot;in the sense of the forceful creation of entirely new formations of authority,&quot; practically impossible. Weber did pay tribute, albeit in an offhand and cursory way, to the notion that elected officials could impose their will on bureaucratic institutions through judicious personnel appointments. He posited that appointing carefully selected individuals to preside over the bureaucracy was better than electing them.9 The wisely chosen official acted as a &quot;Caesar,&quot; or &quot;a free trustee of the masses.10 By installing like-minded officials in the bureaucracy, elected officials stood at least some chance of inducing a course change in organizations that were highly resistant to outside pressure-even pressure from their formal superiors. At times, Indian political leaders have found it difficult to bend government agencies to their will in order to rationalize nuclear strategy. How they will fare at installing strong leadership-yoking these institutions to top-level policy and strategy-promises to be a key metric of Indian progress in fielding an effective deterrent. And whether they can design efficient institutional arrangements and install the right personnel to lead and manage them will be one arbiter of India's nuclear future. India's strong tradition of civil supremacy over military matters should help, but success is far from foreordained.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heywood, Paul</author><author>Meyer-Sahling, Jan Hinrik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Danger zones of corruption: How management of the ministerial bureaucracy affects corruption risks in poland</title><secondary-title>Public Administration and Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Administration and Development</full-title></periodical><pages>191-204</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>East Central Europe</keyword><keyword>Poland</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>corruption</keyword><keyword>state capture</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/pad.1644</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://HEYWOOD MEHLING SAHLING Ministerial Bureaucracy Corruption Poland 2013.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Poland</label><abstract>This article examines the relationship between management of the ministerial bureaucracy and the risk of high-level corruption in Poland. Four danger zones of corruption in the ministerial bureaucracy are distinguished, comprising the personalisation of appointments, the emergence of multiple dependencies, the screening capacity of the personnel system and the incentive of bureaucrats to develop a reputation of honesty and competence. Empirically, the article investigates the case of Poland from 1997 until 2007 and sets the findings in a comparative East Central European perspective. The article shows that corruption risks in the ministerial bureaucracy increased in most but not all danger zones after 2001 and, in particular, during the period of the centre-right governments that were in office between 2005 and 2007. The increase in corruption risks is reflected in Poland's deteriorating corruption record during the same period. The conclusion discusses the findings with regard to alternative causes of corruption and the relationship between civil service professionalisation and corruption in other East Central European countries.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bonica, Adam</author><author>Chen, Jowei</author><author>Johnson, Tim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Senate gate-keeping, presidential staffing of &quot;inferior offices,&quot; and the ideological composition of appointments to the public bureaucracy</title><secondary-title>Quarterly Journal of Political Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quarterly Journal of Political Science</full-title></periodical><pages>5-40</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>ideal point estimation</keyword><keyword>personnel decision making</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1561/100.00012085</electronic-resource-num><notes>Text not available - requested through Research Gate</notes><research-notes>Text not available - requested through Research Gate</research-notes><urls/><label>US</label><abstract>Article II Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives both the Senate and the President a role in the appointment of public bureaucrats. Yet, since the drafting of that constitutional passage, changes within the Senate and Executive have created new ways for officials to influence who gets appointed to the public bureaucracy. The Senate has developed intricate vetting procedures within its committees, while the Executive Branch has created new methods-such as the Schedule C designation-to facilitate the unilateral staffing of &quot;inferior offices.&quot; To what extent do these institutional changes affect the ideological composition of appointments to the public bureaucracy? Our formal theory predicts that the investigative procedures of Senate committees allow chairs to block ideologically disparate nominations, thus compelling presidents to nominate moderates to Senate-confirmed post while placing extremists in Schedule C positions. Empirical analyses support these predictions: the probability of Senate confirmation declines with a nominee's ideological distance from the relevant committee chair and Schedule C appointees exhibit greater ideological extremism than Senate-confirmed appointees. These findings reveal how modern, institutional modifications of Article II Section 2 influence both the ideological composition of appointed federal bureaucrats and the struggle for power between branches of the U.S. federal government.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wegerich, Kai</author><author>Hussain, Asghar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Creating accountability: representation and responsiveness of the irrigation bureaucracy in Punjab, Pakistan</title><secondary-title>Water International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water International</full-title></periodical><pages>662-681</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Pakistan</keyword><keyword>Punjab</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>civil service</keyword><keyword>empowerment</keyword><keyword>irrigation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02508060.2016.1185890</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://WEGERISH HUSSAIN Creating Accountability Pakistan 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://wle.cgiar.org/creating-accountability-representation-and-responsiveness-irrigation-bureaucracy-punjab-pakistan</url></web-urls></urls><label>Pakistan</label><abstract>Here, more than 100 years of incumbency reports on officers of the irrigation bureaucracy of Punjab, Pakistan, are presented and analyzed. The data highlight how representation changed before and after partition within the irrigation bureaucracy. The data show that the irrigation bureaucracy increased through staffing its representation of local communities and is in its appointments responsive to elected representatives. Therefore, it is argued that empowerment of the local community can be achieved without irrigation management transfer but through the irrigation bureaucracy itself.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyer-Sahling, Jan-Hinrik</author><author>Mikkelsen, Kim Sass</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Civil service laws, merit, politicization, and corruption: the perspective of public officials from five East European countries</title><secondary-title>Public Administration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Administration</full-title></periodical><pages>1105-1123</pages><volume>94</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/padm.12276</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://MEYER‐SAHLING - Politicisation and Corruption 2016.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>comparative studies</label><abstract>Research on bureaucracy and corruption tends to concentrate on cross-national research taking countries as the unit of analysis. Yet national-level measures neglect large differences within countries. This article therefore takes the perspective of individual bureaucrats. It studies how public officials' experience with bureaucratic institutions affects corruption within their sphere of work. Based on a survey of central government officials in five post-communist states, the article examines how public servants' views on civil service laws, the quality of their implementation, merit recruitment, and the politicization of appointments associate with rumours of kickbacks in their place of work. The analysis shows that merit recruitment is associated with less corruption, while politicization is associated with more corruption. In contrast, civil service laws are negatively associated with corruption only if they are properly implemented. The findings complement and qualify country-level research, approaching more closely the micro-foundations of the relation between bureaucracy and corruption.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krause, George A.</author><author>O'Connell, Anne Joseph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Experiential Learning and Presidential Management of the U.S. Federal Bureaucracy: Logic and Evidence from Agency Leadership Appointments</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Political Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Political Science</full-title></periodical><pages>914-921</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/ajps.12232</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://KRAUSE OCONNEL Experiential Learning and Presidential Management of the U S  Federal 2015.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Presidents become increasingly effective at managing the bureaucracy because of the information and expertise that they acquire from on-the-job experience. In their appointment choices, this theory predicts that presidents become better at reducing information asymmetries incurred from the bureaucracy (Agent Selection Learning), improve the vertical balance of leadership agent traits between top supervisory positions and subordinates directly beneath them (Agent Monitoring Learning), and place a greater relative premium on loyalty in response to horizontal policy conflict between the White House and the Senate (Common Agency Learning). This logic obtains empirical support from the analysis of bureaucratic agent traits for Senate-confirmed presidential appointees serving in leadership positions covering 39 U.S. federal government agencies from 1977 to 2009. Presidents’ appointment strategies reflect their increasing effectiveness at managing the bureaucracy, thus complementing their increasing reliance on administrative mechanisms to achieve policy objectives as their tenure in office rises.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baird, Marcello Fragano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From Sanitary Hegemony to Liberal Dominance: Investigating the Factors that Prevented a Liberal Inflection at the National Health Agency - ANS (2004-2014)</title><secondary-title>Dados</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dados</full-title></periodical><volume>62</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Brazilian National Health Agency (ANS)</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>government coalition</keyword><keyword>lobby</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/001152582019191</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://BAIRD Lobby Burocratas ANS 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>Brazil;political appointments</label><abstract>From Sanitary Hegemony to Liberal Dominance: Investigating the Factors that Prevented a Liberal Inflection at the National Health Agency-ANS (2004-2014) This paper analyzes the policy on supplementary health regulation conducted by the National Health Insurance Agency – ANS, in the Portuguese acronym. We investigated how power disputes between sanitarians and liberals were transposed to the agency through political appointments to management positions and how this influenced the institution’s regulation between 2000 and 2014. To characterize the political groups in the different administrations, we built networks of connections between politicians and ANS directors, examined the role of health insurance companies in supporting ANS leaders, as well as the profile of directors. To identify regulatory outcomes, we analyzed key decisions made and the voting pattern of directors. The research, based on mixed methods, used document analysis and interviews with 45 key actors in the sector, which were the basis for network analysis. The study revealed that after a period of sanitary domination, the most liberal groups in the ANS became the majority. However, these changes in the board did not result in pro-market regulations. This is explained by the political game, as well as by institutional and sectoral factors such as the lack of consensus in the market, the sanitary bureaucracy of the ANS, which acted as a brake on liberalizing measures, and the regulatory framework, which limits the power of the ANS regarding pro-market actions.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lowande, Kenneth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Politicization and responsiveness in executive agencies</title><secondary-title>Journal of Politics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Politics</full-title></periodical><volume>81</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>American politics</keyword><keyword>bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>politicization</keyword><keyword>president</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/700270</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LOWANDE American politics, bureaucracy, president, politicization 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US</label><abstract>Scholarship on bureaucratic responsiveness to Congress typically focuses on delegation and formal oversight hearings. Overlooked are daily requests to executive agencies made by legislators that propose policies, communicate concerns, and request information or services. Analyzing over 24,000 of these requests made to 13 executive agencies between 2007 and 2014, I find agencies systematically prioritize the policy-related requests of majority party legislators—but that this effect can be counteracted when presidents politicize agencies through appointments. An increase in politicization produces a favorable agency bias toward presidential copartisans. This same politicization, however, has a net negative impact on agency responsiveness—agencies are less responsive to members of Congress, but even less responsive to legislators who are not presidential copartisans. Critically, this negative impact extends beyond policy-related requests to cases of constituency service. The results suggest that presidential appointees play an important, daily mediating role between Congress and the bureaucracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Waterman, Richard W.</author><author>Ouyang, Yu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rethinking Loyalty and Competence in Presidential Appointments</title><secondary-title>Public Administration Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Administration Review</full-title></periodical><pages>717-732</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/puar.13212</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://WATERMAN OUYANG Rethinking competence presidential Appointments 2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>US;how to measure professionalization;political appointments</label><abstract>Studies in presidential appointments, particularly principal-agent models, posit that presidents employ a top-down strategy to control the bureaucracy, one that promotes loyalty over competence. However, many studies have two critical limitations: (1) treating loyalty and competence as binary constructs and (2) focusing only on presidential nomination and Senate confirmation (PAS) appointments. In this article, the authors construct a continuous measure of loyalty and competence to determine how much loyalty or competence an appointee offers a president and examine other appointment tools—Senior Executive Service (SES), Schedule C, and presidential appointments—that allow presidents to influence different levels of the bureaucracy. Findings show that presidents are more likely to reward competence with their PAS and SES appointments. In addition, few appointees score high on both loyalty and competence, explaining why presidents generally must make a trade-off between loyalty and competence.</abstract></record><record><database name="FinalCollection.enl" path="FinalCollection.enl">FinalCollection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Don S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Executive control of bureaucracy and presidential cabinet appointments in East Asian democracies</title><secondary-title>Regulation and Governance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Regulation and Governance</full-title></periodical><pages>82-101</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>East Asia</keyword><keyword>cabinet appointment</keyword><keyword>executive control of bureaucracy</keyword><keyword>presidential system</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/rego.12190</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://LEE Executive control of bureaucracy in East Asian Democracies 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>East Asia;comparative studies</label><abstract>This article examines the role of cabinet appointments in controlling the bureaucracy in presidential democracies. I demonstrate how administrative challenges stemming from the structure of the bureaucracy shape presidential choice of ministers. Analyzing a sample of four East Asian cases from 1986 through 2013, I find that presidents are more likely to select ministers from the civil service as bureaucracies are more professionalized, controlling for several political factors. Further evidence from qualitative interviews and case studies suggests that, in professionalized systems equipped with a sizable pool of talent but lacking responsiveness, presidents tend to promote ideologically aligned senior civil servants. However, in politicized systems, where presidents easily obtain responsiveness but face a low level of competence, policy experts tend to be selected from outside the bureaucracy. My findings have important implications for the regulatory governance and state capacity of East Asia, demonstrating the value of balancing between responsiveness and competence.</abstract></record></records></xml>
